0,POSITIVE,0.946153461933136,but the battery apple always behind
1,NEGATIVE,0.9824145436286926,just like the battery life of the garmin device now waiting for the forerunner 965 and i like all the data and have all the planned workout synced to either my garmin watch or garmin edge on the bike
2,POSITIVE,0.9709706902503967,even though i know the garmin ha the edge sport and battery wise the fact i can use my apple ultra without my phone to open my garage door act a a key for my car send receive message from my wife etc mean i am on the apple to be able to go for a run without the phone but still have the smart stuff when i need it is worth every bit for me
3,POSITIVE,0.9940750598907471,while the fitness feature on the garmin are awesome like you said with body battery yes i know i am tired with that said it is nice to be validated that i am not just being a baby the biggest reason i bought a fenix 7x is because it is feel bullet proof i am not worried about it bumping into thing not worried about water hurting it nothing i have played in snow climbed in rock ran in light rain hiked in heavy rain it just doe not matter that and physical button wa a huge point for me
4,NEGATIVE,0.9963396787643433,a a long distance i e at pct etc hiker who also run and doe strength training i prefer the garmin this mostly boil down to fitness tracking durability battery life when i hike always have my phone so there is zero reason to have an apple watch i have the enduro 2 and the battery life is top notch there are leg of the hike that might be 4 5 day between resupply town and not having to charge every day is key however a an iphone user i really would like to use an apple watch if it could last 4 5 day of all day tracking between charge
5,NEGATIVE,0.867911696434021,mark lewis there is not too much of a learning curve to their eco system then again i have the pace 2 their dollar200 entry level model even though i do not know how entry level it is if eliud kipchoge is pro model is also a pace 2 pro snappy gps tracking probably the best battery life of any running watch no frill functionality every sensor bell and whistle i could ever need compass barometer thermometer and can even gauge my running watt by itself con not the most customizable activity display sure but not much else though it doe not need to be on the pace 2 anyway no nav just tracking the more expensive model do nav i believe though i would not think killian jornet would have a pro model with them if they did not have a nav ready model i do not think it is controversial to say that the coros pace 2 is the best sub dollar200 running watch on the market
6,NEGATIVE,0.9872764945030212,the perfect sport watch would be one that give you very basic data with a massive fuck off battery life basically the 920 with a new battery and new gps no toss given about anything else people should never listen to a watch over their body
7,NEGATIVE,0.9996476173400879,i would live with an ugly unsporty apple watch if it battery would last the length of an all day bike ride or all day run
8,NEGATIVE,0.9993904829025269,i used to have apple watch but after half a year i sold it reason one day battery is horrible worst thing wa when i went for a hike full battery got back 5 hour later and aw wa dead after that i bought fenix 6 pro and i am happy a i could be probably would upgrade it to regular size or even large version but that ha a year or so to wait
9,NEGATIVE,0.9975480437278748,the same here mate i had a bad cold and my body battery wa at 5 and stress raised
10,NEGATIVE,0.9979780316352844,same switched from aw to garmin once i went for a long trip forgot the cable so had to turn off phone connection to save battery and realized how great is it now i only connect them to transfer my run
11,NEGATIVE,0.993762195110321,jon kc no i do mean hearing it work a a mini bluetooth speaker for my phone
12,NEGATIVE,0.9993867874145508,jon kc yeah many of these cheap watch can be used a speaker for your phone i had one and the speaket could be used to take call and watch video
13,NEGATIVE,0.9977422952651978,why do not they just make a nice looking watch that dose notification it all most people use anyway loose all the fitness stuff most people do not want there watch telling them they do not go to the gym and them that do know what they have done loose the sleep tracking thats when it on charge loose the apps 90percent are pointless anyway make it look like a watch with the added bonus you can put them cotton strap that loop through the pin hey you might get decent battery life aswell somtimes le is more and simple is the beutifull
14,NEGATIVE,0.9787848591804504,hk9 pro aron that is the one to compare amoled screen same menu same strap perfect working screen it is just 40 dollar
15,POSITIVE,0.9997997879981995,i recently purchased the ultra watch and just love it battery is amazing and screen size is nice to interact with apps definitely would recommend
16,NEGATIVE,0.9963219165802002,i had a couple thing about the ultra that made me decide against buying it the biggest issue wa it is large to fit comfortably on my wrist and the watch can be a bit heavy the thing also wa the ultra wa hard to put under my long sleeve shirt i have smaller then normal hand and wrist for a man and the ultra wa just to large heavy and awkward for me being that i am retired and wanted an apple watch to monitor my heart and temperature reading i went to the series 8 41 mm i do not need cellular connection on the watch a i have my phone with me all the time i just could not justify spending another dollar120 00 a year added to my cellular plan and having a extra dollar100 00 for the watch the ultra is just not what i wanted and the se just wa not enough i also do not really have a use for the stainless model so i went with the aluminum the way to save money is also fish for the discount and by a short fishing trip over to the apple veteran and military website i found 10percent off on the site so that dollar400 00 watch wa dollar360 00 the ultra is just to much and the se not enough and the series 8 wa just right my pervious apple watch wa the original version that lasted until last month before the battery died so this wa a nice update
17,NEGATIVE,0.999675989151001,i am not a smart watch person just shopping for mom what throw me off is why they have been using the same chip for so long if the battery last le than a day
18,NEGATIVE,0.9887920022010803,to be honest i just want a series 7 with the battery life of a ultra
19,NEGATIVE,0.9728958010673523,i am still using the series 4 but that ultra doe look nice update got the ultra and it is pretty cool but the battery dy significan notly faster while using cellular
20,NEGATIVE,0.9968746900558472,the ultra cost 1000euros in europe battery last hardly a day that s insane shame on you tim cock
21,NEGATIVE,0.9821102023124695,dan r i just made another a test for battery using the wayfinder face switching it to dark mode only and it lasted 3 day without the need to use low power mode
22,NEGATIVE,0.9993721842765808,ultra too expensive and watch 8 too little battery life if watch 8 had 36 hr battery life with full use i could get that
23,NEGATIVE,0.6821620464324951,best bang for the buck because of the battery life hahaha what a joker
24,NEGATIVE,0.9988547563552856,lol i don really think much people will buy the ultra it is so damm expensive and there are many competition out like especially garmin which the battery life are measured in month
25,POSITIVE,0.9366528987884521,apple usually underestimate it watch battery life so hitting 48 doe not sound too difficult for it plus energy saving mode is still available
26,NEGATIVE,0.9960773587226868,18 hour the galaxy watch 5 get 50 why can not apple improve the battery life
27,POSITIVE,0.9981491565704346,i finally upgraded my series 5 and got lucky with a series 7 for 220dollar picked up locally it wa also sealed so i have been using it for a couple day and the bigger screen 2 day of battery life have been amazing
28,NEGATIVE,0.9875352382659912,massive 36 hour battery life bruh
29,NEGATIVE,0.9932252764701843,do the cellular model use the same modem a the iphone 14 is i am curious when apple switch to their own modem design if battery life will increase
30,NEGATIVE,0.9993615746498108,what doe the screen brightness have to do with it looking toyish or not lol it will likely have an ambient light sensor which mean it will only reach 2000nits in the very brightest outdoor condition you do not want that thing blaring at 2000 nit very often not only will the pretty poor battery life be even poorer but the oled display will take a beating aswell brightness and oled is do not go well they degrade faster the brighter they go
31,NEGATIVE,0.951044499874115,i like the extra battery and brightness of ultra i like feel and look of stainless steel so confused
32,NEGATIVE,0.997972309589386,i got this watch for the same reason i got my 14 pro max longevity and resale value the le i have to charge these device the better it is for the battery
33,NEGATIVE,0.9990144968032837,like the look but price is ridiculous and battery still a disappointment for a watch for that price
34,NEGATIVE,0.9978761672973633,but is not the series 8 about the same price stainless steel a the ultra watch without all the bell and whistle of the ultra no titanium no special sapphire glass no double battery life no action button etc question though on the series 8 can you get a wifi only version for le or do they all have the option to add a cellular plan if you choose to do so i know the ultra come with cellular a something you can add a plan or not but did not know if the series 8 is like the ipad where you can get one that is wifi only or pay more for one that ha a cellular option at least
35,NEGATIVE,0.916827917098999,i love my ultra i am a photographer and can spend 10 hour out the ultra last all day and still have 75percent sometimes even 90percent battery left i have had it since launch and the battery health is still 100percent a it probably only get one full battery cycle every week it really is an impressive device obviously it not a long lasting a the garmin watch in battery life but in feature it is hard to beat the ultra
36,NEGATIVE,0.9969520568847656,i would buy an apple watch with a mip display and 28 day battery life until then the ultra thing is a bit of gimmick
37,NEGATIVE,0.974590539932251,i have both the ultra and the aluminum midnight series 8 love them both ultra for workout the great battery and the cell option it is just too big for my very small wrist unfortunately the series 8 i use for a daily driver and to wear my pretty watch band
38,POSITIVE,0.9982459545135498,because of your last video on awu craig i decided to go with two regular aw7s same price a one awu love them unlimited battery life with no charging downtime one on wrist one on charger and for my marathon runner life having two normal size watch is amazing love that apple io ha that instant automatic swap built in so popping on the other watch is seamless thanks for guiding me in the right direction for my life
39,NEGATIVE,0.9995218515396118,however the design the fact that i am forced to use an iphone to use this watch and i love my solar garmin hard to think 2 day of battery a good when my solar garmin fenix 7 sapphire for about the sa e price last month or so ha one app that cover all and phone not limited can even pair to an iphone also it is basically ugly
40,NEGATIVE,0.9920204281806946,still not solar like my year old fenix 7 sapphire solar which need charge once a month or so touchscreen etc plus it is round round
41,NEGATIVE,0.9987664222717285,when i bought the watch i thought it will have a real always on and bright screen but it still dims like any other apple watch

43,NEGATIVE,0.998381495475769,the only weakest point is the battery 36 h is not enough they can do better this watch can save life is god forbid example lost in a forest stuck in building during earthquake emergency 911 whatever reason it can do a lot lot thing but battery my be the reason
44,POSITIVE,0.9985687732696533,this watch is for people that hike and dive and adventure me being 6 6 and fat ooooh it is got a big as screen
45,POSITIVE,0.8176590800285339,a a non water person or traveler i need this for it multi day battery only it is annoying charging every night i forget to strap it on often lol and the screen is bigger

50,NEGATIVE,0.9899437427520752,love the battery but i still want more battery life a whole week worth of battery and it should still only take a hour to charge good luck apple
51,POSITIVE,0.9559440612792969,elderly like my mom that need larger and brighter screen not tech savvy need battery life and need the safety feature like fall alert sound extreme but service that do fall alert usually charge like dollar50 a month which make apple watch ultra all the sudden sound reasonable dollar10 a month for cell service and watch pay for itself versus cost of fall alert service within a year plus provides her a lot accessibility feature than just fall alert
52,NEGATIVE,0.9946519136428833,so if you decide to go someweare in nature or mountain or lake you can not without power bank and price it to funny it worth maybe 300 400dollar not 800 there is so much better batery friendly watch for le money shame on you apple
53,NEGATIVE,0.9965233206748962,would be great if smartwatches could charge itself due to a small solar panel thing in the screen
