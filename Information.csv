My only sadness in wearing the Fenix 24/7 is i miss wearing my other watches because i do love watches and now they are sitting there getting no use.', 'Oh thank god thought we were going to have to stop watching üòÖ', 'Garminions Rejoice!! ‚åö', 'I switch back and forth between the AW Ultra and the Epix Gen 2. While ditching both of them might be a step too far, I would like to eventually settle on one device. Also, good to see Dinton in the video!', 'Recently upgraded from Garmin FR 935 to Garmin Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar. Love it!! I swim, bike, run (triathlon) and more ... and absolutely love the look, feel and functionality of the Garmin 7X. I also use Garmin Connect and Training Peaks. I also have a Rolex, which I love and wear as needed.  But it&#39;s Fenix 7X for everyday wear. I was never inclined to buy the Apple watch - although I have many other Apply products, i.e. Laptop, iPad, iPhone. The watch just never appealed to me. I am rarely without my iPhone, so what&#39;s the point of the watch. Anyway, to each his own. No judgment. Thanks for the continued authentic content! Cheers! PS. I&#39;m vegan and a Starbucks fan!', 'CBUM says sumo deadlift is for losers...', 'Love my Forerunner 955. Lightweight and pretty much everything you‚Äôd want from a sports watch.  Best thing about it is that it doesn‚Äôt have an amoled display.', 'Pretty fair take. I&#39;ve been locked in on Apple since v2 and been happy with it. For me. I&#39;m also leveraging a lot more of its smartwatch features, like unlocking my computer and opening the faculty office door at Uni. I&#39;m a decidedly below average runner so the better Garmin features are likely lost on me, at least for now.', 'I find the Fenix is worth keeping for real exercise. Things like mountain biking, the AWU just doesn&#39;t seem to be tuned to that kind of workout. Fat biking in the winter, it always underestimates the effort.\xa0<br><br>But on a long road ride I wear the AWU and let my Wahoo track the ride. The AWU beats carrying a phone, and I can buy essentials like slurpees and beers with it. <br><br>So, like you I opted to keep both.', 'I wish service coverage in Australia was good enough to leave my phone at home like that. I love m‚Äôy Garmin but would also love the ultra. I haven‚Äôt been on a naked run for a very long time', 'Spot on Mark.  Nice one. I just took off my Apple Watch which and kept on the table (Only time that is off my wrist is either when its charging or what I am in shower) and it is so liberating. I think we need disconnect from this tech on the wrist often.  As you said, if Garmin comes up with having AW like LTE/mobile services in next Fenix or EPIX, I am switching sides- I know I just contradicted myself there (Liberation and going back to being slave to tech).  Cheers Mark.  Take Care.', 'Great review as always. The main reason that keeps me within the Garmin Ecosystem is the fact that I have over 15 yrs of data on Garmin Connect. I am not sure how to simply import data from non Garmin devices.', 'Biggest problem with the Apple watch is that you need an iPhone too. Put the two together and that&#39;s expensive.', 'I already spend too much time looking at my phone. I dont want another phone on my wrist.', 'Great video as usual, but I have to draw the line at &quot;Naked Running&quot;, No Data, not forever immortalized on Strava - your talking crazy talk now!!!!!', 'can an apple watch be connected to a chest trap?', 'I love that bit.. &quot;did you wake up ? yes.. do you feel good....&quot;, <br>I am also of a similar age.., and I basically do the same thing. as long as the little ppl aren&#39;t rustling about.., I am out the door to run, or to the gym, before they are off to school. great video.', 'Wear both mate. Keep the jocks and vegans happy.', 'I liked the Ultra but I just hated that they didn&#39;t have software to compare to Garmin Connect.  I ended up with an Epix 2 and have been happy.  Apple is getting closer and closer but I&#39;m sticking with Garmin for now.', 'Having decided that both devices have their benefits‚Ä¶ I think the more important question is how do you use the data to support your fitness journey and goals. What are you actually measuring? How do the measurements taken direct or improve the training regime you‚Äôre following? Having analysed the output from the device have you ever worked out that you need to more of this or less of that to meet your goals?', 'What about shoes for the pups', 'For me the epix 2 has been inaccurate in almost everything except hiking. Even the OHR is sluggish while spinning, takes forever to catch up with the peaks. So I kept it just for that, hiking. For everything else I use the ultra.']"

He uses garmin for exercise and cycling and apple for everything else. I bought an epix2 for myself and love it. But I agree, I hate the look of apple watch. There is no watch face I could find that made it look like garmin. BUT, it does few things better than garmin and for that reason, I might (just might) get one for daily wear.', 'I think your point is so important. I think a lot of people including myself look at the data and it just stresses them self. I found myself wondering if I drank enough water, if I slept well enough, if I should take a day off.

I am not an Apple fan of anything of theirs, so the Fenix is great.', 'I‚Äôm not willing to spend on multiple watches and don‚Äôt like notifications/phone on the wrist. I got the Fenix 7 DLC with the link strap and its perfect. Looks smart enough at any time I need it to and swap out the band for sport time.

Last month I bought a used Fenix 6X Pro as I felt like I wasn‚Äôt advancing my training. I absolutely love the Fenix, used it nonstop for a month without my Apple Watch.

I hate the Garmins lack of integration, I hate how big it is.  It gets caught on long sleeve shirts, backpacks, and gloves.  I bang it against every doorway I walked through and definitely sucks to swim with because of its size.  Sure apples battery still sucks compared to Garmin and it could be more sporty in looks, but for my triathlons, 100-200 mile bike rides and 32 mile trail runs my Ultra works for me much better then Garmin.', 'Nixon doesn‚Äôt need one, that‚Äôs good enough for me!']"

No phone in hand checking the screen frequently as you walk around. It&#39;s a game changer if you travel a lot. There&#39;s no Google Maps nav on the Fenix/Forerunner&#39;s and the 3rd party Connect apps I tried were terrible.', 'Sounds like common sense to me. I have an Apple Watch 8 and a Garmin forerunner 245. I like the convenience of the Apple Watch so use that most of the time. But I still keep the Garmin for when I think the Garmin would be better. I had the Garmin first and it‚Äôs fantastic as a sports watch, but I found it a bit bulky to wear comfortably all of the time, and its smart functions are not that great. I would be happy with either if I just had one though, but as a choice I would choose the Apple.']"

I have the Enduro 2 and the battery life is top notch. There are legs of the hike that might be 4-5 days between resupply/town and not having to charge EVERY day is key.

A beginner or an amateur will benefit immensely from incorporating data in their training to get an objective feedback about their effort and state of recovery. Now I dont mean you HAVE to use these things.

I&#39;ve worn every apple watch since Apple Watch 1 (day and night) and after wearing the Ultra for 2 days (and nights) straight, the bone under my watch started to feel sore, such that I had to take the watch off briefly for relief. I thought I&#39;m wearing it too tight but after another day of adjustments, I gave up as my wrist could no longer bear it. Comparing it with my Apple Watch 5 (which I replaced), I noticed the glass used for the bottom sensor is more pronounced, has more depth and roundness and literally digs into your wrist. This &quot;digging&quot; into my wrist was what was giving me the sore bone. This, and the discomfort when scrubbing the crown (as it was very abrasive to my skin touching it as the crown would push the watch down every time I would turn it). The crown is big, has sharp edges and pinches. The top surface also has a very edgy, sharp wall around it (for protection) but if you&#39;ve got the habit of swiping from the edge of the screen (as you would on older generations), your finger will swipe over the sharp edges and it&#39;s not a pleasant experience. The additional weight of the watch, the constant pinching, soreness, uncomfortable overall &quot;squareness&quot; as it sits tall on your wrist, leaning on one side was just too much to handle. Overall I gave up after 3 days and am returning it.

Case in point: How many people complain that their cellphone doesn&#39;t last a month? No one. Why? Well that&#39;s unrealistic, and also because charging your phone isn&#39;t a big deal. Why is charging your watch suddenly a big deal? Not many real world reasons, it&#39;s just a feature that we&#39;re used not and not one we actually use.<br><br>First, I bet most fitness watch users don&#39;t go weeks without charging their watch. Secondly, it&#39;s not much of an inconvenience to charge Apple Watch once a day or once every couple of days unless you really want to track sleep, and even then when you wake up you can put it on the fast charger while you get ready for the next hour then throw it on for the rest of the day. Thirdly, one of the reasons why multi-week battery life is likely a big deal is because charging most other fitness watches is clumsy and not convenient. My Garmin Fenix 6X Pro Solar has a wonky proprietary charger and it&#39;s not very convenient to charge, so I rarely make the effort to charge it. My Apple Watch, on the other hand, is super easy to charge with it&#39;s magnetic wireless charger.<br><br>So I think this whole &quot;battery must last a month!&quot; is just a talking point rather than a feature that most fitness watch users actually use. And when they do, it&#39;s likely because charging isn&#39;t easy and intuitive. This requirement is like pixel peeping with pro cameras: Does it actually make a real world difference?

You can actually buy a smartwatch with a replaceable cell battery that lasts for an entire year but the catch is that the watch is a hybrid smartwatch, and hybrid smartwatches prioritise being a watch over being a smart device. Ironically the first ever smartphone that paired to a phone was actually a hybrid smartwatch; the Sony Ericsson MBW-100. This watch was a mechanical watch with an LED display at the bottom for notifications and music and had playback controls on the side, and incredibly there are still watches that follow similar principles. <br><br>The most modern ones I&#39;ve seen use E-ink displays as the watch face with hands that will move out of the way whenever you get a notification or navigate through certain menus and settings (one of the popular examples of a watch with this setup being Fossil&#39;s Hybrid HR watches). These however don&#39;t have replaceable batteries but do have rechargeable batteries that only need recharging once every 2 weeks.<br><br>But another type is a hybrid watch that has no display at all and will instead point to a number on the dial that you can assign to notifications relating to an app or a contact. Personally I&#39;ve not had a good experience with Fossil&#39;s versions of these watches (on Android I had syncing issues and on iOS it would only accept notifications from apps that Fossil had personally whitelisted...no idea why, especially since their Hybrid HR watches support all apps but that&#39;s how it is) but there are other companies that make these, including none other than Armani.

Also, for those who are doing multi-day hikes in the backcounty, the extra battery life is great, but when you are constantly running GPS to track your mileage and route, Compass, etc., that battery life I&#39;m sure is much lower than the rating.

First, I sleep with my watch to collect sleep data (for HRV and recovery status) and love that I can go about two weeks without a charge. Any time I take the watch off, it creates gaps in my data, whether it&#39;s sleep data, steps, HR, stress, calories, etc. I accept these gaps and blind spots every 10 to 12 days, but wouldn&#39;t want them every 2 days let&#39;s say. Second I use my watch mostly for cycling. As such, the Garmin is designed to really work in complement with my head unit (Garmin Edge 1030 Plus) when I ride outside or my Wahoo Kickr Bike when I ride inside on Zwift. On rides, I can use the Broadcast Heartrate feature and pair my watch using ANT+/BT and it can replace a traditional HR monitor. Again, I don&#39;t use my Fenix as a bike computer, but on some rides I use it as a HR monitor to pairs to my bike computer. Pretty sure that&#39;s a no-go for the Apple Watch. Last reason is the lack of solar charging.

No web browser anymore? Needing to disconnect the watch from the iphone even if you have a celluar model, if your iphone is trying to connect to a wifi network your not connected to. Because you cant disconnect from the phone, from the watch anymore. <br>I had a series 2 I never updated and it had web browser built in, I could play music from the watch, &amp; the keyboard app I used to messages was in the app store an worked. <br>Fast forward to OS 8 &amp; getting a better watch. Those features are gone? <br><br>I want apple to make there watch line more co-hesive with software. Why is a 2017 series 3 model being sold in 2022? It couldn‚Äôt at least be a 4? It would allow more longevity. The SE model should have more features for its price imo. &amp; the screen size of the SE shouldnt exclude it from a basic needed feature.

The features they keep taking are literally from the palm pre &amp; pixi. I remember wireless charging coming out. 2010 I had it then for 5 years an iphone I didnt have it. They make it and you dont get a wireless charger with it like the palm pre line? <br>Then all the new features like multitasking, open windows, etc all things a 2010 phone had. Its funny with the notch because palm did the same layout with wifi time and service on the top of the pixi to save room. So in some aspects I feel like my I-phone is turning into a palm phone lol.

A watch rated with 50m water resistance means it is splash resistant. So you can shower with it, you can do sport with it and you can go out in the rain with it.

And you definitely shouldn‚Äôt dive 50m with the watch. There are many watches rated with 50m and you still can swim with them but you never know which watch you gonna destroy. I would say that most Apple watches will survive swimming but one shouldn‚Äôt be angry if the watch dies someday while swimming (especially when the watch is older already and the seals are not as safe as they were in the beginning).
