My only sadness in wearing the Fenix 24/7 is i miss wearing my other watches because i do love watches and now they are sitting there getting no use.', 'Oh thank god thought we were going to have to stop watching 😅', 'Garminions Rejoice!! ⌚', 'I switch back and forth between the AW Ultra and the Epix Gen 2. While ditching both of them might be a step too far, I would like to eventually settle on one device. Also, good to see Dinton in the video!', 'Recently upgraded from Garmin FR 935 to Garmin Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar. Love it!! I swim, bike, run (triathlon) and more ... and absolutely love the look, feel and functionality of the Garmin 7X. I also use Garmin Connect and Training Peaks. I also have a Rolex, which I love and wear as needed.  But it&#39;s Fenix 7X for everyday wear. I was never inclined to buy the Apple watch - although I have many other Apply products, i.e. Laptop, iPad, iPhone. The watch just never appealed to me. I am rarely without my iPhone, so what&#39;s the point of the watch. Anyway, to each his own. No judgment. Thanks for the continued authentic content! Cheers! PS. I&#39;m vegan and a Starbucks fan!', 'CBUM says sumo deadlift is for losers...', 'Love my Forerunner 955. Lightweight and pretty much everything you’d want from a sports watch.  Best thing about it is that it doesn’t have an amoled display.', 'Pretty fair take. I&#39;ve been locked in on Apple since v2 and been happy with it. For me. I&#39;m also leveraging a lot more of its smartwatch features, like unlocking my computer and opening the faculty office door at Uni. I&#39;m a decidedly below average runner so the better Garmin features are likely lost on me, at least for now.', 'I find the Fenix is worth keeping for real exercise. Things like mountain biking, the AWU just doesn&#39;t seem to be tuned to that kind of workout. Fat biking in the winter, it always underestimates the effort.\xa0<br><br>But on a long road ride I wear the AWU and let my Wahoo track the ride. The AWU beats carrying a phone, and I can buy essentials like slurpees and beers with it. <br><br>So, like you I opted to keep both.', 'I wish service coverage in Australia was good enough to leave my phone at home like that. I love m’y Garmin but would also love the ultra. I haven’t been on a naked run for a very long time', 'Spot on Mark.  Nice one. I just took off my Apple Watch which and kept on the table (Only time that is off my wrist is either when its charging or what I am in shower) and it is so liberating. I think we need disconnect from this tech on the wrist often.  As you said, if Garmin comes up with having AW like LTE/mobile services in next Fenix or EPIX, I am switching sides- I know I just contradicted myself there (Liberation and going back to being slave to tech).  Cheers Mark.  Take Care.', 'Great review as always. The main reason that keeps me within the Garmin Ecosystem is the fact that I have over 15 yrs of data on Garmin Connect. I am not sure how to simply import data from non Garmin devices.', 'Biggest problem with the Apple watch is that you need an iPhone too. Put the two together and that&#39;s expensive.', 'I already spend too much time looking at my phone. I dont want another phone on my wrist.', 'Great video as usual, but I have to draw the line at &quot;Naked Running&quot;, No Data, not forever immortalized on Strava - your talking crazy talk now!!!!!', 'can an apple watch be connected to a chest trap?', 'I love that bit.. &quot;did you wake up ? yes.. do you feel good....&quot;, <br>I am also of a similar age.., and I basically do the same thing. as long as the little ppl aren&#39;t rustling about.., I am out the door to run, or to the gym, before they are off to school. great video.', 'Wear both mate. Keep the jocks and vegans happy.', 'I liked the Ultra but I just hated that they didn&#39;t have software to compare to Garmin Connect.  I ended up with an Epix 2 and have been happy.  Apple is getting closer and closer but I&#39;m sticking with Garmin for now.', 'Having decided that both devices have their benefits… I think the more important question is how do you use the data to support your fitness journey and goals. What are you actually measuring? How do the measurements taken direct or improve the training regime you’re following? Having analysed the output from the device have you ever worked out that you need to more of this or less of that to meet your goals?', 'What about shoes for the pups', 'For me the epix 2 has been inaccurate in almost everything except hiking. Even the OHR is sluggish while spinning, takes forever to catch up with the peaks. So I kept it just for that, hiking. For everything else I use the ultra.']"

He uses garmin for exercise and cycling and apple for everything else. I bought an epix2 for myself and love it. But I agree, I hate the look of apple watch. There is no watch face I could find that made it look like garmin. BUT, it does few things better than garmin and for that reason, I might (just might) get one for daily wear.', 'I think your point is so important. I think a lot of people including myself look at the data and it just stresses them self. I found myself wondering if I drank enough water, if I slept well enough, if I should take a day off. It honestly made workouts and life less fun. I stopped looking at the data and found my love for workouts again.', 'You’ve mentioned it previously, though does the frothy mocha choco latte just make an appearance in the title of this video or will it become a permanent fixture?

I’m assuming it will easily deal with this even with GPS on, maps on etc?', 'I went from a Samsung Galaxy watch to the Fenix 6X pro solar and will never go back to a Samsung.  I am not an Apple fan of anything of theirs, so the Fenix is great.', 'I’m not willing to spend on multiple watches and don’t like notifications/phone on the wrist. I got the Fenix 7 DLC with the link strap and its perfect. Looks smart enough at any time I need it to and swap out the band for sport time. Not to mention the battery is good enough to not get annoying. That’s the thing with watch reviews and similar tech, it’s all preference and user requirement.', 'Umm, ya. 😅', 'I switched to Apple from Android four years ago for the Apple Watch. Last month I bought a used Fenix 6X Pro as I felt like I wasn’t advancing my training. I absolutely love the Fenix, used it nonstop for a month without my Apple Watch. As much as I love the Fenix I just cannot for the life of me get over the cellular capabilities of the Apple Watch. I’ve dug deep and researched apps that could replicate the Garmin experience and it’s not easy or cheap: Athlytic, Training Today and Tempo. And all require subscriptions but I’m dealing with it. I’m still perplexed and admit I loved Mark’s video a few months ago but now I’m tempted again haha. But I think I’m staying Apple Watch, but Garmin needs cellular functionality or Apple will just continue to erode their lead in premier sports tracking. Cheers', 'What brand of shirts r u repping? They look nice, kinda want one', 'I recently upgraded to Ultra, nope it hasn’t replaced my 6X pro that would be a crime 😉. I now get 3 days on a full charge (at the moment) on my ultra instead of just about 1 day like series 7 urgh..daily charging now a thing of the past 🥳.<br><br>Ultimately it’s my daily/short run- marathon testing that distance out at London Marathon/heart monitoring tool - the only reason I went back to apple was because of the more advanced heart features - got a dodgy heart (thanks mum lol), otherwise I’d still be wearing my Garmin 🙂<br><br>I don’t see any point in getting a Fenix 7X yet my 6X does everything I need 🙌🏻', 'Hello from the ice box as I do a session of breathworks before mulching on a avocado salad. ( Got the picture?) Apple Watches are what first Prius owners were to the eco friendly car brigade. Lost in their own sense of self worth. When Sir Jony Ivy left Apple, Apples passion for product innovation based on design also walked out the door, so don&#39;t hold your breath on apple turning it around.', 'Only reason I wear my garmin pretty much 24/7 is to get a better idea of my actual resting heart rate and zones (taking sleep, rest, activity, etc. into account)', '👌', 'Great video!!  I have both watches.  I was training for a half marathon and noticed the distance wasn’t accurate on the Apple.  I also really disliked Athlytic.  It was always way off for me.  Needless to say back to Garmin at least for the time being.  I love having all the info in one place.', '@Gustavo Go same thing I noticed.  I know the Garmin is accurate because I’ve worn it for multiple races and my wife has one.  Both are very accurate.', 'Another app to have the date in the same place?', 'Indeed. I wear both a Garmin Epix 2 connected to a Stryd foot 🦶 pod and apple 7 Series to compare data. Always the Apple series 7 is showing less distance than what I really did.', 'I just got distracted after seeing Nixon toying with the idea of running in the road to chase the postman, silly boy', 'I had the Epix 2 for two months and sent it back when the Ultra came out.  I hate the Garmins lack of integration, I hate how big it is.  It gets caught on long sleeve shirts, backpacks, and gloves.  I bang it against every doorway I walked through and definitely sucks to swim with because of its size.  Sure apples battery still sucks compared to Garmin and it could be more sporty in looks, but for my triathlons, 100-200 mile bike rides and 32 mile trail runs my Ultra works for me much better then Garmin.', 'Nixon doesn’t need one, that’s good enough for me!']"

Best of both worlds for you ie Gshock + Tracking.', 'I started out with a simple €20 sportswatch / timer. But calculating my running distance with a map app and calculating my speed / tempo with a calculator became a bit annoying. So i switched to the Garmin Forerunner 55. It does the job and i have all the info i need. And if i want people to be able to reach me i will take my phone with me. In the end i like the running to clear my mind and once in a while be competitive. Why would i need 27.000 complicated functions?', 'Not used an Apple watch, but had other smart watches and now use only the fenix6. Main reason, I have tiny wrists, and the battery life of small smart watches is terrible. Like not being confident it could finish tracking a 4 hour ride terrible. So the simpler Garmin sports watch is a win for me!', 'But the battery… apple always behind…', 'I don&#39;t wear a watch', 'as a professional watch changer I have stayed with garmin 7x for a while now. it ticks most boxes most days as you said.', 'Welcome back to the Garmin Empire young jedi', 'Garment needs to make an app with the stuff in it for Apple.

Superb watch.', 'Cockashitzu 😂', 'The ONLY reason I have an Apple watch is due to travel. When in a new area I can load a destination in Google maps and then put my phone in my pocket and start walking.The Google Maps Apple Watch app tells me when to turn, guiding me to whatever location I want, giving haptic feedback if I miss a turn or go in the wrong direction. No phone in hand checking the screen frequently as you walk around. It&#39;s a game changer if you travel a lot. There&#39;s no Google Maps nav on the Fenix/Forerunner&#39;s and the 3rd party Connect apps I tried were terrible.', 'Sounds like common sense to me. I have an Apple Watch 8 and a Garmin forerunner 245. I like the convenience of the Apple Watch so use that most of the time. But I still keep the Garmin for when I think the Garmin would be better. I had the Garmin first and it’s fantastic as a sports watch, but I found it a bit bulky to wear comfortably all of the time, and its smart functions are not that great. I would be happy with either if I just had one though, but as a choice I would choose the Apple.']"

Years ago as tech was coming of age, I had many friends, all a lot younger, from my running and tri-clubs, tell me I needed to get onboard with the tech if I was going to improve. I was considered super old school, I did begin racing as a cyclist back in the early 80&#39;s, because I said I don&#39;t need tech telling me essentially, the very same things you brought up here.

This mostly boils down to fitness tracking, durability, battery life. When I hike always have my phone, so there&#39;s zero reason to have an Apple Watch. I have the Enduro 2 and the battery life is top notch. There are legs of the hike that might be 4-5 days between resupply/town and not having to charge EVERY day is key.  However, as an iphone user, i really would like to use an Apple Watch if it could last 4-5 days of ALL DAY tracking between charges.', 'I recently made the switch from Garmin to Coros and I&#39;ve been pretty floored.

I absolutely see why someone might feel overwhelmed in todays data centric sports world. And I can see how a serious hobbyist might abandon these devices. But for beginners, let me just put a simple disclaimer here: This person is an above average athlete with more than a decade of experience and self-experimentation. A beginner or an amateur will benefit immensely from incorporating data in their training to get an objective feedback about their effort and state of recovery. Now I dont mean you HAVE to use these things. But if you can afford it, and are willing to use it as a self-learning tool, you can benefit from it immensely, as it teaches you a lot about effort in the moment and the change of recommended effort in a week-to-week basis.

After that, he told me that maybe a series 7 or 8 would be nice &#39;cause it have other useful stats and I was like, ok? then the doctor at the emergency room took my phone and did the exact same thing. After spent the night at the emergency room I asked them about the watch. They told me that they obviously double check everything with specialized machinery but the watch and phone give them an analysis of what was happening earlier that day and week and is a reaaaally good addition. Now, looking at the ultra, I&#39;m tempted because: battery, alarm, sound (because I&#39;m 70% deaf) and all the stuffs that the SE don&#39;t have. Now, is expensive, but having those stuffs make me feel a little less worried when I&#39;m outside, in other country or similar situations. I&#39;m not an extreme user as apple show in the videos but I think all the people with heart diseases love the watch and they could focus on that and have a lot of new potential users (old people, transplanted persons etc).']"

Comparing it with my Apple Watch 5 (which I replaced), I noticed the glass used for the bottom sensor is more pronounced, has more depth and roundness and literally digs into your wrist. This &quot;digging&quot; into my wrist was what was giving me the sore bone. This, and the discomfort when scrubbing the crown (as it was very abrasive to my skin touching it as the crown would push the watch down every time I would turn it). The crown is big, has sharp edges and pinches. The top surface also has a very edgy, sharp wall around it (for protection) but if you&#39;ve got the habit of swiping from the edge of the screen (as you would on older generations), your finger will swipe over the sharp edges and it&#39;s not a pleasant experience. The additional weight of the watch, the constant pinching, soreness, uncomfortable overall &quot;squareness&quot; as it sits tall on your wrist, leaning on one side was just too much to handle. Overall I gave up after 3 days and am returning it. I cannot imagine wearing this thing day in and day out, including while I sleep.<br><br>To put things into perspective, I&#39;m an avid runner, very active during the day, use the watch for sleep tracking, I don&#39;t have skinny wrists and have no other medical conditions or allergies. This was a dream watch replacement for me until it became obvious it isn&#39;t. From the pictures it feels the normal Apple Watch 8 also seems to have added an additional height to the bottom-sensor, which may result in similar discomfort (although I&#39;m not sure as the watch itself is lighter so it may be easier to wear all the time).', 'Hoping Casey reviews this.', 'It’s not just for ‘extreme’ athletes, alpinists and hikers.

Case in point: How many people complain that their cellphone doesn&#39;t last a month? No one. Why? Well that&#39;s unrealistic, and also because charging your phone isn&#39;t a big deal. Why is charging your watch suddenly a big deal? Not many real world reasons, it&#39;s just a feature that we&#39;re used not and not one we actually use.<br><br>First, I bet most fitness watch users don&#39;t go weeks without charging their watch. Secondly, it&#39;s not much of an inconvenience to charge Apple Watch once a day or once every couple of days unless you really want to track sleep, and even then when you wake up you can put it on the fast charger while you get ready for the next hour then throw it on for the rest of the day. Thirdly, one of the reasons why multi-week battery life is likely a big deal is because charging most other fitness watches is clumsy and not convenient. My Garmin Fenix 6X Pro Solar has a wonky proprietary charger and it&#39;s not very convenient to charge, so I rarely make the effort to charge it. My Apple Watch, on the other hand, is super easy to charge with it&#39;s magnetic wireless charger.<br><br>So I think this whole &quot;battery must last a month!&quot; is just a talking point rather than a feature that most fitness watch users actually use. And when they do, it&#39;s likely because charging isn&#39;t easy and intuitive. This requirement is like pixel peeping with pro cameras: Does it actually make a real world difference?

I was excited to hear Apple was making a watch that had diving capabilities…but after looking at all the specs for this I gotta say they missed the mark. For your “once a year” recreational diver it’s fine I guess, but for a professional it’s still under par.  Let me explain:<br><br>1. Yes it’s missing air integration, meaning I can’t see my tank pressure from the computer and that to me is the MOST BASIC function of current dive computers.<br>2. No depth gauge below 40 meters is no problem for Rex divers, but as a rebreather instructor, I want a dive computer that will go as deep as I plan, which could be 250ft.<br><br>3. Battery life is still sad. My Sherwater Teric can go for well over a week. Not a dealbreaker but still is a disappointment.<br><br>4. But for me the main concern I have is that it’s an app! Most dive computers that’s all they do, calculate important info to keep you safe.  But I’m trusting an app on a watch that wasn’t solely made for diving.  And to top it all off you have to pay a monthly subscription fee just to use the app!!! That’s just dumb.<br><br>I get that it’s a watch that does a lot! And im glad they are making an effort, but when it comes to my safety and access to info I think I’d stick to my Teric for now.

You can actually buy a smartwatch with a replaceable cell battery that lasts for an entire year but the catch is that the watch is a hybrid smartwatch, and hybrid smartwatches prioritise being a watch over being a smart device. Ironically the first ever smartphone that paired to a phone was actually a hybrid smartwatch; the Sony Ericsson MBW-100. This watch was a mechanical watch with an LED display at the bottom for notifications and music and had playback controls on the side, and incredibly there are still watches that follow similar principles. <br><br>The most modern ones I&#39;ve seen use E-ink displays as the watch face with hands that will move out of the way whenever you get a notification or navigate through certain menus and settings (one of the popular examples of a watch with this setup being Fossil&#39;s Hybrid HR watches). These however don&#39;t have replaceable batteries but do have rechargeable batteries that only need recharging once every 2 weeks.<br><br>But another type is a hybrid watch that has no display at all and will instead point to a number on the dial that you can assign to notifications relating to an app or a contact. Personally I&#39;ve not had a good experience with Fossil&#39;s versions of these watches (on Android I had syncing issues and on iOS it would only accept notifications from apps that Fossil had personally whitelisted...no idea why, especially since their Hybrid HR watches support all apps but that&#39;s how it is) but there are other companies that make these, including none other than Armani. These watches look like normal watches and don&#39;t use much power which is how they&#39;re able to keep going for an entire year or more.<br><br>But yeah, I haven&#39;t seen a single Hybrid that supports third party applications and sadly they&#39;re rather underrated as watches.

However, it did have a capacitive touch display in a time period when everyone was stuck using inferior resistive touch displays or simply not even having a touch display of any kind. <br><br>The development of the iOS is also full of examples like this, and that&#39;s why for many many years it was entirely valid to call it a crippled OS compared to Android.

No web browser anymore? Needing to disconnect the watch from the iphone even if you have a celluar model, if your iphone is trying to connect to a wifi network your not connected to. Because you cant disconnect from the phone, from the watch anymore. <br>I had a series 2 I never updated and it had web browser built in, I could play music from the watch, &amp; the keyboard app I used to messages was in the app store an worked. <br>Fast forward to OS 8 &amp; getting a better watch. Those features are gone? <br><br>I want apple to make there watch line more co-hesive with software. Why is a 2017 series 3 model being sold in 2022? It couldn’t at least be a 4? It would allow more longevity. The SE model should have more features for its price imo. &amp; the screen size of the SE shouldnt exclude it from a basic needed feature.

The features they keep taking are literally from the palm pre &amp; pixi. I remember wireless charging coming out. 2010 I had it then for 5 years an iphone I didnt have it. They make it and you dont get a wireless charger with it like the palm pre line? <br>Then all the new features like multitasking, open windows, etc all things a 2010 phone had. Its funny with the notch because palm did the same layout with wifi time and service on the top of the pixi to save room. So in some aspects I feel like my I-phone is turning into a palm phone lol.

I frequently fish saltwater in 80-100 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 10 hours. Do you think this watch will have issues with the sun/heat exposure and slight saltwater splash’s? Mainly asking in terms of adhesive and components withstanding the heat outdoors. Do you have any experience using this watch in extreme conditions?', '@PHOENIX Actually. No. The water temperature of a hot shower is no more than 50°C. Any more than that and you will scold your skin if you prolong it for more than a minute.

Usually 50m means it is just splash resistance because you have completely different forces while swimming.

A watch rated with 50m water resistance means it is splash resistant. So you can shower with it, you can do sport with it and you can go out in the rain with it. But to be save it is not adviced to go swimming or diving with the watch because moving your arms in 1m depth of water puts the watch under more waterpressure than just that 1m of stationary water depth. And you definitely shouldn’t dive 50m with the watch. There are many watches rated with 50m and you still can swim with them but you never know which watch you gonna destroy. I would say that most Apple watches will survive swimming but one shouldn’t be angry if the watch dies someday while swimming (especially when the watch is older already and the seals are not as safe as they were in the beginning).
