0,i believe the stainless steel model also have sapphire crystal display rather than glass not just the ultra,['display']
1,is the always on display really that useful or useless how often do you use it,['display']
2,7 wa a minor upgrade to 6 8 an even minor to 7 same cpu since 6 not even shrinked to 5nm still 7nm so no better battery display a little bit smaller but who care will stick to my 6,"['display', 'battery']"
3,how is a se for kid because it doe not have always on display wa everyone kid when they bought the series 3,['display']
4,when you guy get the new iphones please compare the 14 pro and 14 pro max thermal and performance cause some leaked benchmark point to a 17percent faster cpu while other to a barley faster one could it just be the a15 in the normal 14 that get barley above last year s phone i really need to know if their is any difference between the pro and pro max other than the battery and display size before getting one thanks,"['display', 'battery']"
5,what doe the screen brightness have to do with it looking toyish or not lol it will likely have an ambient light sensor which mean it will only reach 2000nits in the very brightest outdoor condition you do not want that thing blaring at 2000 nit very often not only will the pretty poor battery life be even poorer but the oled display will take a beating aswell brightness and oled is do not go well they degrade faster the brighter they go,"['display', 'ambient light sensor', 'battery']"
6,i have the series 5 and i feel like the current se would be fine for me i do not use the always on display,['display']
7,6 33 from my first day of using apple watch i set the display to list view style,['display']
8,the sapphire display on the apple watch ultra is not pure sapphire meaning it still scratch where regular gorilla glass would apple should not be claiming that it ha a sapphire display because of this,['display']
9,bro had the stickman display explanation backwards,['display']
10,i been debating on getting the ultra because i like the orange display at night and screen size and the orange band but i want to know what health feature it ha i have never had an apple watch the last thing is i feel like it would be too much tech i have an iphone 11 pro my second iphone ever and an ipod any suggestion for getting it,['display']
11,i have to say something i have been using apple watch 5 since it release the display ha cracked and crown wa gone over this time one fixed from pocket one fixed by apple if i had an ultra these will not be happen i am just a normal everyday user it is only 100euros difference between steel version of series 8 and ultra so if the design is ok there is no excuse for using apple watch series 8,['display']
12,absolutely love this watch best apple watch to date overall regardless of how you want to use it in my opinion visit a store that ha one on display and put your hand on it may not be for everyone but this watch will surely be an enormous hit especially during the christmas season,['display']
13,i decided to charge my ultra and run it till the battery wa dead i performed my normal use a few phone call texting daily work out and kept on normal power mode and always on display i got exactly 54 hour and 10 minute big improvement,"['display', 'battery']"
14,man doing any smartphone stuff on that display would be as and probably make your finger cramp up in about 30 second,['display']
15,just ordered my ultra because i currently have a series 7 small screen product red i originally got solely for working out to replace my series 3 big display but found myself hating it cause of the battery and the size wa not big enough to do anything with plus always thought the watched looked ugly regardless of the size and color and resembled a spy kid watch looking forward to the ultra and seeing if the battery life and big screen make it a good solution a far a the spy kid look i would not be wearing any apple watch to the met gala anytime soon put it that way,"['display', 'battery']"
16,i think it look like one of the first smartwatches like a mini smartphone strapped to the wrist i am an extreme sport person skydive basejump wingsuit dive freedive rock climbing etc and to me the biggest issue is the form factor entanglement and battery life there no way 2 day is enough my go to watch is a garmin descent g1 solar it look like a gshock is super durable ha gps is a full blown dive computer without subscription and ha week of battery life with solar recharging to me the apple watch ultra is like a porsche suv it for people who want to feel a if without actually needing the functionality a hiker can use the normal apple watch a runner a well a real diver not just 1 2 scuba dive occasionally per year would not trust this watch in the mountain and snow the cold will drain the battery even faster i also do not like the display bright sunlight and polarized sunglass will make it hard to read garmin us a technology where the watch becomes better readable the more sunlight reflects off the screen,"['display', 'battery']"
17,their strategy for this replacing ultra watch dive computer reminds me of how they targeted expensive color correction monitor with the pro display,['display']
18,i still think for hiking other outdoor activity and battery life the garmin fenix 7 7 7x is the way to go my fenix 7x with everything turned always on display except the 5 satellite my battery last 3 week if you turn every extra stuff off then the battery last 1 year if i have the 5 satellite turned on for hiking and other activity then the battery last 48 hour the garmin map and tracking are superior for hiking and ultra marathon most people do not know about the garmin fenix and epic watch you should check them out,"['display', 'battery']"
19,4m view but yet you fail to mention the ultra doe not have edge to edge display what a step backwards who care about a 49mm screen if the display is only 47mm with an unusable black bezel around the display how irresponsible of apple to fail to mention this going right back they are not getting my dollar800 to downgrade,['display']
20,love the new design of this new apple watch ultra however i think apple should also get a smaller size a displayed on the apple watch 8 so people with smaller wrist can also enjoy the funky design too,['display']
21,pro actually ha more of an elegant feel not a rugged feel okay perhaps not the pro display but everything else,['display']
22,imagine solar panel under the display that would be a game changer,['display']
23,did you have display on through your test,['display']
24,actually iwatch ultra is a watch for people who want to display status on their wrist people who do those extreme type of sport are better off with a watch that is specifically made for their type of activity and that is what you gon na see in the end like 90percent of people who will wear this watch will propably use it to check their message,['display']
25,i am just a regular user who need a resistant case to my job in an ambulance and like the design or the bigger display and more brightness from the ultra and i am not in your draw,['display']
26,unske the dual frequency gps is super useful for me with photography and i will leave my phone at home when i go out it also ha very good triangulation with the mics so no wind noise come in i also can take this watch skiing and have a big enough display for my huge hand the night display help with night photography it is great for me to each their own,['display']
27,impressive feature and beautiful display but miss the mark big clunky and mediocre battery life this ultramarathoner will stick with coros,"['display', 'battery']"
28,apple ha really upped their game with this watch i am impressed however i am an avid garmin fenix 7x user and previous 6x owner i know the ultra should be compared to the epix 2 based on battery life and screen but i opted for the bigger and better for longevity i think apple is on the right track if their goal is to keep gain even the extreme adventurer interested i must say i am really digging the look of this ultra and would love to see where they go with it there are some small feature on the ultra i wish would be on the fenix but it go both way even though the fenix 7x is a little overkill for my us it still brings an app that is a capable on android a it is on io it is not an amoled screen but it still touch capable and the reflective display is super readable in sunlight and add to the overall 28 day average batter life fenix 7x is a watch i know i can also make last 5 year minimum with feature that will be a strong then a they are now,"['display', 'battery']"
29,the best fitness tracker doe not even have a display all apple needed to do wa make the 8 slightly thicker for the battery charged 600 rather than 800 and called it a pro,"['display', 'battery']"
30,with the regular apple watch 8 or se could i get 2 day if i turn off always on display and use it lightly,['display']
31,this watch ha an absolutely enormous pull for me a an astronomer it ha a red filter for the display which is absolutely crucial for astronomy to protect night vision my current apple watch if i accidentally tilt my wrist kill my night vision however the biggest reason is the waypoint marker often u astronomer need to travel far and to remote location to find darker sky my closest dark sky area is beautiful but ha absolutely zero signal of any degree and can be pretty easy to get lost something like the waypoint marker if accurate and reliable would massively increase my confidence and enjoyment traveling to remote site and further my enjoyment of astronomy,"['display', 'display']"
32,is the display flippable so that the crown can be on the left for ppl who prefer to where the watch on right wrist,['display']
33,i just think it crazy apple sell a 60hz display phone for 900 buck in 2022,['display']
34,ha nobody here heard of the garmin epix it blow the apple watch out of the water except for one thing it is not in the apple ecosystem but still having owned both i sticked with the epix because of the 2 week battery life with always on display very accurate metric the button all the available information in widget and not almost everybody already wear a garmin epix unlike a apple watch,"['display', 'battery']"
35,i have been using a huawei watch gt2 for the last couple of year it doe not have all the function of android or apple but i get my notification and can answer or decline phonecalls and it also show the time but the battery life is just insane i get a full week with always on display last night when i came home around 5pm i had 13percent battery left i wa like eh i will charge it tomorrow night,"['display', 'battery']"
36,marque if you are wearing your watch on the right arm please rotate the display in setting so the crown is easier to access,['display']
37,what kind of car do you drive that ha that huge display,['display']
38,see viewer how apple fan boy aka digital slave justify that 800dollar when pixel 6a came with 60hz display this guy just criticize but now ip14 and again 800dollar iwatch these manipulator are the cancer of tech world,['display']
39,my apple watch series 3 just broke i bought the apple watch ultra do i scuba dive no do i do trialthalons no do i want a longer battery life bigger display and a cooler looking watch yes mine should arrive in two day excited,"['display', 'battery']"
40,speaking from an electrical engineering nerd perspective i just geek had to have it for the large display i am a big guy too so the large size will not bother me also being in my mid 40 is helping out my eyesight a well also big upgrade for me a i am still rocking a series 2 apple watch can not wait for my delivery,['display']
41,a someone who dive recreational it probably will not replace my dive computer yet i am excited to see the next generation on what it can possibly do though the current pro i see automatically log your dive if you do electronic dive log share your dive with everyone else perhaps give you more tangible feedback if you are ascending or descending too quickly like bigger vibration sometimes hearing the beep in the ocean is quite hard what i hope it can do in the future gps tracking of all of your dive buddy and group if they wear the ultra or some water proof airtag there were moment where i dove with only 1m of visibility so it can be hard to track anyone down there if they had a radar display or an arrow that point where your dive buddy is and how far that will be neat,['display']
42,2 full day with always on display on or off did not mention bro,['display']
43,1 on this i have had apple watch since the very first one and do not use any of the health or fitness feature at all so while i will happily take the extra battery life i do not really need it since i already finish the day with gt 50percent battery life however the ultra appeal to me because the display technically cover glass of my apple watch get so beat up and putting a screen protector on the curved glass look feel weird to me so i do not,"['display', 'battery']"
44,i tried the series 2 and series 5 both left me disappointed a fitness watch one of my complaint wa the button not enough button to be able to do thing during run and when sweat wa everywhere maybe 1 extra button plus the crown for scrolling will fix that the native exercise apps never impressed me and did not display the data i wanted or in the configuration i wanted i like the apple watch a a smart watch and fashion statement and always wanted it to work a both but now the ultra ha the sport capability and the look is not sleek and fashionable a the base model so it still doe not work for me i will keep my garmin i guess,['display']
45,my series 5 which i am replacing ha 88percent battery health and i have to charge more than once a day i have to run the display at max brightness to read it in all condition maybe it is because i am getting older and the eye are not all they once were but that also drain the battery more i figure the ultra will age much more gracefully for me extended battery life and brightness mean even a component degrade they will probably still be a good a the normal watch of course you get the extra stuff too though at 69 i will not be climbing everest or shooting the rapid but no one ha ever cursed extra durability or battery life i will probably wear it with a pedestrian apple leather link band and will enjoy the bigger display and the keyboard ever try to draw a password on a aw5 an exercise in frustration best to have your phone nearby so you can use it is keyboard,"['display', 'battery']"
46,i ordered one instantly on day one after the conference i may not need all it sport feature but i surely do want bigger display longest batter life ever and the brightest screen for outdoor use,['display']
47,please apple just give u a reflective transflective display quit trying to fight the sun with photon you are so close to practicality,['display']
48,the reason i am considering buying one of these flat screen curved screen are the worst thing to happen to mobile electronics because screen protector are inefficient and sometimes un doable if a fingerprint sensor is in the display samsung had to know about this before they introduced this plague onto the market but for some reason every engineer threw logic out of the window because they look cool or something it is the main reason i switched ecosystem no stupid curved screen or in screen fingerprint sensor imagine my frustration when i buy a series 7 apple watch and find my actual worst nightmare a flimsy curved screen that scratch if you look at it too often,['display']
49,if i am spending dollar800 on a smart watch it better have a battery way longer than 2 day i really hope hybrid screen with either e ink or layered segment display get some investment for this reason,"['display', 'battery']"
50,i hope they make an iphone ultra would love a flat display with a lip like that to make it rugged and not need an additional case,['display']
51,something some folk miss is that larger display mean easier for people with poor vision to read larger control mean easier to manipulate so if you are a larger older person this watch is more appealing than if you are a smaller or younger person before you even get to the other feature add being clumsy on top of it and yeah the ruggedness is nice too,['display']
52,i work outside with park and recreation a a groundskeeper and pre ordered this just for the ruggedness the flat display hopefully will keep dust and particle out of the bezel gap which is the main thing that drive me crazy about the regular apple watch a screen protector also never worked on the curved display a it would bubble up and peel after a couple of week i can not wait,['display']
53,sad part is that i really wanted a flat display i do not care about any of the other feaures just give me a flat glass screen like the iphones have the curved bezel make it impossible to use a screen protector my iphone 14 pro max ha flat glass my iphone 11 did not and the screen protector can go right against the edge that is all i need no curve no fat glass that is rounded off to give a depth 3d look this weighs more and is not needed apple should offer a watch 8 pro that follows the iphone pro design language,['display']
54,8 25 no i am not somebody who never owned a watch i just like the new form factor and especially the all flat display that is much better readable,['display']
55,please also review a garmin forerunner or enduro model to understand why ultra triathlon sporters use them a lot on the biking leg of a triathlon i really prefer to have my garmin bike computer edge 530 displaying bike gear power data heart rate cadence etc on a much bigger screen but much more important is garmin connect and the way it us all that data to give advice on training status readiness and many more data point if you want to use data to optimize your endurance activity a garmin is still the best choice for for casual endurance event finishing an ironman once to scratch it off a bucket list the apple watch ultra is sufficient,['display']
56,a an ultra runner and fan of apple product i have to say this watch doe not deliver what i find in a garmin or similar watch it would be a long list to compile my thought but two stick out the still lacking battery life not for one activity but over a full week of training and the lack of button there is so much muscle memory built into the way i use my garmin on the garmin i can go blindly to a specific data point while running i can not on a touch display or with the crown i still see this watch a a lifestyle item edit even more importantly this apple watch lack any recovery metric which is a major factor for judging training,"['display', 'battery']"
57,i do not need the ultra at all i have had the series 3 4 amp 6 all in stainless steel i am going to upgrade my series 6 to the ultra mainly because the series 8 is not much different to the 6 the cost difference is not a lot and i want a different design i will never use the diving hiking or mountain feature but doe that mean this watch is not for me i do not like how sometimes apple seems to suggest just because you will not use the feature the watch wa designed for that you should just get the se i want a bigger brighter screen i want a better battery same thing with the macbooks i am not a pro at all in any sense but i still prefer the macbook pro over the air and i usually want the 16inch pro just for the display quality and battery size my point is i always feel like i should not be buying these product or feel guilty for buying them just because they are not designed for my life case great video a always,"['display', 'battery']"
58,it is titanium ha a sapphire crystal display and an extra programmable button enough get on my wrist,['display']
59,maybe in future they will make a ultra iphone mkbhd it sound like that phone will be harder to brake i wish they make iphone ultra one some day and that can go 100 meter deep sapphire display it will be cool,['display']
60,i have a letsfit iw2 smartwatch it cost me 40 freedom unit shipped to my door doe everything a basic smartwatch need to do along with some custom display an app for android that work well the company is based out of fla i have had people who do not know ask if it is an apple watch and best of all the dang thing last nearly 10 day on a charge apple want 800 freedom unit for their watch and for what i need in a watch hell no,['display']
61,get a garmin watch it gps is awsome it is way way better than apple at golf with not a nice a display,['display']
62,i personally wish the regular watch did not have a curved display,['display']
63,my apple watch series 8 is coming today very excited i actually wanted the ultra but mostly for the battery life and the flat display but after thinking it over i just could not justify dollar800 for a watch that only had two feature i liked the rest of the feature i would probably never use it is a nice watch though it is also huge and i am a small female so it would probably be too big for my wrist apple please make a female version of the ultra,"['display', 'battery']"
64,i am actually surprise that this watch is compelling to me the gen 7 watch requires me to charge mid hike if i track my workout or else i risk loosing it also in the middle of the day heat in the desert i normally have to turn and place my watch in my shadow to see the screen lastly in 112 degree heat i found the watch overheated and would not display data i hope this ultra watch can stand up to the heat better the gps might be somewhat useful for navigating canyon where gps tends to get squirly but it not often you get lost in a canyon because there is normally only two direction to navigate,['display']
65,definitely overkill for me but i have a series 4 and had been wanting to update to a watch with always on display so i have an ultra on order people were expecting this pro watch to be over dollar1k which would have been an easy pas for me when it came in at dollar799 it made it appear a a bargain and motivated people to buy i think apple planted those gt dollar1k rumor,['display']
66,that is the same spot i am in i have a 4 which is still kicking but i would love an always on display,['display']
67,and they last for week longer than apple is watch ultra even in the ultra is 60 hour battery saving mode apple writes in the fine print of the product page that it turn off the heart rate and gps sensor just to make it last that long garmin ha both heart rate and gps going for at least 96 hour and multiple day longer if gps is turned off apple would have to change the display technology completely to be able to get it to last longer than 60 hour,"['display', 'battery']"
68,wonder how battery life and display match between samsung watch 5 pro and apple watch 8 ultra naming scheme go burrr,"['display', 'battery']"
69,funny how smartwatch battery is so important but no one talk about the amazfit smsrtwatches charged my gts 3 friday with always on display and notification on today is wednesday and i am still at 47percent,"['display', 'battery']"
70,review keep saying this is designed for the extreme user marcus briefly touched on who will truly buy this watch those people who simply want a better apple watch period who doe not want 2 3 day battery life who would not love a brighter display so it is big so what i am a bigger guy and this probably will not look too out of place on me this watch will sell ton and ton for every 1 person that buy it because they are an ultra marathoner or scuba diver they will sell 99 to an average person who will never use 99percent of the ultra feature i would not be surprised if in 2 or 3 year this rugged version becomes the normal version we could see a smaller 44 or 45 mm version for smaller wrist etc stop trying to convince average user that they should buy the se because it is all they will ever need the fact appears to be that the ultra is a good watch better in every way and that is why they will sell million,"['display', 'battery']"
71,nice review now i have to wait till november to get mine that flat display tho velcro strap are the way to go all my casios have velcro and this one will too by 3rd gen this watch will be solar thanks,['display']
72,2 day and night with always on display or without,['display']
73,apple can make regular apple watch with bigger battery and flat display but they will not because all they want is your hard earned money,"['display', 'battery']"
74,were you also using always on display when you got 2 5 day out of it thanks,['display']
75,this is way smaller and cheaper than my garmin watch i love the way it look and although my garmin epix 2 with oled display can last a full week even with heavy use i really like the look of this watch and the fact that it will complement the rest of the apple ecosystem,['display']
76,i think the apple watch will be a compulsary electronic device in the near future think about these apple glass will be released in 5 year and it is gon na be substitute phone but by the apple glass it can not take a selfie if apple watch have under display camera people can take a selfie by apple watch the size will be bigger than current watch series because battery and physical limitation just a the iphone series wa initially adapted to being larger than 4 inch to 6 inch it will also adapt to the larger watch apple glass itself may not be able to completely replace the phone but i think it will be possible to completely replace it with the help of the apple watch starting with the apple watch ultra more and more function are introduced and i am sure that the apple watch will invade the iphone is territory it is expected that apple glass will be used to consume content such a video viewing social medium and game and the apple watch will be a way to compensate for the shortcoming caused by the physical limitation of glass maybe my expectation are wrong and all function can be integrated with just one apple glass,"['display', 'battery']"
77,i think the watch ultra 2 may have the promotion display,['display']
78,i prefer the ultra naming scheme pro professional you do not need to be a professional to use the added feature of the airpods pro or the iphone pro whereas the pro xdr display and pro mac option are built for professional use i think apple should migrate consumer level high end product line to the ultra moniker ultra sound premium and will draw enthusiast without muddying the definition of the word pro,['display']
79,ugly watch i prefer a basic casio digital watch it ha an always on display and a 10 year battery even ha a backlight and best of all it tell the time whenever without pressing button,"['display', 'battery']"
80,smartwatches sadly still have some degree of compromise you can actually buy a smartwatch with a replaceable cell battery that last for an entire year but the catch is that the watch is a hybrid smartwatch and hybrid smartwatches prioritise being a watch over being a smart device ironically the first ever smartphone that paired to a phone wa actually a hybrid smartwatch the sony ericsson mbw 100 this watch wa a mechanical watch with an led display at the bottom for notification and music and had playback control on the side and incredibly there are still watch that follow similar principle the most modern one i have seen use e ink display a the watch face with hand that will move out of the way whenever you get a notification or navigate through certain menu and setting one of the popular example of a watch with this setup being fossil is hybrid hr watch these however do not have replaceable battery but do have rechargeable battery that only need recharging once every 2 week but another type is a hybrid watch that ha no display at all and will instead point to a number on the dial that you can assign to notification relating to an app or a contact personally i have not had a good experience with fossil is version of these watch on android i had syncing issue and on io it would only accept notification from apps that fossil had personally whitelisted no idea why especially since their hybrid hr watch support all apps but that is how it is but there are other company that make these including none other than armani these watch look like normal watch and do not use much power which is how they are able to keep going for an entire year or more but yeah i have not seen a single hybrid that support third party application and sadly they are rather underrated a watch sure they are more minimalist when it get to functionality but they do have a kind of secret agent spy watch kind of quality to them that i think make them stand out,"['display', 'battery']"
81,i know they are not in the same market bracket but a a long time amazfit user it make me chuckle when people are shocked they get more than a day out of their watch i still have basically all feature 98percent of anyone buying this will ever use but charging more than once a week is not a thing even with always on display active i can not fathom why people accept le than a day battery on stuff,"['display', 'battery']"
82,galaxy watch 4 baby i do construction and it is amazing i get 2 day on it always on display google ect 800bucks is way too much,['display']
83,would not the theater mode have affected battery life since it would not turn on the display when you raise your watch until you touch it,"['display', 'battery']"
84,so i could see many ordinary apple watch user with a normal or larger wrist who would have gotten the stainless steel 45mm apple watch that also ha a sapphire crystal get this instead which get them an even larger display much better battery life the extra button and louder speaker and even more rugged for close to the same price in fact the series 7 45mm stainless steel with the milanese loop wa also dollar799 great in depth review mkbhd a always,"['display', 'speaker', 'battery']"
85,what if someone who isnt a avid hiker or anything like that want this watch just cause it a bigger display and battery life i have a bigger wrist so the ultra would look normal on me,"['display', 'battery']"
86,frankly i just got myself a huawei gt3 pro last me 12 day or so if i do not put always on display and i can do everything the new apple ultra watch can do and it is only 300 usd and there r decent discount in u a e where i live n work the only pain point is loading it i sincerely suggest that u check it out,['display']
87,total overkill for the vast majority of smart watch user a you say but people will buy it in their drove to have the latest and greatest and justify it with the added durability battery life and the display etc which is fine but when it come to the cost it is gbp70 more than the stainless steel series 8 gbp6 month on interest free credit over 12 month and the added functionality make it a much easier choice your money spend it how you want,"['display', 'battery']"
88,to me this doe not get me there i bought an garmin epix 2 this year which is a fenix with that nice oled screen instead of that bland battery saving display that sacrifice some battery but still i get 14 day on that thing with at least an hour of activity every day and with display always on i still get a week sure this doe not have the superb smartwatch feature that apple watch have but the garmin watch are league ahead in activity feature seems to me that if you are into the hole ultra aspect big hike long run and diving the garmin feature set should be so much more appealing especially combined with the battery would love to here a counter point to this,"['display', 'battery']"
89,the apple watch ultra is essentially killing the very high end gadget the same way that the pro display xdr did,['display']
90,can you try golf apps i am curious a to the display offering with the ultra watch and determine if it worth getting over a garmin watch,['display']
91,always on display is not a feature for a niche audience on a watch a much a i like apple is implementation of the display that turn on only when you flick your wrist it is not a nice way to check time at a glance once you start having it there is no going back to the old technology it is also much nicer when you are talking to someone to be able to glance in a discreet way without making it look like you are bored or in a hurry to stop the conversation,['display']
92,there is one more class of people the one who want the latest and greatest from apple they are not pro in the normal sense of the word but they need top of the line device because of just who they are and the fact that they have money to spare it those people who buy the pro display xdr stand or the mac pro wheel those who buy macbook pro just to run gmail on it i think this group is going to be the majority even more than the extreme athlete,['display']
93,is not the surrounding bezel huge in display coverage it like series 7 going back to series5 and 2years down the time we have slightly larger display in the same form factor how doe california apple watch face look on ultra,['display']
94,take away all the gimmick that your normal average person doe not do consistently like diving and hiking just add in the big battery and better display but lower the price and this would be worth it other than that it is really overpriced like many of apple product usually are,"['display', 'battery']"
95,dollar800 no nada not worth it at all let is do an actual breakdown of actual usefulness of any other feature other than telling time for an item that just mostly sits there and display a time most use their similarly priced phone it is a huge waste of money i put this in the same category a owning a fancy rolex that doe the exact same thing a a citizen,['display']
96,i switched to a garmin fenix series because i got tired of charging the apple watch every night the day when you forget to charge or do not have access to a charger mean you have a one day watch the fenix ha a 3 week battery with basic function but the screen display is not a nice maybe this watch would be nice if it had a lower battery mode to stretch it out to a week or so,"['display', 'battery']"
97,one niche segment that is likely bigger than any of the sport oriented one you and apple have mentioned is the large watch wearer there are million of people that simply found all other apple watch too small period nothing else this watch is for them next you have people like me the new styling is one of the strongest selling point flat display being key i could have done with 46mm but it is the style nonetheless and of course the obvious battery life watch ultra is going to sell like crazy if initial availability condition are any indicator,"['display', 'battery']"
98,one aspect of the apple watch ultra that i think is getting under reported is the change to the screen a flat screen protected by a titanium lip is going to be a lot harder to scratch than the rounded display of the past i have owned four apple watch the series 1 2 4 and 6 even with the sapphire glass every one of them ha been nicked and scratched over the course of normal were now i am a mechanic that always forgets to take his watch off when he is digging in an engine but even reducing that amount of screen damage over time is almost reason enough to buy the ultra at least in my estimation i think that people who do a lot of manual labor will dig the update and see it a a legitimate reason to upgrade,['display']
99,so when it come to the ultra v garmin just an example battery life there are a couple of other thing that help garmin achieve that long battery charge like the screen are very different lcd v a basic transflective display the power need between the two are the far end of the spectrum the new garmin epix 2 only go maybe a few day with normal use apple make a much better everyday smartwatch over garmin disclosure i have a series 7 and a fenix 6 over garmin while i have not tried any of the new touchscreen garmin is however they both have their place i prefer the apple watch right now and have my fenix for when i play golf or go for any hiking i have yet to have tried the new watchos 9 for hiking on the apple watch so i can not compare yet,"['display', 'battery']"

104,this is not a watch for professional athlete this is more like for people who want a stronger watch for weekd hiking or for occasional shorter running and they like the apple watch i think it would be really good for diver but other sport im not sure cycling nope it is not possible to connect any plugins rear radar watt meter or display ultra runner trail runner how they say nope if someone is running longer than according to apple 17 hour he will be out of battery thru hiker i do not think so 300 500mah of battery you need every evening if you are out in mountain for 1 2 week you do not want to spare energy on watch or take second power bank just for watch i wished that aw ultra will be suitable for athlete and put a proper battery and connectivity in to it but no maybe 2 or 3 gen will be better make it 30 hour on battery with gps add connectivity and i will pay anything,"['display', 'battery']"
105,keaton anderson there are mechanical watch that run for year on end there are also sport watch with display that run for month and there are sport smartwatches like the garmin epix 2 that have week of battery life whilst also having vastly more feature than the ultra and p it doe not look like a brick apple is not there yet especially for actual sport us,"['display', 'battery']"

110,id say the biggest improvement to the ultra can be the actual transferring of many more apps from your iphone to your watch so you can essentially justify the hefty price tag by being able to have somewhat of a portable cell phone on your wrist i got the ultra a my first apple watch ever because of the screen size although i like the 49mm display i know a lot of people will disagree with me here lol but i would love a 53 mm display for the screen size also again allow u to bring apps for the apple watch such a offerup snapchat facebook twitter instagram waze gps amazon ebay etc,['display']
111,i would be interested in new case material such a cobalt chromium which would be more scratch resistant and providing a more premium finish also perhaps we will see an intermediate model between the ultra and non ultra model such a a pro model that ha an action button but not a recessed display i suspect the temperature sensor feature will be improved and used for improved sleep tracking,['display']

117,i wa in the apple store today and the watch can not be setup without an iphone which mean the apple watch is distinctly an iphone peripheral which i think is a bad design choice especially for modern time when an tablet device can do everything a phone can an more for instance i can call people using facebook messenger which begs serious question of using a mobile phone service provider but that is another topic consider that the ipod mini ha a display and a designer made an app and case that allowed it to be used a a stand alone watch many should feel uneasy having to own an iphone to use the watch most smart watch distinctly can independently be used a a watch and computing device you can download apps onto and then also take advantage of the feature that allow it to be used a a smart phone peripheral,['display']

125,mata toto i have noticed that it is a very apple thing to do to release an amazing product that catch everyone is attention however upon critical view you will notice that in many regard it is still an inferior product compared everything else that is on the market one of the best example of this strategy is the iphone 1 it ha not 3g while everyone else already had it at the time it can not sent mm message while everyone at the time had been doing that for year already however it did have a capacitive touch display in a time period when everyone wa stuck using inferior resistive touch display or simply not even having a touch display of any kind the development of the io is also full of example like this and that is why for many many year it wa entirely valid to call it a crippled o compared to android nowadays apple ha finally caught up with a lot of that technical debt but it is still pretty sad how many absolutely crucial basic feature came several year late,['display']

154,"Watch came with display screen not flush with the rest of the watch, within days it had air bubbles forming under the screen. I went ahead and returned it and about a week and a half after receiving it thinking I would get a refund. They only refunded me $63 of the $242 that I paid. Upon further investigation they charged me for $179 for them to fix the watch to be able to sell it to the next person. Worst Amazon experience I’ve ever had.",['display']

156,"After switching back over to an iPhone, I decided to give the Apple Watch SE 2 a try since it was on sale for Black Friday. I didn't think there would be much use for it other than the fitness tracker but I was pleasantly surprised. The fitness tracking is great but I am highly suspicious of the estimated calories burned when tracking traditional weight training. Having Apple Pay on your wrist is really convenient and the walkie-talkie function is super cool. I also like how you can answer phone calls from your wrist in case your phone isn't on you at the time. I am terrible about charging my devices so I wish the battery life was better but you can get through a solid day and a half if you aren't fiddling with the watch too much. If you don't care about having an always on display and are a dude like me that doesn't need a thermometer for menstruation tracking, get this one and save a bunch of money.","['display', 'battery']"
157,"If you are having trouble pairing this to your iPhone please read the following review. First you must have an iPhone 8 or newer model. Second, and most importantly, you must be running iOS 16 or greater. I got this watch a few days ago and I could not wait to pair it with my iPhone 13.It would pair then unpair and over and over again. I tried to manually pair it, I reset my phone, the watch, my network settings (all of these tips were found online) but none of them mentioned needing the latest iOS. My phone updates automatically so I assumed I was on the latest iOS. I was not.It took me about 45 minutes for the phone and watch to update and finally pair.This watch is good but not great. The battery life is just not there yet. If you want to wear this watch for the fitness aspect of it and track your sleep data as well as have it as a shortcut to read messages and see notifications throughout the day it doesn’t give you much time during the day or night to charge it. I did all the battery saving tips and it was still only good for about a day and a half. Kinda like my phone. And it gets worse if you want full functionality.I also wanted to use this with my Arccos golf tracking system but the battery really goes quick using gps for an entire round of golf and it does not give you anything more than a very plain numeric only display with basic yardages. It was very comfortable to wear and it does have very cool customizable watch faces but the poor battery life was a deal breaker. Sorry but it’s heading back.","['display', 'battery']"
158,"I purchased this in November for my birthday and so far like it a lot. I have no trouble with the battery life, it lasts a long time.

I’m pleased with the functions of this watch and would buy again. It does motivate me to exercise more.","['display', 'battery']"
159,"The Apple Watch SE is great, considering it can do most of the things the higher tier watches (like the Series 7 & 8) can do for this price, especially when you consider that this watch has almost the same specs as the Series 8.

In other words, if those features don’t matter that much to you, this could be your best choice for your wallet.",['display']

There is also a problem with the screen display internally making the screen look wonky at times. Not worth it. Get the real one not this.",['display']
161,"I had a series 2 Apple Watch and its battery was not holding a charge anymore.  The model 2 watch is no longer software upgradeable and the cost to change the battery in it did not seem to be the smart move with all that has changed in the watch.  I love the new brighter display and the ""constant on"" feature of the display.  The battery is still at 50% at the end of the day when I place it on the charging puck, so the battery life is great in spite of the constant on display.  I still use pretty much the same apps as I did before so the upgrade was not for the apps but for the battery and display.  Now if Apple only included real time glucose monitoring for diabetics, that would be nirvana and the rating would likely be 5 stars.","['display', 'battery']"
162,"I thought the original Apple Watches were great, and then felt like they were just fine tuning previous versions and calling it something new for each series.

The watch is also water-resistant, making it the perfect companion for my swim workouts.Overall, I would highly recommend the Apple Watch Series 8 to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile smartwatch that can keep up with their active lifestyle. It has quickly become an indispensable part of my daily routine.",['display']
164,"Love the watch, it does everything I need it to do and more. Sleep tracking is excellent, heart rate monitor and blood oxygen sensor are very useful. The alarm hasn’t failed me yet.The downside? Having all of those features constantly monitoring for changes drains the battery quicker than I’d like. Note that I dimmed the brightness of the display and turned off the “always on” feature. It helped a bit but to get the most out of the battery, you’ll have to turn off the active monitoring features.Low power mode is always an option if you’re really needing to conserve battery but it turns off 99 percent of features to do this.I have a charger nearby 95 percent of the time so that minimizes the issue somewhat.I‘d give it a half star back if that was an option (so realistically a 4.5 out of 5)Some people will say get the Ultra if you need a better battery, but I couldn’t justify $800.","['display', 'battery']"

186,"UPGRADES from Series 7:S8 Chip:  This is basically the same as the S7 chip, with a few new integrated sensors:--Temperature Sensors:  Measures wrist temp. only while sleeping, takes five days to build baseline.  Currently only used to help retroactively analyze ovulation cycles after two cycles.  Not predictive.--High G accelerometer and improved gyroscope:  Able to detect car crashes and call for help.  (Same feature available in iPhone 14)-Different Color options: (Currently no blue or green?)That’s it.  Everything else is exactly the same as the Series 7.  The only way I can even tell them apart is by the color, otherwise they look the same.  The only benefits to upgrading to a Series 8 from a Series 7 would be the improved ovulation tracking features via nighttime wrist temperature, (though Apple warns that this is not necessarily predictive and should only be used to retroactively analyze your cycles after a couple months of use, and you would have to be wearing it at night often because this feature only uses sleep temp data), or the car-crash detection (but if you are going to get an iPhone 14, then this feature will be in your phone already).  So, if you are not interested in the ovulation data (or just don’t want to wear the watch every night- because maybe you charge it at night), and you plan to get an iPhone 14, then there is no reason to upgrade to this Series 8 at all.  The series 8 does come with Watch OS 9 which has some new software features, but all Apple Watches Series 4 or later can upgrade to this same OS 9.  (So that is Series 4, 5, 6, and 7, and SE, all support upgrading to Watch OS 9)So basically, it is hard to recommend getting this Watch Series 8.  If you can live without the wrist temp ovulation analysis and car crash detection in the watch, then I would suggest sticking with Series 7.  Even Series 6 isn’t that different in terms of performance, it and will still support Watch OS 9.  If you are buying your first Apple Watch, I would still suggest getting the less expensive Series 7.  Or you could also look into the new SE 2, which is about $150 less expensive than this Series 8, but lacks several other features like the Always-On-Display, ECG, blood oxygen and IP6X rating.","['accelerometer', 'gyroscope']"

194,the casio garmin are more for the adventurer id say like the hard core diver and hiker apple samsung are trying to get into the game and not a bad start but battery life a you mentioned the casio with solar or like say the garmin felix or epic 2 will be much better id say too due to the lack of mic or speaker and losing some of the smart feature from iwatch gw 5pro,"['speaker', 'battery']"
195,play music on it thanks if it ha speaker a well,['speaker']
196,problem with apple watch is it need an iphone for over 80percent of the apps plus a apple is music based not having the speaker on the watch to listen to music on the go without a bluetooth headset make the watch sort of useless,['speaker']
197,battery life durability increased water resistance a some apple watch have failed on contact with moisture seen a few at the apple store upgraded mics and speaker a taking call on watch only can be a challenge the ultra is absolutely welcomed i am still just going to change my ss6 battery and ride until a health sensor get released that i will benefit from looking forward to hydration tracking blood pressure or blood glucose monitoring apple should read the depth gauge in diagnostics to determine if someone went beyond 100m for warranty coverage not covering water damage is perplexing and eu customer protection law with 2 and three year warranty put ours to shame those other watch do not run a full operating system so battery life on the apple watch will always be worse i can not graft on smart watch feature but i can charge so apple watch all the way,"['speaker', 'battery']"
198,i am older are the speaker noticeably louder on call my wrist are not huge so i am going to try it on in the store on the 23rd i kind of wish the regular series 8 with the sapphire screen wa actually a little cheaper than the ultra pretty much the same price i am on a series 4 with the sapphire screen and it never scratched so i have been pleased i hope i waited long enough for the upgrade to be significan not since i buy a lot in the apple ecosystem i have moved out of the yearly upgrade to every 3 or 4 year because apple slow roll the new feature,['speaker']
199,holy smoke the production quality the audio intro is so good and optimized i have dolby atmos speaker and the right left audio switch wa soo cool,['speaker']
200,i definitely do not dive run marathon or hike but that larger screen longer battery life extra button speaker and microphone wa a no brainier upgrade from my series 4 and with it only being gbp20 difference from a stainless steel series 8 it wa not a hard decision,"['speaker', 'microphone', 'battery']"
201,funny thing i bought the apple watch ultra a a father i want to prevent scratch on the playground louder speaker are needed and the action button is very welcome and when i pas my apple watch to a family member the battery life is quite a problem with a bigger battery you have a higher percentage of a higher capacity battery left great the icing on the cake is a better gps location when geocaching in forest nothing ultra but ultra great to me,"['speaker', 'battery']"
202,how about u who just wan na listen to music through the apple watch speaker is it a feature yet,['speaker']
203,ultra the size of the face screen the backtrack functionality never get lost the extra mic gps speaker of course the battery to run it all most people would very much appreciate these added feature even if they are not triathletes or outdoor adventurer it also will take on a fashion statement of it own there are many video showing tiny lady guy with small wrist like you and the watch visually look like it fit normally on the wrist looking forward to jumping from my old series 3 to the ultra i say for improvement to the ultra make it even bigger with a little solar panel to the left and to the right hey you got a whole arm ya know,"['speaker', 'battery']"
204,i like making and receiving phone call from my watch so better speaker are a selling point for me,['speaker']
205,when when when is apple going to allow me to play music with my watch with the sound coming out of my watch dollar800 and i can not even play music and the sound come straight out of my watch speaker i am a runner so this would benefit me,['speaker']
206,you did not even review the extra microphone and speaker for call quality you are slipping dude,"['speaker', 'microphone']"
207,i would love to have this watch but the only thing i do not like about it is that the speaker start getting crackly and sometimes i can not hear the person i am talking to i surf everyday with my apple watch and put it on surf mode which put it in water mode i am not sure if it is the salt water but i try to soak it in freshwater after i surf my apple watch 7 work fine but the speaker totally suck because maybe from the salt water of the pacific ocean i am not sure i would love to get this watch especially because the battery life when i use my apple watch which ha lte the battery percentage go down pretty fast when i am surfing i surf about two hour a day i just want to see if you can test that mkbhd see if you can test soaking the watch for a couple hour in fresh or even salt water and seeing if this speaker work good if so i would love to get this watch for the battery life and for the sport i do thanks mkbhd,"['speaker', 'battery']"
208,i do a lot of outdoor work a i am a property manager and the ruggedness of the screen and body are appealing to me plus larger battery will help me in the sense that i am not charging or discharging it a much a a regular apple watch battery therefore prolonging the overall battery lifespan longer than a typical apple watch with a smaller battery that get cycled more often throughout it life the louder speaker is also going to be something i am looking forward to a the current speaker is not quite loud enough in certain situation outdoors,"['speaker', 'battery']"
209,i am not a native english speaker and i am curious around 3 32 marque say button that do not have quite a much travel what doe he mean by to have travel in this case,['speaker']
210,i feel like marque channel would be one that is in a great position to create multilingual content like mr beast i do not speak spanish but i am sure there are million of spanish speaker who would love to hear what he ha to say,['speaker']
211,by learning spanish you have gain a spanish speaker follower,['speaker']
212,how quaint except for fall detection coming out later 2022 for wearos i see nothing special or new about these feature you might a well had done a video about all smartwatches google wallet came out 3 year before apple pay and i read using it then it showed up on watch with nfc like my old square sony smartwatch 3 in 2014 you can not even watch youtube or control your entire house and broadcast over ask speaker like you can with google assistant on an apple watch status symbol no see a status symbol is a designer like the one you get from wear o like louis vuitton offering a few version of the tambour horizon armani tag heuer movado kate spade fossil i am amused by isheep user they get so happy when they finally get something everyone else ha had for year like did not you just get a keyboard on the apple watch with swype finally back then i do not even know because if it wa that hunt and peck your letter one by one stuff i would go mad y all are so cute bless your catching up heart,['speaker']
213,i got the series 6 in 44mm and just got the 7 41mm i like to call n speak on my watch the series 7 watch speaker is rubbish compare to the 6,['speaker']
214,jon kc no i do mean hearing it work a a mini bluetooth speaker for my phone,['speaker']
215,jon kc yeah many of these cheap watch can be used a speaker for your phone i had one and the speaket could be used to take call and watch video,['speaker']
216,loved this review man the speaker difference is insane,['speaker']
217,speaker of this ultra watch is fantastic just make my samsung galaxy watch 5 pro speaker like rubbish,['speaker']
218,agree the speaker on apple watch ultra is significan notly better,['speaker']
219,Seller sold me a defective items and trying to charged me a restocking fee to hold 90% of my refund. Watch speaker doesn’t work. People can hear you but you can’t hear them.Becareful with this scammer,['speaker']
220,i have been have trouble with the microphone on my new apple watch anyone know what to do,['microphone']
221,awful trend with those oversensitive microphone mouth unsticking inhales licking lip etc sound disgusting,['microphone']
222,really happy with my series 8 especially appreciate your great video but what i do not seem to get any info on is the phone the first time i had no problem i could hear the caller and they could hear me yet recently i can just make out who wa calling therefore i do not answer with my watch because like an idiot i would be tapping the microphone on and off etc to no avail so my question is how am i able to hear the caller they heard me just fine since i have not been able to since that first time i am going to feel really silly if it is just a matter of turning the crown,['microphone']
223,apple watch have pretty robust body but the battery life are very short compared to android smartphones so apple watch engineer ought to consider it and must improve lot longer battery life other wise apple watch sell might fall dramatically,['battery']
224,i recently purchased the ultra watch and just love it battery is amazing and screen size is nice to interact with apps definitely would recommend,['battery']
225,i had a couple thing about the ultra that made me decide against buying it the biggest issue wa it is large to fit comfortably on my wrist and the watch can be a bit heavy the thing also wa the ultra wa hard to put under my long sleeve shirt i have smaller then normal hand and wrist for a man and the ultra wa just to large heavy and awkward for me being that i am retired and wanted an apple watch to monitor my heart and temperature reading i went to the series 8 41 mm i do not need cellular connection on the watch a i have my phone with me all the time i just could not justify spending another dollar120 00 a year added to my cellular plan and having a extra dollar100 00 for the watch the ultra is just not what i wanted and the se just wa not enough i also do not really have a use for the stainless model so i went with the aluminum the way to save money is also fish for the discount and by a short fishing trip over to the apple veteran and military website i found 10percent off on the site so that dollar400 00 watch wa dollar360 00 the ultra is just to much and the se not enough and the series 8 wa just right my pervious apple watch wa the original version that lasted until last month before the battery died so this wa a nice update,['battery']
226,i am not a smart watch person just shopping for mom what throw me off is why they have been using the same chip for so long if the battery last le than a day,['battery']
227,nice review i do disagree that the ultra is the best value ultra ha 2x battery 2x screen brightness 2x water resistance basically twice a good a the se in almost every way yet almost 3x the price plus there is definitely a market for people who would want the ultra but do not like the huge size if apple make the ultra in a smaller size and cheaper that would be a home run imo,['battery']
228,to be honest i just want a series 7 with the battery life of a ultra,['battery']
229,i am still using the series 4 but that ultra doe look nice update got the ultra and it is pretty cool but the battery dy significan notly faster while using cellular,['battery']
230,i just upgraded to an apple watch series 8 from my series 6 and i got ta say the battery life seems much better i wore it from 3am to 10pm and had 54percent charge remaining and that is not on battery saver mode,['battery']
231,apple tell you the ultra is for exploring in the middle of nowhere how do you do that with 38 hour of battery at most my garmin give me over 12 day in normal mode to me it is absurd,['battery']
232,did you make a mistake at 3 32 battery size of watch 8 45mm only 3 4 of watch 7 45mm,['battery']
233,lol i have the same issue i prefer the 8 stainless steel but it is almost the same price a the ultra which ha twice a battery,['battery']
234,the ultra cost 1000euros in europe battery last hardly a day that s insane shame on you tim cock,['battery']
235,dan r i just made another a test for battery using the wayfinder face switching it to dark mode only and it lasted 3 day without the need to use low power mode,['battery']
236,ultra too expensive and watch 8 too little battery life if watch 8 had 36 hr battery life with full use i could get that,['battery']
237,best bang for the buck because of the battery life hahaha what a joker,['battery']
238,lol i don really think much people will buy the ultra it is so damm expensive and there are many competition out like especially garmin which the battery life are measured in month,['battery']
239,apple usually underestimate it watch battery life so hitting 48 doe not sound too difficult for it plus energy saving mode is still available,['battery']
240,18 hour the galaxy watch 5 get 50 why can not apple improve the battery life,['battery']
241,i finally upgraded my series 5 and got lucky with a series 7 for 220dollar picked up locally it wa also sealed so i have been using it for a couple day and the bigger screen 2 day of battery life have been amazing,['battery']
242,so the ultra ha overkill feature for extreme sport without the battery life to go along bummer it seems it is gon na end up being a super premium watch for people willing to pay twice the price for another day of battery,['battery']
243,so i ended up with an ultra very happy i did the battery life is worth it alone,['battery']
244,massive 36 hour battery life bruh,['battery']
245,do the cellular model use the same modem a the iphone 14 is i am curious when apple switch to their own modem design if battery life will increase,['battery']
246,i like the extra battery and brightness of ultra i like feel and look of stainless steel so confused,['battery']
247,please get a samsung and be happy pathetic battery life is a no brainer,['battery']
248,not wrong at all the series 8 is a minimal upgrade could not even up the battery life from an abysmal 18 hour,['battery']
249,just bought this big as watch for no reason i love it btw it is huge and the battery is great you can definitely suffice with the series 8 for way le money but again i love it only thing i do not like is that the silver screen is very annoying i think the black would be a better option,['battery']
250,bruh the battery thing is just stupid my 100 dollar oppo watch free last a full 4 night till the 5th day with extensive training sleep monitoring etc so that is another apple style yesterday is tech at tomorrow is price,['battery']
251,the extended battery is one of the few thing that i actually like about this device it is overrated and overpriced the hand washing feature doe not work most of the time i want a smaller watch with a better battery and blood glucose monitoring,['battery']
252,however the design the fact that i am forced to use an iphone to use this watch and i love my solar garmin hard to think 2 day of battery a good when my solar garmin fenix 7 sapphire for about the sa e price last month or so ha one app that cover all and phone not limited can even pair to an iphone also it is basically ugly,['battery']
253,great tutorial however800 dollardollardollar fir what i can get for about 165 dollardollar by buying the amazfit gts 4 same feature and battery life is phenomenal i can charge to 100percent and leave on for about 6 day w o charging for the money and battery life i went with the amazfit gts 4,['battery']
254,the only weakest point is the battery 36 h is not enough they can do better this watch can save life is god forbid example lost in a forest stuck in building during earthquake emergency 911 whatever reason it can do a lot lot thing but battery my be the reason,['battery']
255,bro the apple commercial made it look like the battery would last for a month only 2 day,['battery']
256,a a non water person or traveler i need this for it multi day battery only it is annoying charging every night i forget to strap it on often lol and the screen is bigger,['battery']
257,when the battery last two week i will think about it,['battery']
258,a for the battery life i have a charging station at the side of my bed wireless charging for my phone watch amp airpods every night,['battery']
259,the battery life on these are absolutely amazing for an apple product even if you are not an extreme athlete it is still great to have for just busy body always on the move,['battery']
260,love the battery but i still want more battery life a whole week worth of battery and it should still only take a hour to charge good luck apple,['battery']
261,elderly like my mom that need larger and brighter screen not tech savvy need battery life and need the safety feature like fall alert sound extreme but service that do fall alert usually charge like dollar50 a month which make apple watch ultra all the sudden sound reasonable dollar10 a month for cell service and watch pay for itself versus cost of fall alert service within a year plus provides her a lot accessibility feature than just fall alert,['battery']
262,very impressed woth the battery took it off it is charger on thursday morning used it a normal did not ever engage low power mode sunday morning still on 15percent not bad,['battery']
263,i have a realme watch s severely limited feature ha a 390 mah battery but last like 15 20 day cost around dollar100 so like what is actually eating the battery on those guy doe accuracy in health monitoring and gps really eat up that much battery,['battery']
264,i guess apple people are easily amazed i am not sure what you all are putting into your kool aid but i have absolutely no idea how you all can tolerate the insanely poor battery performance of the aw lineup i get 3 week of continuous use from my garmin fenix before i need to charge it i really want to like the awu but the price and laughable lack of battery performance is a deal breaker for me,['battery']
265,definitely overkill for me for what i do but the size and battery life make it the winner,['battery']
266,my two cent coming in a little bit late lol the apple watch in my opinion look way better in the larger version the apple watch ultra i have always felt that the previous version looked a little cheap even though i have worn the apple watch seven with this being said to me the battery is better the look is absolutely much better and at least if you are wearing a nicer band it actually get a lot of compliment i would like to see this watch another 4 mm bigger would be perfect,['battery']
267,2 day and 2 night and having 2o percent of battery left pff dude that is lame i use my huawei for 24 7 and then i need to change it and watch it is almost 3 year old and it is way more cheaper then this new apple ultra,['battery']
268,a a travel photographer that go to extreme place this wa a must for me i swim with shark free diving am on my way to hike to photograph silverback gorilla in rwanda after which i will be in the desert of egypt and then am heading to antarctica to photograph whale that is a normal routine for me i do not take my phone on these excursion because the risk of losing dropping or breaking them is pretty high a well a an animal grabbing it which monkey or lemur will do so i purchased the cellular ultra but i understand most people are not doing these thing so i think it may be unnecessary for them i had a fitbit but this watch obviously doe more my fitbit battery last way longer i had the apple store make sure my screen stay off which they said will give me a few more day of battery life,['battery']
269,i would only get this for the screen size and battery alone i currently have the se2,['battery']
270,so hey i am not an athlete at all or anything even close to it but i do love these apple watch i do a let of text while working and have found the apple watch a good way to make that faster instead of taking your phone out unlocking it opening message etc so for someone like me out of all the apple watch out there which do you think would be the best i like this ultra with the longer battery life but do not know if i really need all those extra feature that i will probably never use thanks bud vinnie from alaska,['battery']
271,garmin is laughing at this battery life lol if you are going to spend 800 dollar on a watch get a real watch,['battery']
272,personally price is not crazy since i am already in the garmin universe i just can not justify this one because lack of cycling power meter support which is a huge l and the battery life can not compare to a garmin either you do not need apple watch functionality or want it tbh when backpacking 5 day i am really glad apple entered this space though garmin ha not had great competition and ha been getting by with sub standard software for far too long,['battery']
273,just got the se and i am loving it but one thing i wish if for bigger battery btw my se going for 2 day without a charge ik it say 18 hour but nope i had it on my wrist for 2 day straight and 1 2 night,['battery']
274,it rubbish and a toy till it ha 10 day battery do not make these hype pl,['battery']
275,honestly the battery life is the sole reason i have never owned a smart watch regular watch last year and year,['battery']
276,finally ha a samsung battery but i am not paying 800 for just a samsung battery,['battery']
277,for autistic and adhd folk the durability and battery life is much more appealing than the standard series watch considering the amount of problem with screen popping out and damage to the case,['battery']
278,slept with 69 per cent battery hmmmm okay,['battery']
279,thanks for the great review a always very detailed and hit the point especially on battery life such a nice upgrade to the normal apple watch that are dead every day with moderate daily exercise,['battery']
280,yep 2 day i can charge on day one around 8am and run it that day the evening full day another evening and charge the following morning you could say 3 day however it is clearly a two full day watch battery two and a bit if you let it run down below 20percent,['battery']
281,why do not you say 2 day of battery instead 2 day 2 night,['battery']
282,this is the first smart watch that ha gotten my attention i do wear a number of automatic watch and i am a big g shock fan a well all of which i own are solar both of these do not rely on replacing battery and that is something that stick out for a number of watch people unfortunately i think the only two thing that will keep me from buying it is that i can not get a bluetooth wifi only model and it is still largely a novelty because my career doe not allow me to use it while working it is very cool though i just can not see paying for cellular service for a watch and there would never be a time that i could be wearing this watch that i do not also have my iphone on me,['battery']
283,my series 4 watch battery dy pretty quick now if i do not charge it one night it is pretty much dead the next day which it suck whenever i go camping for the weekend i have to bring my charger for it a well plus the bigger screen definitely look nice,['battery']
284,that 3 day battery is good for apple appalling for garmin,['battery']
285,dominick west garmin watch are better fitness watch and have longer battery life the apple watch is better at everything else,['battery']
286,if you want a series adventure watch just get a garmin a 2 day battery life on a watch like this is simply not good enough,['battery']
287,all this smart tech is rubbish you will want to replace it with a newer model in 2 year and you will have to replace it in 5 year because it will be so out of date and the battery capacity non existent i bought a casio protrek solar powered watch 20 year ago and still work perfect these watch are designed to be dumped and replaced in a short time that is how apple and other similar manufacturer make money,['battery']
288,my biggest issue is just the battery life i do not need the extra feature on the watch but it wa so infuriating with my apple watch 4 when i wanted to go for a 2 hour mountain bike ride i realised i had not charged it during the night because of sleep tracking or morning i forgot the really short battery life really is a big issue because you are supposed to be wearing it 24 7 and you really need to plan on when you charge it daily,['battery']
289,patrick howie i am not going to bother with a device that requires daily planning on my part for it to do what it is supposed to 3 day of battery life in normal use is something that a watch need at minimum,['battery']
290,not good enough for the prize the battery life dude stop promoting junk,['battery']
291,agamerjoinedyt it is possible and the watch doe not look good there are also more watch out there with more battery life right now apple watch give me iphone 3 design vibe round and square with curving surface,['battery']
292,tbh this wa is appealing simply because of the battery increase personally i would take a slightly chunkier watch for an extra while day of battery any day my main gripe with my apple watch 45mm series 7 aluminum is that if i wear it all day and sleep with it the next day it is almost dead and i have to charge it before going about my day the 2 day life would be amazing,['battery']
293,would have liked to see the battery life compared to other smart watch i do not think anyone expects them to be even remotely comparable to regular watch haha,['battery']
294,my garmin venu 2 last about 11 day on one charge i use it for heart rate stress level energy level which ha gotten more and more accurate the more i use it and step tracking i do have the option for weather and text message and other stuff since it connects to my iphone but i always have my iphone on me or within 4ft of me so no need for those option plus it make the battery last longer thanks to amazon i have tried multiple smart watch and i am most content with my garmin venu 2 the new apple watch doe look super cool but for dollar800 i would rather put that money to other apple product tbh i am not even a fan of the apple headphone so i returned those might try out this new apple watch but just to try it out and return it later on shout out to amazon fr the return policy is so long it is basically a trial period lol,['battery']
295,i find these smart watch thingies kinda redundant i would perhaps care when they last for at least a week which even that feel way too short a battery life for what they are trying to replace,['battery']
296,still doe not have enough battery to do a full triathlon sticking with sport watch like the garmin who own this option,['battery']
297,garmin us different screen technology i do not remember what is it is called but it greatly increase battery life caveat is the screen is not a good visually especially the sapphire version which is fairly dim for me i prefer the durability of my fenix over the apple watch 3 i had i have seen video where apple is sapphire is not a good a garmins gerryrigeverything ha a video about it,['battery']
298,it is all up to each person to determine wether the purchase of this watch is worth it to them in my opinion it is bigger ha a few more feature longer battery more durable and i think i wa looking for something more that stood out to me my current apple watch will suffice until something truly unique to me stand out and i can not justify spending dollar800 on this watch when my significan not other purchased one for about dollar500 for me a a christmas present not even two year ago excellent review btw i found this helpful,['battery']
299,never really been much of a watch guy but i hate how much i use my phone and carry my phone with me this may just be the pill i need now that the battery life is getting better,['battery']
300,brian washington their pricing strategy i fell for it i wa like i need a watch def going to invest in stainless steel to have it for longer time but then when i compared the price i wa like i will take the better battery and bigger screen for extra dollar50,['battery']
301,just bought one first apple watch in year always wanted something a little bit more rugged with more battery,['battery']
302,lol they finally did it i have been in apple ecosystem for a while but i do not find the apple watch really helpful the old watch will not even last a marathon or ultramarathons that take 10 hour that is why most runner i know spend on pricey garmin or suunto multisport watch this is also the reason why i stick with my miband for now because i prefer the sleep and heart rate tracking functionality with battery lasting 5 7 day do not know will check it maybe in the future i am already lazy charging my phone airpods and macbook i prefer if they can build the watch battery to last one week cuz yah know it is just a watch lol,['battery']
303,0 42 it is not fair you have theatre mode that turn off always on so make a better review on battery next time but for the rest keep it going,['battery']
304,i am a beginner alpinist who climb above 13 and 14 thousand foot and i definitely would not mind an avalanche alarm great gps a well a long battery life plus tracking calorie and fitness stuff during bjj or rock climbing and the gym would be great,['battery']
305,the apple watch ultra is ultimately apple is pro watch it ha the pro feature like an action button pro apps sensor biggest battery life and is the strongest overall it depends on what you will use it for but it is twice a expensive a the apple watch series 8,['battery']
306,i got it for the battery life,['battery']
307,quite frankly i do not know how ultra marathoner or cyclist can use this the battery at best is 30 hour without any function if you use the gps or any other fuction when working out i am guessing at best get 7 hour of battery life for longer race this without a recharge is tough,['battery']
308,watch look amazing but honestly if i am on a multi day hike off the grid i am not going to rely on apple watch w a 2 3 day battery life suppose it work for some scenario though,['battery']
309,yeah but my 200dollar seiko can last longer without a battery and doesnt need a gps,['battery']
310,i wonder how viable it would be to develop a trickle charge ability tapping into body heat and kinetic energy from moving it about combined with some advanced solar tech the battery could potentially last way longer of course size is an issue too,['battery']
311,i do not even use my apple watch ultra for workout anymore it keep locking on me because it think it is off of my wrist since i have tattoo on my wrist therefore it block the optical reader it is completely annoying and the only way to stop it is to take off the apple pay but then it still will not read my heart rate my garmin fenix 7x sapphire solar heart rate only work if i push it below the knob on my wrist but the garmin pay always work and the watch never lock on me also the apple watch doe not count rep in the gym and that is ridiculous i where my garmin to support me on workout and the apple ultra for day to day when i am not working out i strap the garmin to my ankle so i can still get the metric not to mention the battery life is so much better on the garmin i am an amateur athlete but my workout can last up to 6 hour with a long run boxing biking and weight i also compete in ultramarathons and i will only trust my garmin for that,['battery']
312,promoting 2 day of battery life give me the shittiest feeling it should be atleast a week which other smart watch maker like fitbit and garmin offer,['battery']
313,casio g shock and other solar casios do not have a big bright oled screen and battery wasting feature so they require le power which mean a smaller solar panel the apple watch could not fit a solar panel big enough to power it,['battery']
314,wish they would do a iphone ultra with a huge battery some of u do not care about having the thinnest lightest phone eh,['battery']
315,my only worry about skipping this watch for next year watch ultra is that the price will either raise or they will keep the s6 2020 chip for a fourth year in a row but i am definitely waiting and i am hoping next year ultra ha exclusive feature to the ultra with more colour option even smaller bezel being able to see more with the big screen instead of the same a 45mm where even though the 49mm ultra is bigger you are seeing the same content where a you are seeing le on the 41mm an actual new chip in it will be great too one thing i know apple will not do is give u the option to choose what colour the action button will be i would have picked red action button with navy blue or black casing big hope is for a new chip inside instead of a rebranded one like they did last year and this year even smaller bezel and more feature longer battery life 36 hour is not enough it may be for others but it genuinely is not more watch face wired charging for longer battery health,['battery']
316,the battery kill it for me i have gotten over a week battery life out of my garmin watch,['battery']
317,your very valid post of battery life is why i have not yet bought a smartwatch my mechanical watch work by the wearer moving or my g shock solar make it easy to pick up the next morning in a rush and go having to charge my watch is something i am not accustomed to probably will not ever be lol it is a nice piece but a a diver i will stick to my tried and true purpose built dove computer with 30 plus year in the business,['battery']
318,there is one point i would like to find out that apple watch ultra is targeting extreme weather sport i just wonder that how the battery design facing those condition are they using enduro battery design,['battery']
319,i love the look of the ultra and the hardened feature but i hesitate to spend dollar800 on a watch that is battery will degrade in a couple year time no matter what you do i will stick with the normal apple watch for almost half the cost of the ultra,['battery']
320,a couple thing 1 sleep tracking is useless you do not need a watch to tell you if you had a good night rest and it feel uncomfortable wearing a watch while sleeping i find it unnecessary 2 battery life is overrated at least in the aspect of comparing 60 hour to 1 week like other watch it take literally zero effort to put the device on a charger at night 3 this watch is not even big it also still light garmin amp suunto are literally monster and twice the price can not justify spending 1500 for a smartwatch but the 800 is just right i mean there are people who spend 2k on a regular watch that doe nothing but tell time having said that i am considering this now too i have the series 7 but the face is already scratched from kayaking trip and kettlebells i hike in warmer month and the extra battery is good for camping trip when i am outside for 2 day but definitely do not need a week worth of battery but a weekend worth is perfect the waypoint is definitely a game changer,['battery']
321,dollar800 watch battery should last at least a week lmao,['battery']
322,if battery last for more than a week then it name is suitable otherwise it is just name ultra,['battery']
323,this is why i hate smart watch a good g shock will last decade and if the battery dy it is easy to unscrew the back and put a new coin cell in,['battery']
324,for the second group that doe long hiking it still miss too much good offline map are an essential thing which is missing on the apple watch and the battery life is still bad compared to the garmin watch specialized on that particular group the two band gps is not really knew other specialized watch have that too,['battery']
325,i wish there phone had this battery life personally i do not find the watch appealing i see no use for it,['battery']
326,i thought i would be in to this watch using it the same a my other apple watch the battery will not last until evening the first day the cellular doe not work well enough to use alone without the phone spotify would not work with my airpods i could only play music i had downloaded to my watch the workout app constantly pause right in the middle of my workout i left my phone in the locker at the gym with cellular bluetooth and wi fi turned off and my watch kept trying to play music on it successfully instead of my airpods it is a cool looking watch though and it is not a huge watch like i keep hearing everyone say if you think it is huge you should probably eat more protein or something because you obviously have tiny dainty wrist,['battery']
327,ngl i am a hardcore android user but the apple watch ha me thinking and the more or le 3 day of battery ha me hooked just need to buy an iphone,['battery']
328,00 15 69percent battery nice mkbhd,['battery']
329,it is cool but it is also going to be trash in a few year when you want an upgrade i would actually be interested in this watch if it wa more of a life time or 20 year proposition where the internal component could be updated paying this much money for something which will be obsoleted next year seems weird to me seems like an expensive toy i do have a garmin forerunner 945 i get week of battery and i love it it is a smart watch but it is also kind of dumb and feel like something i could have for a long time although i guess the battery will go sooner or later and it will be headed for the landfill,['battery']
330,that is great battery life but dollar800 i do not mind charging mine lol,['battery']
331,they should try making the ultra longer battery maybe 5 day or up maybe all will drool on the watch i will want it if it 5days 2 day is ok but let be practical,['battery']
332,it is the battery if you want an apple watch you would like to wear it all day then wear through the night at time to monitor sleep and health for the benefit it is designed to provide without charging it every day,['battery']
333,an apple watch is limited to battery power apple should made it with solar charging i wait for generation 15 and when the price is dollar399 00 instead of dollar799 00,['battery']
334,a bit late here but i am looking for this watch when the model arrives to my country i have an se and week ago i had to call an ambulance because of my heart i am a heart transplant patient when the ambulance arrived the guy noticed my watch asked for my phone and check the daily rhythm and other stats he double checked with the machine and all after that he told me that maybe a series 7 or 8 would be nice cause it have other useful stats and i wa like ok then the doctor at the emergency room took my phone and did the exact same thing after spent the night at the emergency room i asked them about the watch they told me that they obviously double check everything with specialized machinery but the watch and phone give them an analysis of what wa happening earlier that day and week and is a reaaaally good addition now looking at the ultra i am tempted because battery alarm sound because i am 70percent deaf and all the stuff that the se do not have now is expensive but having those stuff make me feel a little le worried when i am outside in other country or similar situation i am not an extreme user a apple show in the video but i think all the people with heart disease love the watch and they could focus on that and have a lot of new potential user old people transplanted person etc,['battery']
335,so lem me guess it straight apple expect u to buy a 1000dollar phone a 400 800dollar tablet and a 400 800dollar watch every 3 4 5 year a the battery becomes crap or the o becomes super outdated and or unsupported any middle class person who ha a family or a mortgage can not afford that crap unless you live on your credit card eat only unhealthy food like kraft diner r do not save money for rainy day it is not even close fun time we live in also all the environment friendly thing they claim to do when they try to push all these disposable gadget pure greenwashing android can be cheaper but is much worse for battery swapping or updating the o the only way i can afford gadget while paying my mortgage and being financially responsible saving money is buy them used in place like marketplace and run them into the ground until they basically explode,['battery']
336,2 5 day of battery charge will have to wait till it hit atleast 7 day since this will not do well with multi day trek,['battery']
337,i have a withings scanwatch it is not that smart a watch but it go about 4 week between charge apple ha just squared the reason i am still not buying any apple watch battery shape and size,['battery']
338,until the next update that decrease your battery drastically lol,['battery']
339,turn off cellular and tell u how long the battery lasted you never mentioned how well that worked,['battery']
340,the main question is have you used it when your phone is near by i have an apple watch series 4 and the battery doe not even last for 8 hour if i use it only with the cell option,['battery']
341,2 day lol fenix 7x take week to run out of battery even sense2 take almost whole week,['battery']
342,some people work on a google server floor and would like the battery life flashlight data to not have their phone going through a metal detector all day and have health issue where finally temperature tracking is on the apple watch lol,['battery']
343,the biggest problem with this apple watch is the price at that price it is in garmin fenix price point which ha a battery life of over 10 day it is feature are all higher spec that the apple watch it ha more accurate gps with 3 different source solar charging so the battery life is extended basically it ha load of feature that other watch already do better the lack of being able to connect to third party sensor like a chest strap is also frustrating if it were cheaper it would fill a space which doe not overlap with better device unfortunately it doe not,['battery']
344,i need some help my ultra i turn to low power mode by noon and still by 1600 i am at 20 30percent battery it not on cellular mode however i get hundred of outlook notification some advice from someone pls,['battery']
345,sound like you either have every single app running in the background constantly pinging and using up battery or you just got a bad battery in your watch i have had it for about 3 week and i have never had it last fewer than 2 full day,['battery']
346,not sure why everyone is praising the battery life i am laying in bed and it is gone down 3percent,['battery']
347,ended that day by going to sleep with about 69percent battery brief pause nice hahahahahaha,['battery']
348,my current apple watch series 5 get me throughout the day and ha lasted through all my half marathon a long a i remember to charge it it slipped off the charger and i almost lost the the last two mile of flying pig i do have issue sometimes with gps in city like chicago and manhattan the straight line that cut thru building and road are pretty annoying and mess with the pace but apple is made gps better with each watchos iteration i guess i do not absolutely need this version of the apple watch but i do like bigger watch face and the longer battery life will be nice my next run are vega and disney so gps will not be an issue but coming from series 5 i will get vox and that metric will be neat to see i will have to check out the band on your estore,['battery']
349,i am tired of buying a stainless steel or titanium watch sapphire crystal that is disposable in 5 year all these premium material in a disposable watch just doe not make sense with all the genius sitting at apple they need to re engineer the apple watch where you can replace the battery easily 4 screw and replace the battery i like to argue the the apple watch is more expensive that most swiss watch if you consider you have no watch after a few year it a houdini watch now you have it next you do not why did i come to this point i have the apple watch original series this is now considered vintage by apple can not service it the battery died i paid 1 099 for it in 2015 stainless and sapphire crystal 2015 wa not so long ago in the watch world this ultra watch will not even last 10 year so is not this so expensive to own and use you will be still rocking your rolex 30 year from now the economics of apple watch is just plain bad for u perfect for apple the richest company in the world,['battery']
350,battery with lte network or wifi or any other connection may be show true battery consumption,['battery']
351,answering my own question it is stronger strong enough to feel during vigorous exercise i am also getting 4 5 day battery life the watch is the best apple watch by far 8 10,['battery']
352,battery life is not anywhere what i need and you still need an iphone impressive nevertheless,['battery']
353,i just picked up the fenix 6 sapphire on sale to replace my apple watch just for the battery life i got tired of having to pack another charger around when i travel and go hunting i wa jealous of my buddy and their garmins and never having to charge them,['battery']
354,i have never had an apple watch and just got my first iphone 13 pro max since the iphone 4 for me i will probably never use half the stuff that is capable in the watch but i just wanted to have the best apple watch on the market so i bought it the battery life 2k nit and aesthetic are enough for me,['battery']
355,i just received the new ultra and the size is not a surprise from a 45mm i like the overall look but the battery is what i am waiting to see if it is going to do it for me i can not wait for that software update that is suppose to add more battery life a well the durability is what got me looking at this one a well i banged up my series 7 the glass around the curve wa always taking hit i like the flat top with the protective rim of the ultra it feel heavier to me than a 45mm when i put it on i wa like ok i thought the weight wa not a thing but it is noticeable,['battery']
356,apple watch ultra battery life suck ball compared to amazfit garmin fitbit,['battery']
357,good battery life until apple kill it next year with an update,['battery']
358,battery life is shit to begin with any other smartwatch destroys the watch ultra in battery life,['battery']
359,curious on what your setting are to get that kind of battery life that is well beyond apple is claim of 36 hour which is what i typically get,['battery']
360,i am a garmin fenix user and i laugh at this battery life i get 2 week minimum out of mine with ten of gps activity,['battery']
361,at 1 11 the airpod battery noise scared me and i had to listen again thought my airpods were dying,['battery']
362,why doe it not have a ultra low battery mode already,['battery']
363,wow 3 day battery life and all that can be yours for dollar800 apple can go suck a lemon,['battery']
364,i ended that day going to sleep with about 69percent battery nice,"['battery', 'battery']"
365,69percent battery nice getting a thumb up just for that,['battery']
366,garmin is laughing at that battery life,['battery']
367,garmin user here when apple can reach the 2 week battery life then i can think about switching,['battery']
368,marque 69 percent battery life nice lmaoooo,['battery']
369,i am 100percent happy with my garmin epix 2 with awesome screen offline map and 2 week battery life,['battery']
370,hey apple i do not care about sport diving or climbing i am a regular office worker with mostly outlook notification how about a week of battery life no thought so,['battery']
371,battery life is trash garmin 7 for me,['battery']
372,battery still suck people will still buy this for luxury not necessity,['battery']
373,the main reason i left behind my apple watch wa for battery life i really really liked my apple watch and what i wanted it to do i wanted it to track my sleep step and calorie i did not use most of the other stuff it could do i went over to a garmin forerunner 945 and like it too it doe a million thing i will never use but i literally get 8 10 day on a single charge i know there are a plethora of other smart watch that get 5 10 day on a single charge what the heck can not apple create a watch that doe that i am sure this new watch will get 3 5 day if you are not going crazy with every single feature for me i want sleep tracking step and track my workout that is it i might think about going back to the apple watch the ultra but 8 hundo is pretty steep my garmin wa 6 hundy which is a lot dollar200 more for the ultra it is dope though,['battery']
374,well i am no athlete but i am excited to try the sleep tracking coming from the series 5 though what i want to ask is how low can i get the battery while keeping it in a good cycle meaning i will not destroy the future battery of the apple watch for i remember back in the series 5 or so time it wa recommended to charge your watch and not let it go under 50percent of charge so i just want to ask how low can i push the battery without destroying the future use of the apple watch for all day and all night use,['battery']
375,you can utilize the feature of apple watch ultra if you are an athlete but man look at that it impressive especially the battery life i mostly use my apple watch to track my sleep i am not athlete nor heavy workout person but i still want that i think it is worth it to upgrade,['battery']
376,el a g itr n it is not a bad watch but personally i like the garmin tactix better i have used the ultra in the same situation i use the delta and the feature are a little better garmin is just an all around outdoor watch the ultra is not bad but i would use it if i had to the battery life between them both is just not comparable so if your planing on being out for day at a time i would not recommend the ultra i got the ultra more for when i am on my bike especially using the gps feature for when i am in the road i did test it out in the wood and it not bad just try to cary an external power supply,['battery']
377,ill stick to my garmin battery life is much better,['battery']
378,haha battery life is the only reason i want this watch,['battery']
379,it should have the battery life at least 5 day to compete with garmin all the feature are cool but those people would not budge in 36 hour battery life,['battery']
380,why i left apple watch is because of battery life i can not enjoy wearing my apple watch for at least a week without having it charged everyday so i am currently wearing garmin tactix 7 pro ballistic it last me month or so without charging same material a the new apple watch ultra it ha more what can apple watch ultra could offer for daily and other rugged activity,['battery']
381,returning mine today after work gave it a 24 hour test battery wa at 50percent after one full day going back to fitbit 5 day battery huge fail for apple,['battery']
382,battery huawei,['battery']
383,casio watch battery go 10 year,['battery']
384,i would buy it just for the better battery life phone clarity volume and gps i do not care about anything else,['battery']
385,i think this watch is not enough for the price gbp800 and you get 3 day if you are lucky all the people who this product is aimed at are probably already into the garmin ecosystem and have been using watch like the fenix with 21 day battery life for year,['battery']
386,if apple watch ultra can not connect to diving equipment it is useless for proper diver and it doe not have the tech to connect to your oxygen tank to see the oxygen level remaining apple watch ultra is a luxury item with a big battery it is not for diver and with screen at max brightness it will die long before you finish a very long bicycle race for example,['battery']
387,i wear an apple watch 5 45mm and i just got this and can not wait for the awesome battery life i am a woman and i like big watch,['battery']
388,stupid question but if this phone is for endurance athlete how would you charge your battery if you a hundred mile in the wood or on top of mount everest,['battery']
389,it amazes me how a dollar100 watch battery can last for over a week and a dollar800 watch battery can only last two day and you call that good a a matter of fact my health insurance sent me the watch for free that they paid dollar50 for,['battery']
390,i have my og galaxy watch and the battery last about 5 day straight,['battery']
391,i am probably considered an average user but the battery of the ultra is very appealing i use for sleep tracking for health so very appealing indeed to have a few day wear without charging is it nice looking on woman wrist too my wrist are kind of small so i worried about the aesthetic but it is very appealing especially for the charging great review thank you,['battery']
392,so basically it ha the amount of battery life a normal apple watch should already have lol,['battery']
393,im returning my se 2 for an ultra i do lot of activity outside and workout 5 day a week i feel like ultra is win for me and it different compared to other watch the battery life got my attention,['battery']
394,maybe it is just not convenient for enough people but i use my galaxy watch for week to well over a month without charging becasue i put in on battery only mode when i am not in need of additional feature of course charging is not really an issue either unless you are sleep tracking but it is just one of those thing that i do not understand how the battery life is an inconvenience there are plenty of time during the day when you can charge it up while doing something else,['battery']
395,i am really interested in this watch because of the longer battery life the compass and the red light filter while i understand that battery life is pretty limited on the normal apple watch i find that the compass app and the filter are thing they definitely could add i am not into any extreme sport though so i can not justify buying an apple watch ultra,['battery']
396,please come back in a month a let u now how the battery is holding i love my apple watch but it seems that everytime i get a new one the battery is good for only like a month and then i have to charge it every night,['battery']
397,i get 10 12 day of battery with my garmin fenix how are wearable user still putting up with daily charging,['battery']
398,the day my smartwatch only ha 3 day of battery life remaining is the day i throw it out,['battery']
399,a a motorcycle rider the apple watch is such a pain in the a the battery life is so bad and you always have to take the charging cable with you i wish there would be an apple watch that last 5 day which is great for a nice motorcycle trip or work week i wa really looking forward for the ultra but now i will look for an alternative,['battery']
400,thanks for good review like you said 2 3 day of battery life is nothing for a outdoor action watch i just do not know why apple do not make solar apple watch so you can be in the jungle camping for week without electricity can wait for that day,['battery']
401,disappointing for price no built in navigation map like the garmin watch which do not require a cell signal or data to update and have 16 day battery life so ultra not a useful for serious hiker or pro outdoor type,['battery']
402,bought the apple watch 6 in 2021 battery is still good i like the watch but i would not buy another one,['battery']
403,it is a great watch with good battery life that doe not feel heavy or too big on my wrist i never got a smartwatch and waited year for apple to come out with a watch like this because others apple built look like toy this look more like a real watch and the new function make it pay for itself a a dive computer is pretty expensive too i wa not sure in the beginning and my girlfriend hated the idea of a smartwatch but already after a few day we both think that it is a pretty cool device,['battery']
404,insert garmin fenix meme adventurer biker mountaineer military garmin ha gps map 2 week battery life up to infinite if you get solar if you ask any military person garmin fenix is the only watch they recommend if it lasted 1 week and did not have an orange button then maybe otherwise for that price point you will get more from the last gen fenix than an apple watch,['battery']
405,for that price i will ride with garmin forerunner 945 battery last me minimum two week putting in work with it apple been playing catch up if you ask me maybe for a inside gym quick session and going out for look yea but not for all the way outdoor fully activity like they make it seem garmin the goat of that,['battery']
406,i ended the day with 69percent battery nice hahaha i see what you did there,['battery']
407,battery life is pretty shit,['battery']
408,lol i will stick with garmin 17 day of battery,['battery']
409,69percent battery nice lmao,['battery']
410,i want the ultra to replace my series 7 because of the screen size and flatness and battery life and i do not do any of those other recreational activity,['battery']
411,you can not pack all the pro feature to one device this size they did make all of them just enough it feel like but i still would get device made specifically for the thing i am doing rather than a watch with 10 000 different feature professional deep diver will not use the ultra since it cap out at 40m 130ft professional hiker could use it but a garmin watch for example a garmin fenix 7x sapphire solar that ha the necessary feature for hiking not a smart watch tho with 28 day of battery life the ultra matron people will definitely not choose a apple watch because of comfort garmin ha the forerunner series for that a an armature athlete i use a garmin forerunner 245 music while a professional friend of mine us a 945 music both with 10 day of battery life,['battery']
412,i work in the construction field and a couple year ago i bought the apple watch i think the series 4 and within a week it wa all scratched up now the ultra with the sapphire crystal would be a game changer for me because it is way more scratch resistant and also the battery life of course,['battery']
413,comparing the battery life of a smart watch with a conventional watch make no sense they are two completely different gadget,['battery']
414,69percent battery nay,['battery']
415,great review but i think you are missing a massive subset of potential user people who need a simple rugged watch with increased battery life such a police fire and em the apple watch failed in two aspect prior it wa not rugged enough for job that require a more physical nature and the battery life required to frequent charging given some occupation is shift some firefighter and em work 48hr shift a typical apple watch would not make it through one complete shift on a single charge but taking the watch off at night to charge it would not be feasible the ultra is the first apple watch that is on the job compliant in that it can last an entire shift plus is hearty enough to take the daily physical abuse running an ultra marathon or scuba diving is a niche market that is over glamorized for apple is marketing making a watch that police fire em can wear now that is breaking into an untapped market,['battery']
416,you forget about the cycling crowd battery life is still barely enough and no ant support or able to connect ble sensor for very important thing like watt meter heart rate band to get accurate reading cadence and so on,['battery']
417,69percent battery nice i like that this ha like become the standard thing to say after the number 69,['battery']
418,that battery should last a month my casio battery last for 10 year my kindle last for a month no way a 2022 model of a smart watch should not last at least a week with modern battery technology fail by apple imho,['battery']
419,marque i have gained a lot of very valuable information from you in the past and it is the same for this review so thank you i will say however a an avid skier xc triathlete and backcountry hiker this watch doe not quite do it i did not see in your review if it could download a gpx file for you to follow with turn by turn guidance the battery a you said is very short when compared to other adventure watch for reference i work out every day for at least an hour running gravel biking mountain biking swimming and many hour on weekend my garmin 945 last more than a week with all of that activity i do not think the ultra can monitor power which is a key cycling metric which triathletes track the only thing that i really wish my watch did that the ultra doe is allow me to respond to text message if i had a non iphone actually it would but unfortunately apple just doe not support other brand communicating with it device very well at all,['battery']
420,honestly extreme watch doe not make much sense if come w o garmin like solar powered battery,['battery']
421,garmen battery still last waaaaaay longer,['battery']
422,so apple made watch with sub par battery capability for almost a decade and now we have to be at awe of their greatness a they finally made a watch with decent not good battery life,['battery']
423,better battery life but garmin fenix watch are still my go to watch for fitness,['battery']
424,69percent battery nice that made me laugh more than it should have,['battery']
425,i just need the battery from that watch and insert it onto my series 2 i would be so happy,['battery']
426,the battery life is a joke outside of isheeps,['battery']
427,the gps and battery life 2 plus day like you said new daily but not for dress up,['battery']
428,whoopy so it is 36 hour battery compare that to garmin month long battery just in case it is needed for a mountain climb v the fake adventurer is that may think this will be there to save them when it will not,['battery']
429,i just got mine on release day and love it so far great info on the battery optimization yet to release,['battery']
430,i am very interested to see how well the battery hold up long term my series 4 apple watch barely last a full day now but when i got it it would last a day and a half with my usage great video marque,['battery']
431,dollar800 seems a lot for a watch but then again dollar800 is not too much for a watch if you are looking outside the budget or entry level analog watch i have owned the huawei watch and galaxy watch and from what i have seen i think apple is watch are a far better implementation v wearos with tizen being a bit better than wearos in my time using my smartwatches extended battery life is certainly a plus since it feel like everything need charging nowadays ultimately i just went back to my citizen promaster sst which charge via sunlight no smart feature but enough for me personally,['battery']
432,the new watch ha a better presentation than the new iphone 2 day of battery life is sad when huawei best watch ha a 14 day battery life with all the same feature a this new watch,['battery']
433,what about the battery health kind of like on how iphone you are able to see if it is healthy or if it is time to be replaced that is what i want on android instead of guessing when you need a new battery it will just tell you the battery health of the matter i want to see that in the android please make it happen,['battery']
434,i fault your logic that only a fraction of watch user want the feature you are most excited about battery life i would argue that every single watch user would appreciate having that same battery life i think every user can take advantage of longer battery life not just pro user apple just chooses to charge a premium for basic feature that should be free i also think any user would appreciate ruggedness think your average high school or college student imho it is a rip off if you consider the dollar450 competing delivers pretty much all of those at half the price,['battery']
435,if we are honest this is the range rover of watch a very small fraction of the people that will buy this will use any of the extreme sport feature and even those that do will be exactly like yourself weekend warrior not professional diver or alpinist i expect those extreme sport activity occur over many week or month most extreme sport athlete i expect use a heart rate chest strap a it is much more accurate than a wrist based one the super vibrant color screen kill battery life that is why the high end garmen watch are black and white which doe not sacrifice function over form also the ergonomics of the watch are laughable at best they really need to work on their hardware instead of software but most tech company are not good at that which is why tesla remains one of the most unreliable vehicle on the planet this is a classic apple money grab plain and simple and those that do not see it are probably just apple fan boy,['battery']
436,you are missing another group i just like fancy stuff hah i wa looking for a reason to upgrade and more durable bigger battery and new party trick wa just what i needed,['battery']
437,not bad although my garmin fenix 6x pro solar still get about 22 day of battery life it track my workout 6 day a week my sleep every day us gps on my run ha actual map is far more resilient more water resistant more shock resistant more everything resistant and the new one have even more battery life and the tactic version is infrared or night vision compatible apple make a nice watch but they will never come close to garmin,['battery']
438,they will not come close to garmin until they change their screen technology oled or whatever it us eats too much battery that is what i have heard at least love my garmin,['battery']
439,what about the ppl that just want crazy battery life lmao,['battery']
440,this is a poor man is garmin pro in my opinion in term of the perfect adventure watch if anyone is considering a watch for activity sport tracking then you would be mad not to consider the garmin fenix range the battery is still dreadful compared to my garmin nice style here from apple though but they are far away from a real sport watch still,['battery']
441,no fiuck your stupid as drawing everybody need ruggedness feature battery,['battery']
442,i have a fossil 6 i wanted a samsung both the same price but doe not work with iphones the battery barely last 24 hour on extended mode i can not afford a dollar800 watch,['battery']
443,i love apple watch i left for garmin because 22days battery life and map over path in forest apple can not do that apple messures tvings thats not realy is important and just stress people,['battery']
444,at the beginning of the video the watch wa on theater mode that is why the battery lasted so long,['battery']
445,do you have notification on i feel like the notification kill the battery life,['battery']
446,meanwhile galaxy watch4 with around 5 day lit of the box battery hmm,['battery']
447,that battery life and screen alone is reason to upgrade i bought one and love it,['battery']
448,i do not do any of that sport stuff and i work in it i do not need any of those top end feature but i got this watch anyway because the battery and size i have wanted one but never liked the smaller one battery for battery reason and the material,['battery']
449,yes worth it just for the extra battery life,['battery']
450,hi marque they have come long way to still i guess little more to catch up with garmin especially if you consider battery life and more accuracy obviously the integration of apple ecosystem in cellular version like ultra which is edge over garmin and the ecg or body temperature but still little long way to catch up on the mentioned thing and ruggedness hopefully they will catchup soon till then i am on garmin fenix pro solar series what do say about that,['battery']
451,what would be an instant solution to the battery life not lasting a long a other rugged extreme watch is if they made a band that had solar charging panel and allowed the charge to go through to the metal band locking point,['battery']
452,my ultra is not lasting nearly this long did you run yours in low battery mode for some of the time,['battery']
453,nice review and i am exactly one of outside people yet will not buy those a the battery is not simply good enough for me the minimum is week on battery to event think about buying any watch tbh i am surprised that apple did not built long battery with their watch such a innovative company full of genius people yet battery suck while competitor have it for year,['battery']
454,if apple watch battery can last day why do not they make the iphone battery last that long bro,['battery']
455,i am buying one for sure just for the battery life doe it have cellular feature if so it is also a life saving device should your phone not be an option they are out now going today thanks brother,['battery']
456,a an avid hiker and fitness enthusiast i wa drawn to the ultra while the battery life is a key feature for me it is the ruggedness and lightweight body sold it for me i did not preorder at launch a i wanted to try it out and see how it looked it is a big watch and i have skinny wrist but i did not find it to be too big it arrives in two day so excited,['battery']
457,yup my coros pace 2 can do all this and for a fraction of the cost obviously i can not make call or send text or control music from the watch but it can do everything else also it is battery last about 1 week so catch up apple,['battery']
458,to worth that price it need to have solar charging 2 day battery is nothing,['battery']
459,i think the fact you did 6 hour of workout and got 2 full day is what will work for most of the target market anyway is there anything else out there with that quality and size of screen and the gps plus heart and that battery life i would have thought they would have made sure it would work for an ironman triathlon though i get the tradeoff of what is even possible should be enough for 99percent of people and scenario do i want one no not at all but i gave up long distance running a long time ago,['battery']
460,i will stick with my garmin tactix delta just spent the last three day hiking in the rockies using gps tracking on my watch 6 7 hour per day still have 60percent battery life left,['battery']
461,69percent battery nice that is what i am here for well done,['battery']
462,no way you had cellular enabled for that 2 day battery life,['battery']
463,the battery life alone worth the update,['battery']
464,i got the amazfit gtr pro limited edition and the battery life is amazing l9ve it,['battery']
465,i am not mad at this but since i have the 7 i will wait and see what they come with next look like they are paying attention to consumer need but for me i need it to be black definitely expensive but if they learn enough i would bet they nail the next version bigger screen better battery and black,['battery']
466,69percent battery nice,"['battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery', 'battery']"
467,i have de casio protek you show and look and feel better using it apple watch it feel too big square design i will stick with casio never end battery triple sensor,['battery']
468,they will launch another apple watch next year with just the bigger screen and battery and call it the pro,['battery']
469,i get two day from my series 7 i have never thought to worry about the battery life i see people saying a few hour you need a new watch,['battery']
470,just ask yourself is battery the reason why you buy a watch yes the answer is indeed what you are thinking you are an idiot,['battery']
471,epic battery life but the thing is just too big for me,['battery']
472,i would have liked to buy one but it is the shape and battery that kill it for me and make me love my fenix even more common apple 7 10 day battery with 38h gps mode and a shape that doesnt look like a toaster strapped to my wrist and ill buy one,['battery']
473,your airpods have run out of battery is that 1 11,['battery']
474,sleep tracking is basically just heart rate check and recording motion it is not super battery heavy to track sleep,['battery']
475,a much a i like marque review this one of his weakest he is really not giving u the use case scenario for this watch other than it is got a bigger battery cnet went place to show how this thing can integrate in an active lifestyle,['battery']
476,i had 2 different apple watch but i could never get them to match my work out battery life wa not great i invested in a garmin with a week is worth of battery if apple can do a apple watch with a week is battery of course le feature i definitely fall in that outer ring of people that have different need,['battery']
477,hiker battery will not last mtie day with gps no map for navigation from what i have seen endurance athlete can not connect additional external sensor,['battery']
478,doe le than the garmin epix 2 and cost le id say apple nailed the pricing for once hopefully they will step up to the better battery native navigation and ant or at least let you pair external sensor without a 3rd party app in the future otherwise garmin will always have the edge,['battery']
479,lol 2 day battery android watch have 1 week battery,['battery']
480,if people spend big buck for case material and band a well a being part of the apple ecosystem why would not anybody anybody pay for a bigger screen longer battery life bigger control better gps better water resistance etc not just extreme athlete yes the normal watch is fine but we are talking about the apple universe,['battery']
481,wow i just purchased the apple watch 8 i did not think the battery on the ultra would last long enough while in gps mode for long 100 mile bike ride or multi day hike if i had known about the gps battery save mode i might have purchased the ultra,['battery']
482,it would be great if they just make the normal apple watch is battery last more than a day the main reason it will be a long time till i get another one i will stick with my garmin that last 4 5 day,['battery']
483,i just do not get the main appeal they basically make a sport watch my two year old not too of the line sport watch ha nearly all these feature is not a massive and the battery last nearly a week that is with having it on 24 7 and 1 3 hour of training six time a week oh and it cost dollar170 new not dollar800 but oooo apple so i have to get it,['battery']
484,i am not an extreme athlete far from it actually i just happen to do a little of everything the apple watch ultra touch i dive very casually swim way more often i hike and camp occasionally but never too far off a beaten path i also run and ride bike though never in the same day that said i still want the apple watch ultra the battery life is the biggest reason i have held back on getting an apple watch i just do not enjoy having to charge my phone my laptop and my watch every day i have plenty of mechanical watch that i love just having around being able to tell time no matter when i need it it doe not need battery yet get the time down to the second what a beautiful example of engineering but a an it professional i do not get the luxury to be truly on vacation some time i need to monitor my computer even when i am out and about i need to be able to check my email and slack when i am on the beach this is the one thing my mechanical watch can not do my iphone can but it is not ever present like a watch is the apple watch ultra with the battery optimization option is perfect for me i can probably get through the majority of my vacation charging only once midway and i would never need the constant ping for anything health related just a general trend and min max range is plenty now i have an apple watch that is right for me i can dress up my mechanical watch and i will dress down and use the apple watch ultra for casual outing and travel,['battery']
485,can not really compare a casio watch battery to an apple watch battery slight difference in processor power,['battery']
486,why can not apple put a massive 3 day battery in the iphone,['battery']
487,huawei best in smartwatch battery life,['battery']
488,i am not in any of the market classification but that battery life is very pulling i am not a sport person but i do depend on my watch quite a bit for navigation and such and those burn through the battery like nothing only 50dollar difference from my usual 749dollar on top of that not bad at all,['battery']
489,why 800dollar i have xiaomi s1 26 day battery cost just 120 dollar,['battery']
490,speaking about target audience for these watch honestly i just want a regular aw with battery life the same or greater than ultra priced the same or slightly more than regular aw before that happens i am sticking to my garmin despite being a mac and iphone user this show that there are still a lot of people to be convinced despite of what you have drawn on that piece of paper,['battery']
491,you already got 60 hr of battery 2 full day 2 full night into the 3rd day with 20percent left so 24x2 12 60hrs just a thought,['battery']
492,super cool that apple now made a watch that ha a proper battery too bad it is so huge that most people look hilarious when wearing it,['battery']
493,i have just wanted a bigger watch im using 44mm and it is too small for me but idk if 49mm is a big improvement so yeah all those feature would be probably never used by me but i still want to buy ultra for this only reason that it is bigger watch not even a battery life,['battery']
494,i wish it wa possible to make the self winding mechanism in automatic watch charge the battery in smart watch idk if it could generate enough energy but if it could that would be a great way to extend battery life,['battery']
495,2 day battery life in the snowy mountain however is not enough it will drain battery very fast and the screen in bright sunlight is not very readable,['battery']
496,i think you just managed your watch battery terribly my series 3 watch from release date still to this day last me a full day i get it a half ironman is roughly 6 8 hour it should have lasted you longer,['battery']
497,brandon so i just picked up the watch 8 for about 1 2 the price of the ultra with a good case probably get the job done when climbing i ran a marathon last weekend and it still had 50percent battery with ao turned off started at 100percent so about 8h it would have been dead,['battery']
498,cory kroneman true but older garmins do not have all the feature you are going to find on this ultra like anything it is a trade off if you are running ultramarathons you probably know this watch is not for you based solely on the battery life hopefully apple can continue to improve the battery life but like any product it is not for everyone for me a someone who doe a lot of rock climbing and marathon the battery life is suitable for my need i am not running or climbing for 24 straight hour,['battery']
499,this watch will never make it through a full ironman in it current form assuming you are going to be 12h there are quite a few video of people going for 50k run and putting the watch through 8h of gps hr etc and finishing with sub 30percent battery life marathon 1 2 ironman you are good to go 100 mile run is also a no go assuming you are an average runner that will take 24h for a 100 mile run i used the polar m for imwi19 and just made it used both the polar m and a garmin vivoactive 4 for my first 50 miler in october 2020 about 11h run probably 25 30percent battery still remaining this is a great watch but no where near older garmins,['battery']
500,i like how my ancient gear sport still ha the exact same battery life a that new apple watch and yes i am active even though it 5 year old and the battery capacity is not nearly a much a it used to be not to mention it so much smaller,['battery']
501,apple want pro to be the upgraded model that everybody want it is an upgrade with no downside except the price you can not call a watch that is ugly af the pro it is called ultra because it is for people with dollar800 garmin watch who are used to wearing ugly but functional watch i run marathon and garmin watch have better battery life and better spotify integration i have no idea why spotify can not get playlist sync working right with apple watch maybe it is just a problem with background refresh and apple watch before the series 6 could never last a marathon the gps used a ton of battery and even bluetooth streaming used a ton,['battery']
502,2 58 i feel like if this thing ha 2 5 day of battery life with regular use it will not cut it for ultra runner and long distance hiker with contant gps recording no way not even if you triple the battery life with that upcoming feature but of course that is the need of one in a thousand looking great though,['battery']
503,i am glad apple ha a watch that go 2 day plus i mean if it doe not last over a day then it defeat the sleep tracking my active 2 watch is like 2 5 day easily and it ha a pretty small battery but these smartwatches need to be like 2 3 day easily to make them worth using all the feature i think dollar800 is a lot but it doe have a lot of pricey feature but apple is usually overpriced to begin with,['battery']
504,that battery life still kill for most i know in those fringe group they seem to be trying to target i will stick to my fenix that i typically charge up maybe twice a month,"['battery', 'battery']"
505,wow the battery sound so interesting to me,['battery']
506,the apple watch ultra may not have the longest battery life out of other dive watch or workout watch but it sure ha the most feature compared to any other watch the apple watch is amazing and the apple watch ultra seems like it will add even more functionality to make apple watch even more awesome,['battery']
507,all those feature and yet battery life is not great nah will stick to withings with the 30 day battery life and meet all the necessary need,['battery']
508,okay samsung galaxy watch 5 pro next need to know how the battery stack up,['battery']
509,would love to see you do a full head to head against a high end garmin for sport a someone who cycle and run competitively this can not replace my garmin yet but if they can do another 2x battery improvement and allow me to hook up sensor now we are talking,['battery']
510,randall bakken you might be right but 800 dollar watch with only 36 hour battery is a joke,['battery']
511,it is the battery and screen size that sold me if the 8 had that battery amp screen size i would go with the 8 and not the ultra,['battery']
512,apple advertises the ultra for extreme sportsman if i am going for 1 week in the middle of nowhere how on earth can 36 hour of battery be useful another mistake lie is that it is good for 100 mt underwater i have been scuba diving for over 40 year then they correct that for scuba it is only 40 mt it is 100 mt or 40 mt a brutal contradiction my garmin last 12 or more day without recharging and 100 mt depth in ocean that is a real sport watch,['battery']
513,i am definitely not in the target demographic for this watch that said i would still buy it for the battery life alone i hate having to remember to charge my watch every day it would last at least 3 full day for me,['battery']
514,i do not own a single apple product but i still watch nearly every video of you hearing your opinion on new tech is great about watch and battery i have a casio with a 10 year battery which is running for 14 year now so for now i can not imagine getting a watch i need to charge daily also no watch for 800dollar damn,['battery']
515,not good at all i will consider such a device when it will have 2 week battery a band can do 80percent of the apple watch and it last 2 week no need to spend 800usd for a device to charge it daily when it is intended to be worn non stop no hate but still not developed a it should be,['battery']
516,i will wait till the battery life is at garmins level a week between charge would be good,['battery']
517,i still have my garmin saphire solar ha all these apps and more and the battery last a week of full use i want an apple watch but even their premium doe not stand up to other smart watch,['battery']
518,great review well done one thing that you did not mention that is important to me is that the battery is replaceable for dollar99 but otherwise without applecare the cost of any other repair is out of sight i am getting an ultra but despite the fact that it is big and a bit of bling it ha the feature and ruggedness that every smartwatch and the other apple watch should have i own an apple watch 6 gps while functioning a a little iphone on your wrist cellular i have a cardiac condition want 911 calling everywhere longer battery life resistance to high pressure water my sprinkler system when i work on it and supposedly better temperature resistance i will see how it last outside in 106 deg f texas heat i like to go hiking so the more accurate gps under tree cover or in big city where did i park my car etc is a plus too for such an expensive watch it is a shame if it eventually obsoleted by not being upgradeable to a future watchos five year or so would be a pretty limited lifetime for a good watch,['battery']
519,well i do not need a smartwatch but if i really wanted a watch to monitor my workout i would just get a casio under 200euros with a battery life of 2 year in combination with my phone thats just fine but 800euros for a watch i do not get it,['battery']
520,shocking to me apple top smartwatch ha some great feature with the increased size but they sacrifice the battery life a top end smartwatch should have for example garmin top watch speak about battery in length of day not 2 night 2 day if that make sense my current garmin fenix ha not been charged in two day and i have literally 28 day of battery left lol,['battery']
521,69percent battery nice mkbhd 2022,['battery']
522,2 day and 2 night of battery life lmfao that is really not that great,['battery']
523,for me a watch must be something we never want to taken care of but something we can rely upon all the time the real not so smart watch remaining that way for long time it the core of timekeeping there is a lot of people need a smart watch with even long battery life atleast a week how a smart watch becomes smart when it need your attention in every two day it just a wearable health band not a real watch apple can add their pro tag when they found a solution for this problem,['battery']
524,no watch from apple google or samsung will be viable for me until they drastically increase their battery life my tic watch pro 3 ultra get me 5 7 day on a single charge and the competition doe not even come close i wish company would focus on battery life for a change and le on gimmicky feature that i will probably use once and then never touch again,['battery']
525,a teammate of mine brought up a great point for u runner do we want a running endurance watch with smart feature or a smart watch with running endurance feature many of u will still fall in that first category my garmin fenix 5 still ha 7 day of battery despite being almost 5 year old,['battery']
526,would have preferred an apple watch 8 with a better battery life ultra is a niche segment a normal user may not be interested in majority of the ultra feature except battery life,['battery']
527,for yor notice huawei gt watch battery life is one week to two week which you can forget to charge your watch everyday,['battery']
528,why are you comparing the battery life of the ultra to a standard wristwatch like a casio obviously a wristwatch s battery life will last longer,['battery']
529,i use huawei watch gt2 mainly use it for time notification activity monitoring alarm always on heart rate monitoring and sleep monitoring also the phone camera trigger logging every imaginable aspect of my outdoor running controlling the music playback spotify on my phone or computer plus occasionally the other smaller feature of the watch and the battery last 2 week easy if i do not use gps tracking for the workout and turn off the constant heart rate monitoring i bet it could go for a month on a single charge if i would have to charge a smartwatch every 2 day i would not even be using it even more so for a one battery life you could not even monitor your sleep if you had to charge it every night absolute stupidity,['battery']
530,wow a whole 2 day of battery life really guy it is not worth it,['battery']
531,why do you wear your watch on different arm at random point in the day most people wear their watch on one arm left if you are right handed and right if you are left handed couple of time you had it on your left arm my garmin fenix 5x will go for a week on a battery charge i hate apple watch but mostly because i hate apple and i hate square watch,['battery']
532,never would have worn an apple watch the battery is in a word horrendous that said they got me my ultra come on monday,['battery']
533,it is ugly it is expensive it is targeting a niche in a niche and missed the much larger market of people who want long battery life with sleep tracking,['battery']
534,in the intro the airpod battery sound got me,['battery']
535,lol garmin watch 2 week batterylife try harder apple,['battery']
536,i personally like large face watch still love my stainless steel series 4 although old and the battery is not what it used to be this 49mm look awesome to me if you went with aw ultra you better get applecare with this the repair to this watch are insanely expensive also the problem with apple watch and many smart watch is the battery will die even bulge eventually which happened to my original aw1 now apple may replace the battery aka send you a replacement watch for dollar79 or charge you a lot more and charge you far more than the watch is worth trade in is with aw is are abysmal also you may drop dollar399 on a regular aw7 8 and the value of that the following year will plummet 60 70percent older series may be worth 10 buck or apple will give dollar0 00 except the offer for them to recycle it for you will ultra drop 40 60 70percent in value next year a a trade in no idea,['battery']
537,dollar800 and only 2 day battery lol,['battery']
538,two plus day of battery life what i do not need the ultra but i might get it just for the battery life alone,['battery']
539,way too over priced for a watch that doe not even have a 7 day battery,['battery']
540,a an ultra runner and an alpinist i have been waiting for this watch for quite some time i love my series 7 but would have to put it in theater mode to extend the life over my ultras and even then it would die soon after the end of the run i wa about to order a garmin when i got wind that apple wa making a watch for ultra athlete they knocked it out of the park for the ultra athlete with this watch for alpine setting we frequently get an alpine start when summiting a big mountain start around midnight and climb all night to try and catch the sunrise this extended battery life red filter and waypoints are perfect for big mountain the only thing missing which i am sure will make it in the future is the emergency satellite communication that iphone 14 ha,['battery']
541,i went on holiday for 8 night with my garmin venu 2 plus and did not have to charge it once 2 3 day of battery life is not that great,['battery']
542,my amazfit gts 2 mini last 2 week with the same usage my apple watch se the new one last 1 day it is battery life is absolutely horrible,['battery']
543,the reason the apple watch ultra is not reliable a what if you got stuck in a forest while hiking pressed the buzzer so and everything and no help came for 36 48 hour then what how this watch will save your life in some extreme rescue mission people get rescued after day with this watch out of battery good luck with the bear in jungle b this watch specifically say to carry a backup device while diving yeah of course unless they make a watch with at least last up to a week i do not see a point using it a your extreme adventure companion,['battery']
544,ok ummm there are more issue in the video scuba diver will not use that apple watch 100m is not nearly enough for scuba diving not alone saturation diving 200m is like standard minimum for that 100m is for recreational diving or just snorkeling but i would just avoid going into deep on longer period with a 100m watch of any kind with no screw down crown that cost 800dollar uff people are gon na have a bad time with their ultra watch after this video it is really not a pro watch that is why they call it ultra pro name would confuse real professional and they would lose watch in water with low wr or experience battery death 2 day into 5 day hike in wild and what not,['battery']
545,not bad but battery still is not good enough compared to my garmin watch,['battery']
546,i have a series 5 and wa looking to finally upgrade this generation but had no idea there wa an ultra in the work the main reason i preordered it instead of the series 8 is for the longer battery life and how rugged it is i wa looking at garmin too for their super long battery life but i like the lte with the apple watch a that is only available like on one garmin model,['battery']
547,it is an interesting marketing approach for apple but a smart one the extreme end of sport is certainly a clever area in which to hinge a product i guess apple would have always ended up here but a someone that is never bought an apple watch and ha been waiting for the pro rugged version i dunno to me this is something else i wear a g shock have not changed the battery in 10 year and it is nice that you mention the taper of these sort of watch i dig the plastic and the way they shape your wrist they are also indestructible i am not sure what i actually expect apple to do because an apple watch surely doe a lot more than a g shock in term fitness health and feature the ultra still come across a precious to me a sport watch should have way better battery life durability and perhaps a cooler style before it will be on my radar,['battery']
548,just got the iphone 14 pro max and i am glad that my hauwei gt 3 pro watch actually work with it the battery on this thing last a week and it actually look like a watch too plus i do not want to be sucked into the apple ecosystem too much,['battery']
549,it is up against the fenix which ha much stronger exercise feature for cycling my thing and an excellent battery i guess if your thing is diving it is worth a look great first attempt but i will wait for the next iteration,['battery']
550,apple is notorious for great battery efficiency when the product is new be it iphone 13 pro max or the watch or airpods,['battery']
551,do not get me wrong maybe it is good but it is still 800dollar watch thats sick price so they give you crap 7 8 series wont last a day for le and good watch for crazy amount of money so basically they should add something in between le software and better battery it more thick then standard 7 8 material from series 8 size series 8 and the end price would be slightly above standard series 8 and le to ultra,['battery']
552,i have the series 4 and used it everyday including sleep tracking and yes i have to charge it a soon a i get home from work and when i wake up the new low power mode make it last a lot longer which is a bonus especially since the battery health is at 83percent now this new apple watch ultra battery is amazing but also heap more expensive i think apple should improve the battery life for the regular apple watch it would make it more attractive,['battery']
553,bro comparing ordinary watch battery v apple watch battery constantly did not even review essential feature disliked,['battery']
554,not for me i prefer garmin yes the screen is not bright and beautiful but the battery life is great,['battery']
555,this is the video i needed to make up my mind on purchasing the ultra i honestly do not do none of the diving hiking or extreme sport but i am a nurse and ever since covid 19 happened i have been doing 12 to 16 hr shift so having an apple watch that the battery last that long is so helpful due to the longer shift and such i barely got time to make sure that my device are charged so this is perfect,['battery']
556,69percent battery niceee,['battery']
557,no matter how good it is when i go for a weekend camping it take more than 36 hour so to me it is just an useless weight on my wrist it is still a toy for a walk in the local park and yes there are many watch like garmin on the market that are very functional with a decent battery life,['battery']
558,no one is talking about the battery life that is the deal breaker in my case do not want to have ti charge a watch too every other day better off sticking with android smart watch 2 week battery life or garmin 3 to 4 week,['battery']
559,this is the apple watch that people travel internationally need that battery life is great,['battery']
560,did you really need to explicitly compare the battery life of a smartwatch to a normal casio watch just confused about the point of that of course a smart watch is battery is nowhere close to a stopwatch water wet,['battery']
561,i love it but have not worn it yet cause it is not out in store yet for the battery life gt and the siren sound,['battery']
562,yeah the battery would still be an issue for a true exploration that take multiple day,['battery']
563,main reason people do extreme sport and generally not everyday stuff need to have these bulky watch that have button and are not so expensive no need for internet connection on your watch and update etc yes the new apple watch is actually a pretty good watch but when you will get lost in the mountain you wont need only 2 day and 2 night and a third day of battery time,['battery']
564,i wa in that boat with my 5 until he said about the battery,['battery']
565,the battery life is not enough i use an ipad an iphone but my smart watch have been fitbit previously and i have the garmin fenix 6x sapphire for the past 2 and half year 2 week battery life with the ultra battery life it would not be enough for the target map esp hiker and diver where they can be off track for a few day,['battery']
566,review galaxy 5 pro battery,['battery']
567,that battery life is unbelievable i play football and basketball and the way you used your apple watch is exactly how i would a a weekend sport watch amazing,['battery']
568,i am a watch enthusiast and a marathon runner so the industrial design the long battery and the running screen with all the info on at once tip the balance for me will wear it for the london marathon on october 2nd and see how it go,['battery']
569,having 3 day worth of battery i not suitable for hiker and thats without activ gps tracking activate that and this watch is down to hour,['battery']
570,a one of those weird ultra runner people who currently us a garmin fenix these are watch that have 60 hour battery life in all system gps mode plus use on single gps satellite at more than that and an extended battery life mode like you are talking with this watch that go into the hundred of hour and expedition mode which last literally week while still periodically pinging gps i get topo map downloaded natively for free and for doing multi day run hike with gps still left on so i can go back and have fun analyzing all my data i like having way more battery than i need and being able to not think about how much battery i have when i set out a i know that even if i go out for a 10 hour saturday excursion im covered and didnt have to plan out my charging knowing there is that much battery to spare give peace of mind and a the watch and battery age it give that much more buffer before battery degradation make me want to get a new watch this all is cool but if you watch dc rainmaker review he also note that the garmin watch coros etc all have very very detailed training mode and metric calculated in each profile and not just different name applied to basically the same meterics for different sport,['battery']
571,i hike but what grab my attention with this watch is not just for hiking it is the battery life compared to my series 7 and the scratch on the glass and the fragility of the series 7 to have a more solid watch with hopefully a le scratchable screen is very interesting after 6 month my series 7 is quite scratched without using it while climbing or in dangerous for the watch activity it is quite fragile to be honest,['battery']
572,battery life need to last at least 5 day apple should have implemented solar cell to help extend the battery life i am not going to pull the trigger because i still prefer battery life over everything,['battery']
573,for dollar700 battery need to last at least a week for me i hate charging my series 6 everyday so i do not even wear it anymore by now apple should have solar solution for watch still wearing my g shock mtg solar it is 10 yr old i may give it a try and see how it stand up to hunting surf fishing and offshore fishing will come in handy on camping trip hopefully i am not disappointed sorry i mean dollar800,['battery']
574,that battery low sound effect 1 11 gave me anxiety for a second thought it wa my airpods,['battery']
575,honestly mainly interested in this for the battery life especially with the sleep tracking being updated so much right before this release i feel like something that last this long is the only way to get accurate info on that and the ruggedness a well i use my current apple watch to track and it is definitely got some battle scar,['battery']
576,the battery life is a joke huawei is best watch ha a 15 day battery life,['battery']
577,that sound at the beginning had me thinking my airpods battery wa dead,['battery']
578,no way expensive toy fitbit is better with battery life,['battery']
579,i am not an athlete by any mean but i have been looking to upgrade my now over 2 year old series 5 and the more i think about the ultra the more it make sense even for me double the battery life mean theoretically double the battery lifespan plus the crown guard is also super appealing i often have a case on mine not so much for protection but more so to stop me from accidentally pressing it and activating siri whenever i bend my wrist back like when pushing up off something to stand i have pretty dainty wrist though so i definitely need to try and find one in store somewhere to try on,['battery']
580,great review a always i am a marathoner and have been using garmin forerunner 945 whose battery last seven day using gps several time a week for different run workout in addition it allows me to track my cross training apple giving me couple of day just will not cut it so will wait around for next update,['battery']
581,the casio battery to apple watch comparison wa totally nonsense,['battery']
582,did he seriously just compare a smartwatch is battery life to a regular watch is battery life,['battery']
583,first one min is how good is battery can you do after 2 year and see battery life,['battery']
584,not very good battery life for a watch,['battery']
585,i would so buy a series 8 49mm all i want is the bigger battery,['battery']
586,ha so it ha the feature that my galaxy watch from 2020 ha besides the battery life i get 4 to 5 day,['battery']
587,i love my casio a168 battery last 10 year,['battery']
588,being a samsung user no lie i wa like damn i mean they beat sammy to the ultra name lol and finally got a 3 day battery great apps and construction but for dollar800 damn love the dollar100 band be ready to spend a g not me but maybe if samsung actually come out with a better watch still rocking the galaxy gear s3 it is battery construction and usability still work for me,['battery']
589,personally i plan on getting it i am pretty heavy into endurance fitness though i am pretty curious how it will hold up while rock climbing however with that said im sure the series 8 would do just fine mostly i am buying it for the battery life,['battery']
590,i have it now mostly got it for the battery life too but honestly the bigger screen is so much better than my series 5,['battery']
591,most modern smartwatches the battery last day casio solar it doe not even come with a charger,['battery']
592,before i purchased my series 7 graphite i tried a garmin for me apple hit a sweet spot i wa already ready to pay this premium and i wanted something more rugged and had a longer battery i am hoping it arrives before this camping trip this weekend keeping my series 7 for other occasion apple knew exactly what to give u and leave u wanting more it is another apple watch,['battery']
593,made me want to get the watch again had the original apple watch then the series 5 and ended up just never wanting to charge it it would almost always be dead when on my wrist and after updating the firmware the following year it just stopped working all together and while i arranged for apple support to fix it i never sent it to them for repair cause i just never really used it mainly again for low battery performance but your analysis make me interested again a always m b love your thoroughness,['battery']
594,close but still not there for backpacking sure the garmins etc are not a smart but you can go a week in the backcountry without carrying an external power bank and battery tech just is not there yet to match that with this kind of watch maybe once solid state battery hit the market,['battery']
595,it just need 4 full day of battery while using half the time with gps tracker enabled backpacking trip and hunting trip could then fit in this group but garmin is 20 day battery and 5 day with gps enabled is unmatched,['battery']
596,a a hiker 2 day battery life is not good at all garmin is a top tier watch for hiking because it can last longer than a month,['battery']
597,i literally just want the screen size and battery life,['battery']
598,i really wonder if you could make like a dynamo driven automatic smart watch like an automatic watch but with a dynamo recharging the battery of the smart watch giving you some extra battery life maybe even infinite battery life packaging would be a nightmare though,['battery']
599,how many time are we going to hear about you wearing your apple watch to the met gala we get it you went to the met gala i agree with your review it is so interesting of a watch because it ha all these wonderful benefit especially that battery life and all these great feature but it is overkill and i could not see there being another watch the apple would make that would be in between the two watch that would give workout feature and better battery life and remove all the other stuff unfortunately i am sad that the pixel watch will not even match up to the new apple watch it is so much better looking i hate the square look of an apple watch,['battery']
600,it is the size of a dead turtle no wonder the battery last forever,['battery']
601,im getting it for the battery and screen brightness the fact that i get a siren hehehe is just a plus,['battery']
602,samsung get the battery this good cmon,['battery']
603,why ha nobody mentioned the potential for all day battery life for watch only use i want to use my iphone le so being able to go out for the whole day with only my watch and still be able to make and receive call and text is such a bonus,['battery']
604,you showed theater mode being enabled that entire time you talked about the battery life in the intro i am curious what the battery life would be like without compromising on it feature,['battery']
605,im pretty sure the main core feature of the ultra is something that eeeeverrrrybody us longer battery life gt lt,['battery']
606,i have been into big watch before my apple watch and actually wa missing the large size most attractive for me is the extra battery life i constantly get pinged with work message and battery doe not last 16 hour sometimes so i am looking forward to this,['battery']
607,my huwawai watch battery life is 15 day and i brought it 4 year ago just for 140 usd and it is working fine without any issue,['battery']
608,a a dude with no job and a recluse all the extreme extra feature is really not important to me im just getting it for the better battery the brighter screen and the overall bigger watch,['battery']
609,a a garmin fenix 6x pro solar amp apple watch 6 owner i think this standard of the battery must last a month is a bit irrational and overblown for 95percent of people who make that argument and not a feature that most fitness watch user actually use or need case in point how many people complain that their cellphone doe not last a month no one why well that is unrealistic and also because charging your phone is not a big deal why is charging your watch suddenly a big deal not many real world reason it is just a feature that we are used not and not one we actually use first i bet most fitness watch user do not go week without charging their watch secondly it is not much of an inconvenience to charge apple watch once a day or once every couple of day unless you really want to track sleep and even then when you wake up you can put it on the fast charger while you get ready for the next hour then throw it on for the rest of the day thirdly one of the reason why multi week battery life is likely a big deal is because charging most other fitness watch is clumsy and not convenient my garmin fenix 6x pro solar ha a wonky proprietary charger and it is not very convenient to charge so i rarely make the effort to charge it my apple watch on the other hand is super easy to charge with it is magnetic wireless charger so i think this whole battery must last a month is just a talking point rather than a feature that most fitness watch user actually use and when they do it is likely because charging is not easy and intuitive this requirement is like pixel peeping with pro camera doe it actually make a real world difference no it is simple to charge your watch every 1 3 day,['battery']
610,i have had the apple watch suunto 9 baro and currently have the garmin 6x doing the usual mountain stuff in colorado west and the traditional apple watch battery life just did not cut it for my purpose this one is interesting but my garmin 6x get about 9 hard day of daily wear mountain activity can not beat it if i just wore it without working out every day which probably will never happen you could get 10 full day out of a single charge of course the garmin doe not have the same or close feature but for a mountain athlete it crush,['battery']
611,comparing casio is battery life to this watch is battery life given the two watch usage and capability seems a bit unfair and not really relevant when will that casio watch be able do anything in the same way of the ultra other than that really excited about the watch and great review,['battery']
612,what setting did you change on this watch if any so that others can set there is like yours to get good battery life out of their watch i wish i would not have bought the i7 3 month ago and instead waited for this one,['battery']
613,my honor band give me more than two week of battery life and this piece of expensive cake last just 2 day pro,['battery']
614,and yeah that battery life is only just going to make the length of the offshore race i do,['battery']
615,dollar800 and no internet browser apple ha joke and it is selling a phone sized watch with limited capability that are sub par to the price point i will stick with my series 7 apple watch since paying an extra dollar300 for added battery time is not practical at all,['battery']
616,i think the watch is going to be amazing and can not wait for mine to be delivered however i also think there are group of people that this watch applies to that apple kind of forgot about construction worker police officer firefighter wild land firefighter emt is and paramedic tow truck driver and many more all of these individual would benefit from a more rugged and tough apple watch with longer battery life compass and waypoint functionality an emergency siren etc i think there is a large group of everyday people who this watch can cater to not just uber athlete adventurer obviously the price may be a deterrent for some but i think there are many people other than athlete that this watch will appeal to,['battery']
617,if i could get a week out of the watch i would pick it up without having to kill feature or go into battery saving mode garmin tactix 7 pro ha spoiled me,['battery']
618,it is time to see iphone ultra with increased thickness that allows the back of the phone sit flush with the camera lens that will easily give phone the desired battery life usb c with rugged easily replaceable frame eliminating the need for a case,['battery']
619,middle of nowhere for 4 or more day with 36 hour battery useless,['battery']
620,i do not have an apple watch coz it is an additional thing for me to charge maybe once they have longer battery life,['battery']
621,being someone in the military we routinely go on ruck and workout where my apple watch is constantly dying getting triggered by sweat etc this sound like a great improvement for an apple watch i am still not impressed by the battery but i will see how the next generation look in order to warrant purchasing the watch,['battery']
622,for me they need to improve battery life had a series 6 and having to charge pretty much everyday to make sure sleep is tracked is annoying since got a fitbit sense and have all the same feature which actually last me a full week of charge once they get there im in,['battery']
623,what to sell a bigger battery smartwatch they created all that marketing theatrics about ultra user,['battery']
624,then in a year they will push an update to nuke your battery so you have to buy a new one xd,['battery']
625,smart watch battery life or the lack of it have always been a deal breaker for me good to see apple is trying to make it better but a couple of day battery life is still somewhat hot hum though i do not know if there is a setting for watch only mode but that might make it a bit more palatable in my case i do not need all smart function all the time,['battery']
626,garmin venu 2 easily 7 10 day battery life,['battery']
627,my ticwatch pro 3 ultra when apple watch got 3 day battery life rookie number,['battery']
628,i would get this if they get it to 7 10 day battery life currently rock the fenix 7x solar sapphire which is absolutely amazing,['battery']
629,battery life ha kept me from buying an apple watch thus far and so naturally i wa excited for this watch until they announced the price i like it but i can not justify spending dollar800 on a watch one because i do not participate in extreme sport work in construction or anything that might necessitate that kind of design and secondly an ipad would be far more useful for what i do hopefully they will release a lower price version in aluminum but keep the battery capacity and screen size they could drop some of the ultra feature to keep the price down on a side note i get nine 9 day on a charge with my wyze 47c watch but it lack most of the advanced feature of the apple watch,['battery']
630,please list your setting what did your turn off to get that much battery life,['battery']
631,68percent battery if you ask apple,['battery']
632,think im gon na stick with my old 44mm apple watch se cellular more apps than i need and larger battery than the non cellular and last about 2 day got it on sale for le than dollar200 good for those that can afford the ultra have fun,['battery']
633,probably will not get the ultra but mine is a series 4 and i can barely get through a day without line dying i have to keep theatre mode on to save battery i will probably look at getting a series 8,['battery']
634,stoked about that battery life,['battery']
635,if you want something rugged with a lot of battery get a garmin at least 2 week of battery life,['battery']
636,i have given up on smart watch back to good old casio with 10 year battery no hassle of charging no anxiety from erroneous reading of heart rate bp etc,['battery']
637,honestly if apple made an android companion app for their watch to enable thing like calling and texting i would buy one of these it is dollar1500 where i live but it would be worth it for the ruggedness and battery life i often go on long tramp in the mountain for 3 or 4 day sometimes longer no smartwatch until now ha seemed to have a good enough balance of feature ruggedness and battery life for me to consider upgrading from my current solar powered analog watch,['battery']
638,so basically if you just want a cool watch with a bunch of apps for sm navigation or whatever you loose a lot of battery for the stupid health function that constantly spy on your body unless you turn that power saver thing on is not there a usage profile setting kind of thing that doe that anyway and if not why have not the genius at apple added that from day 1,['battery']
639,this is not for fringe people real pro will use specific pro equipment consumer will buy this to feel more pro a marketing tactic but really the appeal is the design the battery and status it stand out and everyone know it is expensive and unique probably will be massive hit with mainstream consumer,['battery']
640,personally i will still take a garmin with a much longer battery life and better map but i do wish it had the same compatibility a apple watch do,['battery']
641,3 day max battery life is rubbish especially for dollar800,['battery']
642,i would love to see a video on all the smart watch that have long battery life,['battery']
643,dear marque appreciate if you can use the ultra with lte connectivity only to have better judgement on how long the battery can last without a mobile thank you,['battery']
644,that red watch face you talk about you can nistall on every wear o watch or garmin or suunto and for le then 800 dollar watch with only 2 day battery,['battery']
645,take a shot for every time marquess ha mentioned wearing an apple watch to the met gala jkjk for real this wa a great review of the the watch and line up with what i expected the biggest pull to the average watch wearer like me is the battery life but with how fast the series 7 and 8 charge the lack of a week long battery life is not so much of a detriment imo i would probably stick to the regular non ultra model despite getting the pro model in all the other category,['battery']
646,they will add an extra 30 min battery life every time they release the replacement model then slimmer by 1mm i will wait 5 year later to get 2 5 hour extra battery life,['battery']
647,this watch is great for me a a chef because there are time when the battery will just run out because i work such long day plus my cake timer and alarm are more visible on the bigger screen and the more waterproof design mean it will not break while i am washing up,['battery']
648,i have seen better battery life on better looking watch for example the amazfit t rex 2 smart watch for a little over 200 dollar will last over a week and a half and look amazing with a few color option,['battery']
649,right but hear me out i literally just love the product design of it and the extra battery is nice worth,['battery']
650,i actually do not care about all the pro feature i just want it because it is a fresh new design and the battery life,['battery']
651,battery and price are the two thing that have stopped me from switching from a fitbit to an apple watch my fitbit can last about a week,['battery']
652,battery life still suck compared to a good sport watch,['battery']
653,i want it for the night time mode battery life and screen brightness in the day i can not dive i stick to popular trail and i only run to the refrigerator but i still want one,['battery']
654,doe the casio have imessage no so obviously you can not really compare the battery like that because the other watch can not do nearly all the thing apple doe without hesitation,['battery']
655,a someone who is into diving aaus scientific diving i am intrigued given what i know about apple watch and battery life i feel like i am veryyyyy skeptical i am assuming most diver will have a backup whether it is another watch or computer built in next to the pressure gauge i can not wait to see how it performs,['battery']
656,i really like the series 7 but the battery suck and you can not find any screen protector for it the ultra fulfills those issue but it look massive all the stuff added to me would seem like bloat wear and the flat screen is not a appealing a the curved that said i think i am still interested just from the battery my 7 is almost always dead before the end of the day which make me not even want to bother with it,['battery']
657,i love the innovative step taken to expand battery life this should push the casual market really well it is a shame we got this review so quickly but no galaxy watch 5 pro mention,['battery']
658,i never liked apple watch because battery life ha been shit on them all i ended up buying an inexpensive watch with 1 week battery life and doe 100percent if what i needed in the apple watch,['battery']
659,having had a galaxy watch for three year i forget that battery life is so bad for the apple watch over and over it is touted that this new apple watch ha such great battery life but it is still not a good a i have come to expect same with ruggedness it is just a non issue with the watch i have three year in basically not even a scratch obviously this is way way better in other way it way more expensive and three year newer but those feature especially feel like just geting to the hygiene level to make it properly reliable to where it is a non issue,['battery']
660,amazing battery upgrade glad i bought one just hope i get it soon 4 to 6 week after unpacked is a long time device should be ready 1 week after unpacked or two day,['battery']
661,this is the only watch i would use a not so easy to break scratch and good battery life although i am not willing to pay for one and battery is not near enough to what i would like so i shall pas,['battery']
662,can you make a video on your setting to get that much battery life,['battery']
663,aside from being a hiker runner and gym rat me this allows people that love going on long walk to leave their phone behind and not fret about lte phone call from the wrist draining precious battery life while tracking workout this is a huge win mine is on the way,"['battery', 'battery']"
664,the battery may be good but my 2 year old fitbit last a week,['battery']
665,i have a pro trek watch a well it is amazing for battery life in the summer i get nervous in winter tho cu we do not see the sun for 5 month lol,['battery']
666,i believe apple will make a pro watch at some point not targeting athlete a the ultra but people that want some extra battery life for example i think they will kill the se and the they will have the watch a baseline pro a bit more expensive with better battery life maybe a more square design and some extra feature and the watch a they have now that would be interesting,['battery']
667,i am one of those people on the outside both professionally and leisurely my polar watch currently the vantage v2 had this kinda battery life and usually even much better for year now granted they do not do stock call whatsapp or anything of that fashion but they are excellent fitness tracker provide a weather forecast and other stuff it is all i need no le and not much more but most important they last sometimes for 8 or 10 day if apple can match that i will buy their watch a well until then it is garmin or polar for me,['battery']
668,the battery life thing is not true my series 3 ha lasted a week without charge on multiple occasion,['battery']
669,getting this for the improved battery and gps that and i have always thought the regular apple watch wa too small,['battery']
670,wr100 doe not mean much you know proper dive watch start from wr200 iso certified and above sapphire is not very durable material yes it is very scratch resistant but it is brittle which is not a thing you want in supposedly rugged watch you want plastic or mineral crystal for such thing the battery is a joke no watch should be charged that often two week is the bare minimum worrying about your damn watch battery dying is just not what those hardcore user want,['battery']
671,i wonder if they will save the pro name for a new tier watch size battery etc of the ultra but le focused towards extreme like the ultra is i would love a bigger brighter longer lasting watch,['battery']
672,battery life is too important for me and the ultra is still super shit at it i will keep my normal huawei one with recharge every 2 week also no offline map unless 3rd party offer that short sighted,['battery']
673,battery life minimum must be 14 day my garmin fenix 6 pro solar hold a least 9 to 13 day,['battery']
674,i thought i wanted this watch but the more i think about it maybe i just want a normal apple watch and then use the extended battery feature,['battery']
675,doe not come close to replacing the sport gps watch the battery life is not good enough for people who run ultra marathon given the name of the watch and the fact they had scott jurek promoting it i find it to be a bit of a joke and a fraud,['battery']
676,those battery stats are based on a brand new device 6 month in it is gon na degrade a hell of a lot,['battery']
677,that battery life on the watch world is very true i bought a digital watch when i wa like 6 for dollar20 i am 22 now and it is still powered up i do not get it lmao,['battery']
678,i for one working at an apple store absolutely have to get it dealing with the possibility of my watch ever going below 80percent battery charge ha given me nightmare for year but nothing will satisfy me more than knowing that i can absolutely flex on my colleague the amount of sim tray ejection tool i could store on the wristband of this refined piece of technology would embarrass every other technical specialist working around me truly a no brainer to spend used car money on something i will never use to it full potential the average person getting the apple watch ultra,['battery']
679,i am still confused by mkb is review of this watch how it sound like he is been asked not to mention garmin in any specific way garmin user will never make the shift here are some reason with garmin watch battery life is measured in week rather than day support for a huge number of sensor unbelievably detailed running and other exercise metric offline garmin map garmin pacepro and popularity map the awesome flashlight the ability to be operated completely using push button should you not want to use touch there is also the availability of specialised watch such a the pilot watch the garmin tactic with applied ballistics and many many more these are just thing that are not supported on the apple watch and will probably never get there off line music garmin pay and sleep tracking need not be mentioned because they are available on the apple watch,['battery']
680,this is the kind of battery that should be expected you got this life out of fitness tracker a few year ago and it is super useful to have,['battery']
681,i use the garmin 6x pro solar and it a great idea to combine a photovoltaic collector with the apple watch it a proven technology and would surely resolve the main problem of apple watch which is battery life,['battery']
682,good video but it make no sense to compare sport watch to a smartwatch like aw with the sportwatch you have an infinite battery but you do not have the multitude of smart thing you can have with an aw mine will arrive on monday ultra version and i will use it for swimming trial motocross running ok i could do the same thing and i did them with my aw7 but i would have to use rugged band to prevent damage with the ultra i would have to overcome this problem we have the satellite connection useful when you go out on an excursion the aforementioned sport watch do not have it i can call the emergency service if i have a problem and i only went out with the watch fenix suunto garmin casio you can not do that so let is not generalize the speech obviously if a child buy it to be a jerk at school then it is completely useless but it wa designed for certain people a bit like the macbook pro many do not need it the air would be enough but they prefer to spend for the power that they will not use,['battery']
683,the ultra is a hard pas for the same price you can get a solar garmin edition for longer battery life topography map and more detailed fitness performance tracking,['battery']
684,yeah exactly garmin suunto and coros user will not be swayed by this i do not think we get way better battery life and way better training tracking feature for le money,['battery']
685,for me except for battery it almost fight with garmin is watch,['battery']
686,i am sorry but for a dollar800 watch that battery is horrible i have a huawei gt2e smart watch which i use for regular training and that battery last about a week and take about 30 min 1 hour to charge the fun part is that everything the apple watch can do so can mine do not be stupid buy a similar clock for dollar600 le than the shit watch ultra,['battery']
687,the only reason i do not have an apple watch is it atrocious battery life a week two is an absolute minimum,['battery']
688,battery life is disgusting smh hopefully apple can figure it out garmin take the cake right now when apple get the battery right we shall see what really is going to piss people off is when apple come out with a better battery life yet this one is only lasting 3 day but thank you apple for finally acknowledging the athlete solar charging is king,['battery']
689,my garmin epix i used for a 100 miler i turned off all the feature and had wrist gesture mode only wore it for 22 hour and had 77percent battery left when i finished,['battery']
690,the battery life will start diminishing after the first week or so when you start wearing your watch from day one of course the watch will last you two day two night that is with all new product so i am afraid your assessment is slightly misleading,['battery']
691,i wish they would just improve the battery for normal watch most people i know that are interested in smart watch myself included just did not wan na charge the watch every night,['battery']
692,i would like to have it just for the battery life alone lol all the extra stuff would just be a bonus,['battery']
693,sorry apple i will be sticking with my garmin until you can match the minimum 2 week battery life i get without battery saver,['battery']
694,the battery life alone is kinda enough to think about getting,['battery']
695,they are going after the long distance endurance sport enthusiast that is why they had scott jurek a a tester it is not competitive with garmin or coros from a battery perspective but otherwise it is a much more usable watch,['battery']
696,the problem is that the battery is going to be le than 2 day after a year so is not really worth at all,['battery']
697,i like how it look i like the size and that it is thicker and the battery i am in,['battery']
698,i did not watch the full video but i got to say something i wish for from 2018 if just apple removed the unnecessary unnecessary unnecessary apps in the watch and left the health apps and improved it and make it last for at least 2 week like the huawei watch i will be the first one to buy it ensha a allah who need to play game on a watch or using unnecessary apps just remove it for the sake of the battery i have been struggling with huawei stupid app and the new watch for what reason i do not know they removed the lock key in the new watch imagine my sister kid always play with my watch when they in my lap entering phone log calling someone or starting exercise why,['battery']
699,went to bed with 69percent battery nice,['battery']
700,i am getting this swapping out my series 3 which is battered and actually got slightly cracked on day 3 of having it brightness is not a huge deal nor is battery but the new flat crystal will hopefully not crack while doing light work at my farm but my watch are proper abused i will admit i do not take them off for virtually anything,['battery']
701,2 5 day of battery life and gbp900 later apple is playing you all like a bunch of schoolboy girl i am sorry i have had an iphone for most of my life but this is just getting ridiculous and silly paying gbp900 for something what only last a few day yet sell itself a the sh t for diving hiking or anything with prolonged period with no charge sound like lack of common sense to me,['battery']
702,a a triathlete i like how apple is finally starting to target u but they are missing a lot of essential feature especially compared to the competition all of the competition ha the ability to connect to 3rd party device such a power meter chest hr monitor cadence meter etc till apple add this ability it doe not do enough for me especially since all the competition ha a much better battery and give you far more advanced stats,['battery']
703,every year i do a portage trip in remote wilderness park ya know it is where we carry the canoe from lake to lake and i brought a dedicated gps device with 1 week of battery life it wa literally dollar600 but it would be nearly impossible to do it without it an apple watch like this would not need too many charge from my power bank and would serve me well with all of it fitness tracking waterproofness and gps stuff and the new emergency gps message system actually is a huge plus in the environment i wa considering buying a dedicated emergency so device for this very purpose but look like i will not need to any more and fyi it is way more popular than you think i can not tell you how over populated it can be even when you are 50 mile into the wilderness park like family with kid and pet are out there a lot,['battery']
704,thats the battery life all apple watch should have,['battery']
705,my smart watch ha 52days battery life in just a single charge and i am still laughing to see that watch which ha almost 3 day seriously who is gon na charge a watch per 3 day that is so annoying,['battery']
706,i do not think wanting reasonable battery life is an extreme use case,['battery']
707,apple still do not beat the huawei watch in battery they are so far a head there p,['battery']
708,i wonder when apple run out of way to make the battery last longer to the point that physic said no you can not anymore will they invent the battery in the band idea that they killed off a start up a few year ago or maybe throw in a small solar panel that would trickle charge it,['battery']
709,let is face it the people that are out of your venn diagram will not buy an apple watch they will keep on using their suunto polar or garmin this watch battery life doe not even get close to my suunto 9 peak the functionality i miss i have them on my iphone for me this is the equivalent of the huge 7 seater suv used to drive kid to soccer or buy your coffee at the drive inn a complete overkill but people inside the venn is diagram will buy it to look cool,['battery']
710,im sure they are saving the pro name for a more regular sized everyday form factor with the battery and screen feature,['battery']
711,i want the titanium case the better battery and i love the look of the watch i do not care about the super duper fitness stuff i do not need those feature but i want the watch and have already pre ordered,['battery']
712,2nd year with my amazfit bip s 23percent after 22 day 30 day average battery life,['battery']
713,2 day battery is a joke a serious athlete will always choose a garmin,['battery']
714,a someone who work in construction the durability alone is a huge draw i can use an apple watch and not worry half a much ive bought it for that alone plus the battery life and fitness feature,['battery']
715,apple definitely could have made more of these shell for the regular apple watch where the only feature upgrade is the bigger battery called it the apple watch max and it would sell incredibly well,['battery']
716,just get a garmin fenix period battery life for a month store music sleep tracking the whole thing and you can get it with a solar charger,['battery']
717,i would only consider this watch if it had a minimum of a week is battery life and 1 4 siren if true that is impressive,['battery']
718,7 day of battery in a smart watch lol you might be waiting 20 year or more the technology is not there,['battery']
719,even mkbhd could not resist saying nice after 69percent battery,['battery']
720,if i were to get it it is for the battery but it is not even the best on the market so maybe not,['battery']
721,the thing that sold me on it wa the titanium case it wa available with the series 7 for a premium price tag also this year the only non aluminum model of the series 8 wa the stainless steel case and that cost dollar750 for the 45mm model for another dollar50 i decided it wa a no brainer to get the ultra and get the added feature and the added battery life no one ha mentioned there is a stainless version series 8 and comparing that with the ultra when it come to feature and price,['battery']
722,why do you switch the wrist you wear the watch i have no need for all the marathon and hiking feature but to spend dollar800 for a bigger and stronger screen with better battery life is a no go,['battery']
723,my garmin fenix 6x pro ha a battery life of 21 day if i just use it a a watch if im using gps navigation it 60 hour apple is getting there somewhat but that touch screen is killing that battery cool feature but impractical for a hardcore endurance watch for someone like me who spends day in the backcountry you need the durability and battery life lot of rock and shit out there in the wild folk,['battery']
724,hey you make the faintest comment towards garmin here but show simple digital watch while doing so i feel you are doing them and your viewer a big disservice have you used one i have the fenix 6 pro from a few year ago and it ha mostly all these feature from the ultra and have done for a few year i am not knocking the ultra it is really cool just the fenix is really cool too so why do not you review them or at least make yourself informed on what other watch are in this field that are similar in price and feature to this ultra the fenix 7 ha better battery ha the dual gps ha the smart gps pinging and more it is not something i take off after a workout appreciate you talking with people who actually use these kind of watch though garmin also ha better biometric tracking than apple fwiw,['battery']
725,use of do not disturb help with battery you had it on during practice,['battery']
726,samsung galaxy watch battery time amp price r better than apple watch,['battery']
727,the aesthetic are terrible and i can not imagine the fitment is any better especially under long sleeve or jacket too much brick even with improvement in battery,['battery']
728,imo i can not justify the upgrade to this thing even though i have a series 5 battery is the biggest issue for me on mine but i am not paying double for an extra day of battery they failed with that and should have offered an ultra lite version in stainless steel for 499,['battery']
729,while i agree with the target audience for this new watch i do not fit it any of them i go running and walking but i am not a marathon runner but the thing that keep making me ping between garmin and apple is the battery life of the garmin the screen visibility in bright light the ruggedness and the battery life i went for a run earlier with my series 7 watch and the curved glass edge made it a nightmare to see in bright light due to the reflection plus i have scratched almost every apple watch i have ever had hoping this new one is the perfect blend for my need which is heavy on the apple integration and ecosystem but with some of the more rugged feature,['battery']
730,great video exactly a you mentioned two day of battery life is kind of bad i have had some pretty cheap huawei smartwatches for over two year now and they still last for 6 day they did 10 day when they were new i do not understand why apple can not do the same,['battery']
731,prior to the apple watch series 0 released in 2015 i wore a limited edition eli manning citizen watch it is a big watch but i never thought it to be too big for my wrist the apple ultra watch is slightly smaller and since i have owned every release of the aw always in stainless i see no reason why i would not purchase the ultra i am a middle to long distance runner the always on screen and the generally larger screen are other compelling reason this watch will be mine the increased battery life without doubt is a bonus i already get nearly 2 full day of battery life out of my current series 7,['battery']
732,just give u a regular or se model that can keep a battery life a long a fitbit smart watch that cost 1 2 the price lol,['battery']
733,90percent of people ive seen with watch like the garmin fenix do not gey use from them the top feture id from them that is actually useful is topo mapping but even then you have limited battery life when it come down to it most hard core adventure type wan na keep tech out of the back county experience,['battery']
734,apple user be like the watch ha great battery that last 3 day and we will gladly pay you 800dollar for it meanwhile you can buy the same thing for 1 4 of the price with battery that last 2 week easy i will never get it for me this is the worst value you can get paying only for the brand it is absolutely ridiculous,['battery']
735,they still need to up battery having to charge every 2 day is a no go for me and even sooner if you use the function more i will stick with my garmin,['battery']
736,i paid more just for titanium in the series 6 this is a no brainer for le price and way more feature including battery life which help all type of user,['battery']
737,i am a standard guy no ultra sport here but i like big watch and increased battery life is enough for me to go with ultra on top of that why i should pay the same for series 8 cellular when ultra cost the same with ton of feature more doubled battery life,['battery']
738,could apple possibly be saving the pro name for the non extreme athlete user i would still love a sapphire glass better battery brighter screen but do not need much else from the ultra,['battery']
739,imo this watch is trying to capture more of the men is watch market the design is catered to the men is market i know many men and i am one who still do not wear a smart watch because of concern about durability battery life size and feature my watch for backpacking climbing etc is a casio pro trek like the one you showed with an altimeter compass and solar charging my daily watch is a seiko solar chronometer both never need charging are rated water resistant to 100m static pressure and tell me what i need to know both are about 1 3 the price of this and are much higher performing in the way that matter to me,['battery']
740,the apple watch ultra is on my radar simply because of it battery life brightness and action button assignment i would highly prefer a black version of this for reason stated in the video,['battery']
741,using the airpods low battery sound in the intro threw me for a loop lmao,['battery']
742,in 6 month and 3 update the watch will do 5 hour battery and get hot just in time for the next dollar900 version next year,['battery']
743,i am absolutely the audience for this i am a qualified diver recreational and technical a fairly regular hiker mountain biker multi day wilderness trekker and a regular runner gym goer prior to this the only realistic option for people like me to have an all in one device wa the garmin descent mkii google the price though and look at how dated it already look and you might see why i have not made the leap just yet from my current combination of garmin fenix 6 and a basic mare recreational dive computer in reality most of my dive are usually single cylinder recreational dive and this is the case for most tech diver i have come across for a number of reason that go well beyond this post this aw is therefore a really tempting option for me a for anything technical i have two separate computer anyway the one other major hassle this would solve would be the constant changing between watch on the boat before after kitting up taking kit off pre and post dive it doe not sound like a big problem but dive boat are busy place with heavy equipment knocking around so every time i take my fenix off i always have to worry about it being either lost or broken not an issue if you never have to change watch in the first place regarding trekking i wa worried about the battery life initially but in reality i only get about three or four day of battery including tracking storm alert etc from my garmin when outdoors anyway despite the amazing standby of around 2 week i and most trekker i meet these day tend to a carry battery pack s anyway so the battery life is not really a huge problem with the performance that marque is seeing all in all i am seriously considering this a my first apple watch a day i thought would never come,['battery']
744,i really do not get why it is still getting compared with garmin my 955 almost half the price last more than 10 day with 6 of them being active around 13 15 hour in total of gps on the super extra gps setting and sleep tracking it ha an amount of sport that i would not do in my entire life ha some insane algorithm and training data and it is so light i do not even feel i am wearing it i get that it is a cool product for apple but in my opinion it is just incomparable with garmin i mean garmin ha some watch that their battery would last almost forever with that being said you are a legend mate keep up the awesome work,['battery']
745,the whole thing is just another apple gimmick the 99percent of people who will buy this are buying it for the battery life and because it is something new from apple they could have just upgraded the standard apple watch with the feature that 99percent of people buying this want,['battery']
746,i feel that the battery life is not enough i have a garmin fenix 7 and it last me a week without charging such a great experience,['battery']
747,crap battery life compared to coros garmin other fitness watch,['battery']
748,quite a comprehensive review of the new apple watch ultra i am interested in purchasing it due to the enhanced battery life and ruggedized construction i do hope that apple doe not upgrade the apple watch ultra every year a they do with the standard apple watch,['battery']
749,why do not they curve the underside of the watch kind of easy to do if you have several size and add a huge amount of comfort and battery space,['battery']
750,the nice on 69percent of battery got me,['battery']
751,i just use a mechanical watch and never have to worry about battery,['battery']
752,i wish it had a battery for like 4 5 day just to keep up with other fitness tracker,['battery']
753,i know that garmin watch have 6 7 day of battery power so this pro watch is nothing special,['battery']
754,i am curious to get this one a well i have a series 4 the battery ha degraded down to 75percent and sometimes deloads it charge overnight i like the orange accent and the size of the watch and some of the watch face infographics i am not that active but the price of the ultra is barely more than a stainless steel watch which people get all the time otherwise they would not even offer it to me it is not that absurdly expensive for a watch that last 4 year or more,['battery']
755,do you need an iphone to make it work or can you use it with an ipad our like someone else is friend parent iphone hmm weird question but i am not sure i am able to choose between this an samsung watch or an withings watch a someone looking for long battery life sleep and heartrate tracking,['battery']
756,my issue with apple watch series 7 cellular is battery life if you do not want to bring your phone somewhere for a few hour and you are taking call streaming music etc i am not always getting to the end of the day on a single charge and i think releasing yourself from your phone and only using the watch on cellular is the huge selling point of even having the watch,['battery']
757,i mostly only upgraded because of the battery after a year of battery degradation the battery on the apple watch wa already getting too close by the end of the day and the apple watch is not a device i will be upgrading every year more like every 3 or 4 year so the le often i need to pay to have the battery replaced the better with how i use the current apple watch i wa annoyed with having to recharge it in the same day for it to comfortably last before i went to bed which left no room for sleep tracking or just made doing so an inconvenience i like the idea that i will probably only have to charge the ultra while i am showering to ensure it never dy,['battery']
758,trading in my series 5 gold stainless for a series 8 gold stainless and also getting the ultra series 8 will be my dress up watch and the ultra i will wear pretty much all the time not into the extreme activity shown for the watch i just like the aesthetic longer battery life brightness and ruggedness i think there are more people like me out there than apple think there are who will get this watch,['battery']
759,i want one of these just for the battery life there have been time when i have had to take the series 6 off and put it on the charger a couple hour before bed far earlier than i normally would just because i happened to work out for an extra hour or so that day i do not even use it for sleep tracking i wear it from about 8am to about midnight do a 2 3 hour workout in there somewhere if i am not being lazy and it is usually down to around 10 15percent by the end of the day i also avoid using the cellular feature or even having it away from my phone ever to avoid the cellular antenna turning on,['battery']
760,man that battery life is sounding almost like a garmin,['battery']
761,a an amature runner and hiker the garmin is battery is crucial and everything lasting a day and a half like the previous watch is a no go with everything in the apple ecosystem an apple smartwatch is a huge attraction my one gripe and the reason i will not buy it right now it is a rectangle,['battery']
762,my 5 6 year old samsung gear s3 frontier is black and none of the color is peeled and i still after all this time get two day plus of battery life original battery imagine that,['battery']
763,look great but i think im gon na keep my series 7 for awhile my series 2 lasted like 6 year till the battery started dying quickly,['battery']
764,i honestly have to say that i am excited for mine to come on friday even though i am not an extreme outdoors athlete or trainer i do go walking hiking almost every day and find that the improved battery life of the ultra with it extended battery life mode coming later this year to be enough of a reason to upgrade also a marque put it this is basically a pro model that offer feature that more avid hardcore user of the apple watch can appreciate all of the new upgraded hardware feature of too bad that there is not a slightly better processor than the series 8 or se 2 built in but hey for the first time ever in the apple watch is 7 year history this edition actually ha more going for it for the price than just the outer casing which when compared to the series 7 edition is that much more of a bargain for the price i will be doing my own first impression unboxing when i get mine friday but i already know that barring some major unforeseen flaw or regret i plan to keep this until at least next year when we see if how apple evolves this new line of apple watch,['battery']
765,huawei is on another level for dollar500 i have a fully titanium watch and strap sapphire face with 14 day of battery life or 8 day of heavy use with all the same sensor workout tracking sleep tracking etc and it look classy or go with the older version for dollar200 and get the same thing with just slightly worse interface,['battery']
766,i am grabbing it for the battery screen size and ruggedness i love my apple watch and it is been to hell and back with me and is pretty worse for the wear because of it here is hoping the ultra hold up much better,['battery']
767,i want dollar300 dollar400 apple watch that ha a week long battery life i currently use a cheap dollar50 smart watch which get two week of battery life so i do not think it is too much to ask for lol,['battery']
768,it is an expensive woman repeller if it were not and looked anywhere presentable at a dinner or a party it would be worth it just for the extra battery it would just last longer and pay for itself they should have still kept the regular titanium option for people who wanted sapphire glass but not the weight of steel and were still into getting as,['battery']
769,marque 69percent battery nice,['battery']
770,good honest review feel like the sensible me ha just said nope you do not need it so i will live in hope of some low power apple fitness band with 5 day battery the market is there apple you just need to get to and get it,['battery']
771,apple hasnt thought of another group of user like me cheapskate i use a dollar50 smartwatch with battery that last more than a month amazfit bip,['battery']
772,so according to apple that all the one outside of your illustration circle are all male you are lucky you are a male this watch really suck for small boned small wristed female i would like to take a watch on an extended hike not unite a pct or other through hike but segment when i can afford the time to go so a a woman i have to settle for a gps watch that doe not have the accuracy and the battery life apple really need to hire more woman in product design curtis machale talk about this in one of his video on a book review about how item are mostly designed for men and that woman just have to be subjected to crap like this even those other watch you have shown i have seen model for woman,['battery']
773,fun fact i have casio watch that my brother got for his 7th birthday he is now 22 year old and the watch is still running on the same battery it came with,['battery']
774,amazfit gtr2 7 day battery,['battery']
775,garmin watch battery last a week,['battery']
776,i do not do any of the advertise usage for this watch yet i still bought one because i personally like the new flat screen look and the bigger battery is also a plus for me,['battery']
777,let is just buy it for battery life,['battery']
778,i hate the smart watch from apple and samsung i wear 2 watch currenly 1 2 88 inch full android one which is basically a full tiny smartphone that need to be chrarged every night and a cheaper one one my other wrist that last well over a week on a charge for health tracking i would like to get one that would be somewhere in the middle with functionality and battery life but no one make anything i would even concider for any price,['battery']
779,wait you compared a normal watch to a smart watch for battery life that doe not make sense,['battery']
780,i believe that serious sporty person those who are not going outdoors just for the pic will go with better more specialized and obviously with better battery choice such a garmin sunto etc,['battery']
781,wow 2 day few year ago huawei released their watch watch with 2 week of battery life with same feature ant cost 4 time lower american,['battery']
782,why is nobody asking why apple watch chipset is not more energy efficient adding more battery and bulk isn the way,['battery']
783,a a skier this product seems very appealing being to go to the mountain and go into 10 degree weather without any worry seems very appealing a well a going camping for a multiday weekend and not needing to worry about the battery life,['battery']
784,bad battery if you compare to even some 200dollar watch,['battery']
785,i am a serious hiker backpacker and i still do not see this a a good sell for people like me dollar800 for the thing and needing to charge it every 2 day is just a dead weight in my backpack once it dy i would rather bring my phone and use gaia gps for navigation and have a backup real map and compass for navigation if my phone dy which lead me to my next point i would want my phone charger to power just my phone and recharge my garmin inreach which would actually be useful in an so situation something the ultra doe not do i think if apple added the so function the way they did on the iphone 14 it would make it somehow more useful but first and foremost is battery life which would need to be improved for going on multi day adventure,['battery']
786,still garmins last for week if not month on battery like if i would be into so demending sport or working in rough environment garmin it is just a better choice,['battery']
787,like most i stare at my damn phone way too much a much a i try to minimize my usage the temptation is often too much to overcome this is why i love my cellular apple watch leaving my phone behind make it impossible to go down a rabbit hole and force me to be present i look at all the people at the gym staring at their phone instead of working out and realize i would be just like them without it the battery put the brake on that pretty quick and the screen size mean you are left squinting though this watch fix all of that for me,['battery']
788,well i am a wheelchair patient so i do not do activity like hiking or diving etc but there are still some nice feature that this bigger apple watch ultra ha that appeal to me especially the bigger battery life since i can get longer out of this watch for my heart rate measuring it ha a nice big screen which i also really like i do like the orange color of the button a well though i also wish it would just come in black now a a fashion jewel i must say there are still big watch that people wear and go on special event on with and even though these watch are mostly truly jewel rolex they are also big if you wear the apple watch ultra you could use a more muted band maybe some type of off white or something like that which would color match the awu i think i might get this watch i am not completely sure yet the price is also something to consider a in my country the awu cost dollar1k,['battery']
789,battery life is the only reason i want own one i never take a watch off,['battery']
790,i do not run swim or hike i just want a bigger watch face and longer battery life over my series 5 that last 16 hors max getting my ultra this friday,['battery']
791,69 percent battery markass nice,['battery']
792,i just wish my watch 3 battery wa not expanding apple bud that pretty well while they were still selling it,['battery']
793,i did not know that apple watch had such horrible battery life before this video the fact that two day is great is kinda sad a someone who wear a mifit 5 band for two week straight before washing it and charging it i find that anything larger than a bracelet and without at least a week of battery life would be too cumbersome the only feature that i feel like i am missing nfc and being able food to a calorie tracker or starting ending a fast for me apple watch a it is already have a narrow appeal a they only attract apple user who do not have good comparability option having to constantly take it off and recharge at best every two day brings down from being a watch to another electric device to babysit i always thought people bought them becouse they had good feature i guess not lmfao,['battery']
794,i feel like a large segment i fall into is missing people that cycle loooooong distance i ride century frequently and even though i may use a dedicated bike computer for speed cadence and the like i still use my apple watch for heart rate zone monitoring and calorie counting i can not make it through a full century without charging my watch i am upgrading my old series 4 to the ultra specifically for the battery life and gps a it relates to long distance cycling,['battery']
795,charged my garmin fenix 6 pro x about a week ago 11 day left exercised and or cycled every day with gps and heart rate transmit feature on i upgraded from an other garmin a a 3 day battery on a watch is unacceptable for me just my 2c i use about zero smart watch feature other than exercise and health tracking also my last watch had touch worst thing for a sport you do in glove and rain and mud,['battery']
796,also the lack of ant support is a big issue for bikers e bikers you can not transmit heart rate or talk to speed cadence or e bike sensor either nor ant ant enabled gym machine generally i saw a similar response to mine on every bike video on this watch it is nice if you ride once a week if you want 24 7 tracking and long battery and ant support then this would work a a 2nd watch for office day or hanging out i understand why people like it and i want one too the problem is that it would end up in the drawer next to the other gadget i wanted then replaced with others that i needed,['battery']
797,i am an average college student at purdue university so my apple watch series 4 ha been great for my need i play disc golf on the purdue team and waypoints could be game changing being able to set them during a practice round will allow me to see where the basket is on blind tee shot see where my shot ending up in the past and have a better idea of the course the ability to measure how far my throw using waypoints is also super helpful information for consistency all this with a brighter screen and longer battery life wa hard to ignore i wa excited before watching your review but now i can not wait,['battery']
798,unless these become compatible with regular magsafe it is not worth it to me i also feel like watch should have a week worth of battery i can not take measuring a watch is life in hour that being said this is coming from someone who is iphone 13 pro is at 93percent battery capacity so i am probably a worst case user,['battery']
799,i liked the last plugin about the mkbhd i am only worried about the size of it which is crucial for the battery life but may hinder day to day activity i suppose,['battery']
800,a a pilot the red filter for night flight is a massive upgrade in it self the brighter screen and better battery life is only the cherry on top of the cake ez decision even if it will never be used for any hardcore stuff,['battery']
801,so doe a 2 day plus battery to do 98percent of the regular stuff an se can do worth the price especially when you are most likely gon na end up at home with enough time to recharge,['battery']
802,you should try the huawei watch i get 5 day of battery time easy one mine it go up to 20 if i go eco with it,['battery']
803,wowzerz a whole 2 day on battery lol,['battery']
804,people will only buy this for the better battery life alone,['battery']
805,i have no intent in using the ultra for these crazy activity i just like the look size battery and screen brightness so i ordered one,['battery']
806,this fucking enormously ugly watch ha a long battery life no shit,['battery']
807,why do you keep doing this you talked about garmin and other watch lasting forever and then you compared this against the most basic screen in the market this is pure marketing why do not you show a garmin epix 2 that can last 2 3 week in regular mode and even more in battery save mode i mean it ha a touch screen topographic map and multiple gps system if you go camping 2 day of battery is nothing and if you use gps that battery consumption will shrink to most likely 5 hour max you might have power bank for essential and watch is not essential this is a first attempt to get closer to the ultra smart watch not the casio you showed is not close and a of now is good for regular user in their daily basis you are really forcing this idea,['battery']
808,how many homekit accessory do you have in your network i noticed that homekit is quite extensively killing battery on apple watch,['battery']
809,i am heart patient and i have seizure ecg and irregular heart rhythm detector wa pretty helpful to track on my heart beat even though it doe not detect hear attack but fall detection wa pretty helpful bc when i had huge fall during my seizure it sends my location to emergency contact but my series 7 watch got scratched during the episode just one scratch in middle of the screen and it bother me i use most of the feature in my watch so apple releasing a watch with extended battery and ruggedness is pretty helpful but in canada cost dollar1099 tax but it feel like it is worth it,['battery']
810,i think it need significan notly better battery life offline mapping and more comprehensive fitness focused metric to be a true competitor,['battery']
811,garmin measure their battery life in month not hour,['battery']
812,so marcus you are percent100 wrong a black titanium watch dose not scratch easy i have got a series 5 apple watch edition space black that i have been wearing daily a of tomorrow 3 year and it still doe not have a single scratch on the case the screen ha one very faint scratch that can be seen in bright light the battery is at percent85 i am hearing impaired and use it a an alarm clock so i wear it about 23 hour a day i have been wearing a apple watch since the series 23 hour a day i charge in the morning when i shower and when i come home when i am relaxing at the end of my day i am not happy that they discontinued the edition a i wa planning on buying a new one this year,['battery']
813,even though i have not been an apple fan lately and yes i do have iphone and ipad even though apple doe not do a much a samsung doe i will say apple watch is not better than samsung but apple watch are really good i have an apple watch and it work amazing and battery life is really good a well but i think it is because u can not really and much to it i have apple watch 6 and will not be upgrading,['battery']
814,a garmin fenix ha an entire map of the united state with a 2 week battery life if im hardcore i would just buy that a bunch of waypoints are not useful,['battery']
815,aesthetic do not matter to those who are relying on the watch for what it doe v what it look like a an avid hiker that ha had the apple watch battery die on long hike this is a no brainer,['battery']
816,it is a powerhungry computer that is not really rugged that ha a poor battery which still can not sync to the ipad,['battery']
817,watch is for an urban hiker not a real one day battery life,['battery']
818,sleep with about 69percent of battery nice,['battery']
819,just fyi you can buy a dollar20 casio with a 10 year battery life at walmart kinda bugged me when he wa talk about better watch having better battery life better watch do not use a battery and use a kinetic mechanism to power the watch,['battery']
820,i run ultra marathon and i still got a garmin forerunner instead the battery life for this may still not be enough for me not to mention all the other accessory you can connect with garmin for exercise the garmin ha 48 hour of battery in gps mode and week of a charge in smart watch mode i currently have the apple watch series 4 a well i am looking to break a little more from the apple walled garden,['battery']
821,i do not like having a case to prevent scratch i know what you about the playground issue i need a better battery and etc because i like to sleep with watch on honestly i just like deep dive aspect of it because i do not trust the whole water resistant sale point,['battery']
822,my xioami wrist band ha everything i need and the battery last 2 week,['battery']
823,alright i loved the paper and people drawing but even i can not be the triathlon guy or whatever but i think that anyone on those ring that you draw everyone want good battery life and i am not using always on and i also disable background app refresh on my apple watch i am sure that i can get a lot with the ultra i am using series 5 a bit old now and over time with all the feature turn down like i have said i can do a day like 24h period and if i have like someone calling me like let is do a party or something or just hanging out late i know that i need ultra time to recharge my serie 5 and think about that throughout my day i just want the battery from the ultra or near well i know that the serie 7 or 8 battery are way better tho i do not know,['battery']
824,this is the best with the red light battery sat connectivity 100 meter 2000nitts i mean this is the best,['battery']
825,800 dollar with 72 hour of battery,['battery']
826,apple is not targeting the niche population that actually need such extreme feature the battery life alone discourages enthusiast from even considering the watch the one who will buy these are the normies who will appreciate the peace of mind from better water resistance more rugged construction brighter screen etc,['battery']
827,but it is still dollar800 and for that the battery life is not there make it solar and i will consider it it need a way to changing itself if you are outdoors or lost,['battery']
828,apple watch ultra v g shock apple watch battery measured in day the casio in year apple watch shock and water resistant casio is tank and missile resistant apple watch will last up to 5 year casio 5 decade maybe more apple watch 799dollar casio g shock pro trek with the same feature about 300dollar,['battery']
829,my galaxy watch sometimes last an entire week usually 5 day why is apple battery life so bad in their watch,['battery']
830,i do not get why i see a lot of people say if you buy this your basically being a tool or like a very showy type of person in my opinion it look awesome and it ha that extra battery i do not think you really have to be an extreme athlete to be able to rock this just the battery alone make it worth it for the average person,['battery']
831,i would not normally need that kind of watch but battery is the key i only do 1 2h run with gps tracking and cellular apple music via airpods this is too much for my se even with 98percent capacity i need at least 80percent battery to hope the watch would last the whole run with le battery it pretty much always die,['battery']
832,the reason i do not use apple watch is the battery is trash 7 day or gtfo for this price id like even more but they decided function over battery id prefer simpler device with more battery life,['battery']
833,i am a professional diver meaning i make my living scuba diving and carry liability insurance i wa excited to hear apple wa making a watch that had diving capability but after looking at all the spec for this i got ta say they missed the mark for your once a year recreational diver it is fine i guess but for a professional it is still under par let me explain 1 yes it is missing air integration meaning i can not see my tank pressure from the computer and that to me is the most basic function of current dive computer 2 no depth gauge below 40 meter is no problem for rex diver but a a rebreather instructor i want a dive computer that will go a deep a i plan which could be 250ft 3 battery life is still sad my sherwater teric can go for well over a week not a dealbreaker but still is a disappointment 4 but for me the main concern i have is that it is an app most dive computer that is all they do calculate important info to keep you safe but i am trusting an app on a watch that wa not solely made for diving and to top it all off you have to pay a monthly subscription fee just to use the app that is just dumb i get that it is a watch that doe a lot and im glad they are making an effort but when it come to my safety and access to info i think i would stick to my teric for now but who know for the future,['battery']
834,good for apple finally getting the battery upgraded although garmin still owns them in that aspect and most fitness need,['battery']
835,so the only thing holding me back from faulting the apple watch ha been the disgustingly horrendous battery life and the ultra with it improved but still absolutely terrible battery is still not nearly enough all fitbit watch easily 4 7 day and generally have superior health and fitness tracking on the higher end model to the compared to the regular apple watch at half the price my current huawei watch get about 9 12 day with all of the same feature,['battery']
836,im sorry but the battery isnt close to what garmin is bringing to the table,['battery']
837,still not really an ultra watch though is it especially with mediocre battery life and no map great smartwatch though,['battery']
838,69 percent battery nice,"['battery', 'battery']"
839,i run a lot and hike and bike and work a a certified arborist but i also have small wrist this look huge on you and i am definitely not a tall a you if they made this in two size i would jump on it the battery life is what keep me using my garmin for those 100mi ride day i will stick with my titanium aw7 and wait until they can fit this much battery in a 41mm watch thanks for the review and multiple angle of the watch,['battery']
840,haha you name drop met gala nice review indeed a regular watch shape may give more battery space,['battery']
841,they could give this much battery life in ultra they can give it for the same in other model is to mention they will not,['battery']
842,last year i ran a half ironman and the battery died le than halfway through the race while using a series 3 yes i know it wa not the newest one out so i switched over to garmin forerunner 945 but i do miss the apple ecosystem i signed up for a full distance ironman and am racing soon i wonder if i wa to do this race if during gps mode where it track all of the stats like hr zone cadence respiration speed etc if the new apple watch could keep up with the garmin battery life i only charge my garmin maybe once a week and charge it when it get le than 20percent battery i feel it would be hard for the apple watch to keep up with garmin for ironman triathalons in term of battery life and feature what do you guy think,['battery']
843,the watch is battery can last for longer period of time it can handle extreme temperature water restiant comfortable on wrist and suprisingly longer than it look it make it easy for scuba diver to track live depth in the ocean the temperature of the water surrounding them it is great for mountain climber it can stay on say they knocked off or slip they can track their way back to a starting point if the they got lost it is especially in my opinion for runner and trainer it work like another stopwatch but can track your heart rate measure the amount of caloreis that you have burned after training and stay on your wrist while you run something that have i have kind of noticed is that the watch ha basic mobile apps meaning you can kind of treat it a thought it is a phone on your wrist one hundred percent worth the money for the people that regularly do these thing not really for everyday use but not bad for it either,['battery']
844,it still can not compete with the true fitness watch for marathon runner and trail runner it is just not even close enough to consider honestly i think to most of u in that bucket they tried and fell short the ultra name made it seem it wa for u but then it did not do enough they just need to be better battery wise,['battery']
845,the thing that disappoints me with most modern technology now is it is short shelf life due to software you are basically buying a product to last you 5 year max when either the battery will diminish drastically or software will no longer work or both,['battery']
846,increased battery life on mobile tech will grab anyone is attention but if people really think about it their battery life is not a problem,['battery']
847,2 and a half day battery life is not that impressive,['battery']
848,i want to see these type of review a year into the usage of this watch what doe the battery time look like then are you recharging every day or did it still let you go two day,['battery']
849,i still have an apple watch 5 and can go a full day and sometimes through the night a well without charging after 3 year battery life ha barely dropped over that time,['battery']
850,you can spend more on a stainless steel one with worse battery life so it is definitely worth it a larger screen a well,['battery']
851,69percent battery nice lmao this man,['battery']
852,i will get an apple watch when they have 25 day off battery,['battery']
853,69 percent battery nice ha,['battery']
854,outdoor watch with 2day battery life what a joke,['battery']
855,shitpple im tired charging series7 every night give u 5 day battery life on ultra at least at those money,['battery']
856,i still like garmin for it battery map and load of tracking info on it app,['battery']
857,the reason why i have never felt like replacing my galaxy watch active 2 is because the battery marque is describing is average on my watch the idea of a watch dying every day sound awful,['battery']
858,for that price i would still go with the garmin fenix it give you about 4 week battery life,['battery']
859,well spending this much money on a device that can not get it battery replaced even by apple technician,['battery']
860,i would compare this watch to an analogue dive watch in that most people will not use the core functionality however i would say there are some good looking benefit that people could want this watch for outside of the hardcore user i e people who want the best battery life even if that is just for normal functionality to name one of many potential pull factor for normal people wanting to buy this watch,['battery']
861,not gon na fly for real pro user until battery will be at least a week hiker want to worry last about their watch dying mid trip yes they introduced low power mode and that will be longer but with the cost of cutting off feautres so whats the point then to get 1000 watch this watch seems like very weird choice pro people will stick to their garmins maybe for diving thats fine i realy lliked the ruggedness of the watch but paying 1000 buck for feautures that i wont ever use seems stupid another thing if they would introduce rugged version of regular series 8 for le price,['battery']
862,jerry will have the last word on actual durability and how real the sapphire is of course haha but after watching the review and people is comment now is clearer than ever that the market for this watch is basically everyone but polar is garmin is which were the company everybody saw dying suddenly after the ultra is release it is a nice addition to the market but the bulk of that market will be people wanting an apple watch with decent battery life because the average smartwatch ha horrendous battery and that is ok,['battery']
863,i just want the battery life because i hate charging my battery everyday,['battery']
864,garmin watch are the best in the market longest battery precision at affordable price check them out i have been using a fenix 6x pro last half a month no problem,['battery']
865,i can come up with nearly any number of us excuse for buying this but i do not have dollar800 lying around after i bought the 14 pro i also feel certain there will be some new feature for the aw9 ultra about a year from now i like the serious hiker excuse we all know how they drag usb battery around with a bag of cable for all their gadget and the special wax and bone comb for the beard or not,['battery']
866,what happened to u we are praising 3 day of a watch battery when we used to have watch that take year before we change the battery,['battery']
867,i own an aw s4 and an older garmin and i am in the market for a new sport watch to replace at least the garmin i would never buy the ultra it is simply too much of a compromise on battery life the ultra delivers the same battery life in power save mode a similarly priced competitor do in high accuracy gps tracking it also relies too heavily on touch input which is garbage in anything other than sunny cali,['battery']
868,i love the watch but like samsungs pro not the price my now 2yr old dollar100 refurbished amazon gear s3 frontier ha been great for me i love the larger type watch amp i wear mine in saltwater while fishing the texas coast amp not a single issue i still get 2 day battery but i just put it on charge at night when i go to bed can not beat a dollar100 refurbished gear s3,['battery']
869,these with a month battery life they are not computer let is be honest here you kinda comparing old dump nokia to smartphone battery life,['battery']
870,ngl that thing is pretty ugly i do not really see a use case for this the average consumer definitely shouldnt get this one but i do not see why an porofessional should get this either the only possible person i think can buy this are people who love gimmiks and or at least want to look like they do some extreme stuff but once you for example go hiking for more then 2 day your battery is empty when you climb some hill the watchwill still get great scratch apple doesnt want you to use screen protector sooo sorry for my bad english but still in my opinion there is no actual use for it maybe actually just people want to show off that they can afford the most expensive apple stuff,['battery']
871,if apple really wanted this watch to live up to the name ultra why did not they put a solar powered battery in it designer watch like citizen and movado use solar power battery why not an apple watch apple is all about protecting the environment and at least this way they can remove another item from the box,['battery']
872,im waiting for it to arrive in november i would say that the battery is the main reason i bought it and oh man i wished it wa in black,['battery']
873,it can never touch even the garmin sq 2 for battery life and everything,['battery']
874,that battery life sound like my galaxy watch 4 classic battery life,['battery']
875,why casio watch is compared for battery life with apple watch it is not a fair comparison,['battery']
876,can you make a smaller ultra of 47mm made of aluminum cellular with the same battery for 699 you can call it apple watch max and you can take my money also,['battery']
877,the main reason i want this apple watch ultra and never got a reg one is because of the battery and the size i am a big guy and the reg apple watch looked like a kid watch on me so i hated it can not wait to go size it at apple store,['battery']
878,a someone who doe like to track a number of metric for running and cycling i had a garmin fenix way before an apple watch i still prefer it for run and cycling not in the least because of battery life on the apple watch once any sort of continued measuring is going on i also sometimes go diving price wise a diving computer my fenix and the watch which i prefer for body metric and integration with my other apple product easily come out at 1200 buck i am not yet convinced because especially the sensor integration with cycling with my garmin is so seamless but if i can find a good solution to keep track of that looking at you apple for proper triathlon use i may be one of those people who would buy one of these i may do so regardless if one of my other option dy on me,['battery']
879,i want to get it but a real diving watch or a real heavy duty watch are built much more tailored to their intention i love the higher battery life though yet for field use i would probably still have a case over it,['battery']
880,i spend day at a time in the mountain and the apple watch ha always been so disappointing in it is potential for mapping navigation safety comms etc hamstrung by dismal battery life and apple functionality gatekeeping this definitely ha my attention but i am still unconvinced i will probably keep using my phone for the bulk of those need paired to my garmin spot inreach for satellite messaging,['battery']
881,drawing on marque analogy apple is expanding from the inside out that is they take their standard watch and basically double it is capability but at the end the ultra is still very much tied to it original apple watch gene in contrast company like garmin coros suunto go from the outside in they concentrate first on giving athlete the most useful feature long battery gps heart rate o2 sat training zone sleep tracking etc and truly excel at those metric then they toss in a few of the most useful connectivity feature like call text notification so the main question becomes what role you want your smartwatch to play in your life or training if you want your watch to be an active extension clone of your phone then the apple watch and the new ultra make sense if you want the best athletic computer to guide your workout while not missing important text or phone call then garmin coros suunto have you covered,['battery']
882,nobody mkbhd at 69percent battery noice,['battery']
883,i am an old guy who like to ride bike and i am a tech geek last summer i rode from istanbul to barcelona my stainless series 3 could not be used on the ride because the battery did not last using strava but i hate wearing a chest hrm i just wish the ultra would broadcast heart rate to my iphone or my wahoo computer i do have one of these on order it is time pun intended,['battery']
884,excited for my delivery on friday this will be my first apple watch been wearing g shock mudmasters and garmins exclusively for the last 8 year during my time in the military and off duty i work in real estate now so i am looking forward to finally being able to answer call on my wrist while also being able to comfortably bring it out to the wood on my bow hunt and to the mountain on my ski trip without worry that it will shatter or lose battery during the day i really think this will be perfect for my lifestyle,['battery']
885,went to sleep with 69 percent battery nice,['battery']
886,i mean if you guy want longer battery hour then just get amazfit fitbit they have a version where you do not need to charge for more than 40 day other than that i think apple did a good one on this,['battery']
887,honestly having a garmin fenix i would pas on this for a lot of reason it just is not the right kind of watch for outdoor adventure especially with only a 2 day battery life v garmin is 9 it doe not do anything extra that the fenix doe not,['battery']
888,i honestly can not be bothered with a watch that only last a couple of day on a single charge if i wa an athlete or a diver or something i would have considered it but i do not need these feature they are more of a luxury for me i am not willing to sacrifice battery life for them there are dumber chinese smart watch that can last week or a month with much smaller battery i would rather go with that plus they are literally a fraction of the price like around 1 16th of the price lol,['battery']
889,nah i will stay with my garmin 955 still beat the ultra on battery still beat the ultra on connecting to cycling and running device with ant still beat it for all the athletic metric i do,['battery']
890,this watch is huge and still ha such a weak battery garmin last for week without physical activity and much smaller that hideous thing,['battery']
891,i have a garmin smartwatch easily get 3 week of use out of one charge i am considering getting the apple watch but i do not want need the ultra why can not they make a standard apple watch with a larger battery because neither the standard nor the ultras battery life is impressive the ultras battery life should be the bare minimum for smart watch nowadays,['battery']
892,i think the seller for me is the longevity i am still rocking a series 3 and the batter life ha diminished but it is certainly not unusable now this with it battery life and ruggedness i feel like it will last me a lifetime that is it for me longevity,['battery']
893,69percent battery,['battery']
894,woke up with 69percent battery nice,['battery']
895,now try to wear a garmin fenix 7x solar or epic 2 to really blow your lind on battery life,['battery']
896,garmin doe it for cheaper and a more functional screen and better battery it a nah,['battery']
897,a a garmin fenix owner i passed on the apple watch would have been back around the series 2 originally due to the unimpressive water proof tech and gps battery life if my garmin ever need replaced the apple watch ultra will finally be a contender rather than just buying the latest garmin fenix,['battery']
898,definitely a great evolution for the apple watch but i wonder if the upgraded feature are truly enough for the hardcore adventurer for example 100m water resistance will take you deeper but is that a static 100m most true dive watch are rated for 200 300m because when you are moving the watch around under water you put a lot more pressure on the seal and entry point than just having it sit there 99 99percent of diver will not go to 200m but that is not what the rating actually mean also for those who are doing multi day hike in the backcounty the extra battery life is great but when you are constantly running gps to track your mileage and route compass etc that battery life i am sure is much lower than the rating so it is great for maybe 1 2 full day of hiking but what about multi day excursion i doubt it would last for a 2 3 day backpacking trip with all the function running it is definitely a good step for the casual outdoors person but for my more hardcore outing i will stick with my garmin fenix and i do use an apple watch for everyday work around home purpose it is a much better smartwatch but it is not purpose built the way garmin etc are,['battery']
899,the whole time you had theater mode on i would not call this a real world battery test with that in mind,['battery']
900,that will happen soon apparently the apple watch ultra last 36 hour with normal use and 60 hour on low power mode which is 2 5 day with the new feature that apple is adding to the apple watch which supposedly increase battery life by 3x it will last for around 7 5 day on low power mode and 4 5 with normal use,['battery']
901,that battery life for an apple watch is crazy hope next year the regular ha similar improvments,['battery']
902,69percent battery nice nice indeed,['battery']
903,the battery itself is the only reason why i want this watch,['battery']
904,i do not understand why they keep marketing for athlete the simple fact that it is rugged ha caught my eye i have a landscaping business and work with different material every day including water if they were to market it towards people who do hard labor work they would reach a new market say saying and i am really debating getting this one because i have a a 5 series and it hold up really well however the battery for me is where it get me,['battery']
905,my apple watch series 2 recently died and seeing the ultra actually pushed me to get a garmin watch instead for the money the battery life is what ultimately swayed me away from the apple watch,['battery']
906,great feature but i could not imagine taking this out for a proper treck or adventure a advertised battery life is still measured in hour not day if it can last mon friday min then it will have the attention for me i do not need another thing to add for my battery anxiety,['battery']
907,if you are looking forward to get this watch for outdoor i guess that outdoor trip should be from morning to evening and get back home end of the day with a dead watch on the wrist atleast 1 week battery backup would have been appreciated with this price tag,['battery']
908,you seemed so obsessed with battery life most people will charge it either at night or if used for sleep tracking maybe an hour or so before sleep,['battery']
909,i do not mind big watch but that thing look bloody uncomfortable i wish they made like an ultra s smaller battery sure but a size that would be managable then again i did not even like the normal apple watch that much when i had it it just dig into your wrist when you bend your hand once i bent down to tie my shoe and accidentally called the police on the watch they really need to make these thing more ergonomic i am thinking of getting the small and thin samsung watch i switched to pixel so apple watch is a no go either way,['battery']
910,3 day for a watch battery everyone this is so silly,['battery']
911,i ordered one just for the battery,['battery']
912,battery life suck for 800,['battery']
913,a the owner of a smart watch the answer is no smart watch are about the most worthless and least worn watch you can buy get yourself a good solar atomic casio abc watch that you will never have to change the battery on never ever have to charge and that is always right you just put it on the nightstand and forget it and put it on your wrist when you need it no charging no dead battery no firmware upgrade no app installs no unable to read the screen in bright light no wifi or bluetooth connection problem none of that garbage just a good solid always working always right watch if you want to do anything else pull out your smart phone and enjoy a big screen and longer run time smart watch are huge fail smart watch are fun to take on a camping trip and play with in the tent at night when you have lot of time and nothing else to do and just want to be distracted by any technlogy and that is about it like an obsolete psp everywhere else they are almost entirely useless,['battery']
914,a a mechanic this watch is perfect my series 5 ha taken an absolute thrashing over the year even needed apple care replacement a few time this ultra is perfect rugged a hell and long lasting battery for sleep tracking and longer day it is perfect,['battery']
915,that 2 day battery life always felt like a dream but it is real now,['battery']
916,the apple watch ultra just isnt good enough for me i do not care about calorie count or how much i worked out or how many step i have done i just want a watch that make phone call and text and most importantly last longer than a week this just doesnt cut it for me i do not have the time to take my watch off and on every morning and night i just simply can not on top of that the battery doe wear down after a solid 4 month hell whats that battery on that watch after a year look at the apple watch 7 whats the battery percentage now,['battery']
917,give u an iphone ultra like this extra long battery i do not care if it is thicker make it twice a thick and triple or quadruple the battery life,"['battery', 'battery']"
918,a watch with just two day battery life is still insane to me,['battery']
919,the withing is watch ha some of the same feature but ha a 2 week battery life might be worth a look,['battery']
920,i wa planning on buying a series 7 once the series 8 launched but i ended up ordering the ultra because i really wanted the scratch resistance which really closed the price gap throw in the massive battery gap and i am surprised anyone would buy a top end series 8 instead of the ultra,['battery']
921,i would imagine you could stretch that battery out even more by putting it in low power mode throughout the day then turning it off when you go into your workout like a few other people that have commented i am upgrading to this from a series 7 primarily for the ruggedness and the extended battery life i am one of those people that wear my watch at night my alarm is my watch vibrating to wake me up so having a much uptime between charge is my ideal my logic is the le i have to charge the watch the longer i can stretch the actual life of the battery out read degradation and the ultra seems to be heading in the direction i need the apple watch to go not gon na lie i miss the week long battery life i would get out of my old pebble watch but obviously watch like the apple watch do significan notly more looking forward to getting my ultra,['battery']
922,i am not in any of the three outlier category you mention but this is the apple watch i have been waiting for i have had the stainless steel series 5 for 3 year it is been through a lot of daily bump without a scratch i took a fall in a parking lot and it put a small gouge in the case by the edge of the crystal but did not scratch the crystal at all the a few month ago it fell face down on a stone tile floor and broke the crystal the ultra would have survived that fall i want the durability and the battery life also it is only dollar50 more than my series 5 wa so the price is actually reasonable,['battery']
923,69percent battery is all am here for,['battery']
924,battery life alone is enough for me to buy one of those not needing to worry about charging for a full day is amazing,['battery']
925,always a fan of your work but i feel like you are missing the point though mainstream people will buy the apple watch ultra to have the best apple watch in term of feature and for battery life also a bigger and bolder size is a fashion statement and always ha been,['battery']
926,maybe an stupid question wa the gps enabled when you worked out i own a garmin fenix 6 and the battery last week and with a heavy use of gps either biking and running,['battery']
927,i have ordered an apple watch ultra it is my first apple watch i am not doing extreme sport like that but here are the reason i got it 1 i am an io developer and i want to have all the feature available on the physical device i own so i can properly test everything 2 battery life 3 i am quite tall and my wife think a big watch would look better on me thanks for another great review marque,['battery']
928,with about 69percent battery me at the same time nice,['battery']
929,can not really justifydollar800 on this when my dollar35 xiaomi doe more than half the feature of iwatch with 15 day of battery life but i guess if you have money to spare whatever,['battery']
930,i know this watch ha an audience but it sell a the only apple watch with a decent battery still not good too so i think lot of apple watch user will switch to this thing because of that,['battery']
931,a a member of the endurance audience i do not think this watch is it it is not just the inferior battery life it is the metric and sensor that company like garmin polar and suunto have created great training feature around i need a watch that will last day and day without a charge not just day but it is cool how long this last for an apple watch,['battery']
932,i wa in the hospital recently without my charger for my galaxy watch 5 pro and it lasted the 4 day i wa in the hospital my watch 4 hardly made it through a day i wa pretty impressed it seems this is the year of good battery life in smart watch which is awesome,['battery']
933,this is exactly what i have wanted in an apple watch for year now rugged larger and brighter screen awesome battery life i am so hyped to get my order on friday,['battery']
934,i would just buy this watch for it battery and look,['battery']
935,to me nah not a safe dive watch a for the battery i usually charge it every night so i do not really need an extra long battery a for the watch face not impressed sorry,['battery']
936,damn man that one third of my huawei watch battery life,['battery']
937,i am no adventurous person i am a city life goer but battery life is of the utmost important to me and a reason why i never used an apple watch i did not want something else to have to charge every night,['battery']
938,ended that day with 69percent battery that is nice,['battery']
939,there is one more grup of people who just want a bigger battery,['battery']
940,reason not to use it battery and io,['battery']
941,you can make out like this is only for extreme athlete but a a fat guy this totally appeal to me for the larger screen and better battery life,['battery']
942,now if they could make an iphone ultra that is slightly thicker with 3 day battery,['battery']
943,like how the apple watch is slowly developing into the all in one watch with better battery life i will be keeping a close eye on future development,['battery']
944,a a person running marathon and doing triathlons i would not buy this garmin and wahoo just do the stuff i need better including battery and integration,['battery']
945,drop the ruggedness and most of the extra feature and just give me more battery life,['battery']
946,this watch cost the same a the stainless steel apple watch have cost for so much more battery and feature i am not sure why people keep throwing out that 800 00 price like it is unprecedented,['battery']
947,2 day battery for 800 buck,['battery']
948,garmin is a lot better for fitness and battery dude,['battery']
949,i get 3 day easy with my apple watch 7 so not sure why you get so bad battery life i get better battery life with the apple watch 7 than my galaxy watch 4,['battery']
950,but is 60hrs roughly battery time good enough for endurance athlete hard core hiker etc,"['battery', 'battery']"
951,i stopped using my apple watch because the battery only lasted until lunch time,['battery']
952,can you buy it for dollar99 just a ll cool j said no i do not think so where samsung pro 5 you have many option buy it for dollar240 or get it from t mobile for dollar99 with exchange of samsung watch which ha similar feature with this who ha dollar800 money to spend so if you add hard watch band then it is going to cost dollar900 plus watch protector cover then it is going to cost dollar1000 are you buying tag huere watch you can buy tag huere at costco and walmart for le than dollar1000 but samsung pro 5 cost are same a regular battery sport active watch i wish both company sends there smart watch to soilder in ukraine for ultimate watch indurance challenge test and see which watch serf and we will find out which watch is best and which watch soilder pick if watch serf in war then defiantly in regular use at home will be nothing,['battery']
953,what sort of battery life will you get purely on cellular i have the original watch se and routinely leave my phone at home to manage screen on time etc i get through my day with some battery with minimal usage however with moderate usage i probably only get 8 hour before it run out would be interesting to know how it compare to the watch ultra,['battery']
954,the longest battery life apple watch ive had wa the original nike watch it lasted 3 full day and 2 full night i wa beyond shocked when i upgraded to the 5th edition apple watch i just got the 8 and it lasting much longer than my 5th edition,['battery']
955,i wa thinking about upgrading to this from the se and after watching this i might actually do it i bought my se last christmas and loved it but am being held back by it battery and the screen durability my screen currently ha deep scratch and i love using it for sleep tracking but i also work early morning so being able to grab it and go would be amazing plus i just purchased an euc so being able to go on long trail ride with those saftey feature really speaks volume to me,['battery']
956,just get a garmin or something way more in depth review of sleep and relation to fitness readiness battery that actually is good amoled screen option a long a you do not want to text which i never found myself doing come on over to the garmin side haha,['battery']
957,huawei gt 3 pro 350euros same feature 2 week of battery life,['battery']
958,hey that is my pro trek that watch is a tank had it for year same battery and the atomic time keeping is great,['battery']
959,impressed with battery life my question is doe it overheat in hot weather 105degrees condition i am in arizona and my samsung watch 3 overheats after 45 minute when i go on my 3 hour run,['battery']
960,i am impressed how the apple watch user praised the new long life battery of this watch meanwhile my 3y old galaxy watch still can do the same a this watch when it come to battery life hr monitor is always active,['battery']
961,but why ha pro or extreme more battery that is what everyone is going for doe not have to be a pro or extreme,['battery']
962,i find that battery quite important only reason i have been using garmin is the battery life actually,['battery']
963,that wa one thing i found weird about my garmin is everyone said the battery life lasted a whole week and it doe until you use the gps then it only last like 3 5 hour,['battery']
964,0 18 69percent battery nice,['battery']
965,i wish apple offered a bigger battery in the 45mm form factor i do not need all the extreme feature but could really use more battery life,['battery']
966,i think the only thing that wa not talked about wa people that like leaving their phone at home so we are streaming music taking phone call and tracking our workout that can crush the battery on a normal apple watch,['battery']
967,did he did he just said he went to sleep with 69percent battery then he said nice 0 14 he is a connaisseur,['battery']
968,basic apple watch is pure shit when u go on longer bicycle ride because battery die so fast,['battery']
969,well you got a remember man that watch i have more battery than a cell phone,['battery']
970,yeah it ha good battery life but for how long,['battery']
971,you can do the same thing battery wise with a galaxy watch 5 pro for way le money,['battery']
972,being that i am not trying to be in the apple ecosystem i am looking forward to a pixel watch ultra for great battery life and bonus,['battery']
973,personally i think a garmin watch would be better for battery life and overall ruggedness although i have i have not used both the watch so take this with a grain of salt,['battery']
974,been a garmin user for year training and running marathon averaging 8 hour of gps running per week yearly the battery life would feel like such a compromise my garmin 945 need charger once every 10 11 day,['battery']
975,my casio give me 2 year of battery life,['battery']
976,is it too weird that i want this one just for the battery life,['battery']
977,i will never understand this watch it ha everything and more i can not think of anyone who would actually need all the feature the watch offer while it is only running on 2 day battery life there are so many better watch way more customized for what you actually need to use it for while having a battery life of a week or more not to mention the ridiculous price you are paying for it while many other brand offer better and cheaper,['battery']
978,you forgot people like me or the category that i belong to i have been in the ecosystem from the day of the iphone 4 i own an iphone a macbook pro an ipad airpods and i used to have an imac but apple can not sell me the watch yet why i do not want to charge it or worry about charging it every 2 day my 10 year old casio still work just fine and i changed the battery like 3 time during those 10 year the battery cost dollar2 5 and guess what i did it myself,['battery']
979,only gon na get it if they make a newer model i have the series 4 and my only complaint is that battery life doe not last very long especially when the day involves any sporting activity or the like and i want to see people is reaction to it after a few month a year passed,['battery']
980,i have the series 6 a full battery can barley get me 12 hour sometimes le,['battery']
981,idk why a diver would buy a watch that can not be repair or in 3 year you will have to throw it away and buy a new one because the battery life inevitably tank ik diver that own watch for decade even pas them down to their kid these watch are basically planned obsolescence,['battery']
982,so how doe it perform for extreme sport like expedition diving and marathon w gps on just the capability n ruggedness alone doe not make it an extreme sport watch doe it last more than a day w gps on for expedition if not how can this cater for extreme sport if the battery life can last for few day for normal activity for god sake make the watch more appealing,['battery']
983,1 that intro wa sick 2 i notice that you are on theater mode is that something you have on all the time would that lengthen the battery life while reducing the functionality something most people would not want to do with this watch,['battery']
984,i think theater mode just shuts off always on and silence notification so it save a little bit of battery from the always on when you are playing ultimate frisbee and will not be looking at your watch but still want to track your performance,['battery']
985,regular high end watch battery life v smart watch is not even comparable idk why you did that obviously smart watch component need more power than a regular watch because they can do way more thing,['battery']
986,with this battery life,['battery']
987,how is battery life so bad compared to other smart watch it the only thing keeping me from getting an apple watch competitor have more than twice the battery life,['battery']
988,69percent battery nice i could not agree more when he said that lol,['battery']
989,watch sud b round ima iphone user using huawei gt 2 pro it last more than 10 day good battery and look good,['battery']
990,when i wa watching intro with animation i heard low battery sound of airpods and legit thought that my airpods are low on power took me a second to realize that sound wa actually in the video u got me there mkbhd nice job,['battery']
991,my garmin fenix get 9 day of battery just saying apple watch ultra the pick me girl of adventure watch,['battery']
992,any emts use apple watch how useful is it when you need to see second what is your setup how is the battery,['battery']
993,battery life sound like my ticwatch pro 3,['battery']
994,my biggest complaint is that apple changed some of the watch face to look better on the ultra but i hate how it look on my series 7 same with the new iphone home screen but none of that ha anything to do with your review for me i work in road construction painting line on the road dealing with traffic paint solvent and the reflective glass bead among other thing wa a horrible environment for my aluminum series 3 i got the series 7 for myself last christmas in stainless steel and i have been loving it the stainless is much easier to clean then aluminum and scratch a lot le the larger screen is amazing too for me it is perfect it wa a dollar1 263 cad watch but it wa exactly what i needed with some extra goody the ultra would be just shy of a dollar1 400 watch with a lot of feature i frankly do not need it look slick but just is not for me but for those who were looking for that longer battery life and more rugged construction this is the watch for them great video a usual,['battery']
995,it is still really annoying though that you have not tried a garmin or coros watch they do what most people need with still better sport feature while the battery can last week it is just insane the comparison ha not been made,['battery']
996,i love doing outdoorsy stuff so this sounded like the perfect watch for me i ended up getting the series 7 since ultra wa too expensive and you can not really dress it up silver and orange doe not work with a suit period but also because they are updating s7 with the same compass stuff plus i can not use lte with my carrier so i might a well just get the gps version of 7 for cheap though i love the bigger battery life and that wa my largest hang up for apple watch in the past at the end of the day i do not know any other apple watch user who have complained about it i suppose i will just charge my watch overnight like other people do haha,['battery']
997,the only reason i do not use apple watch is 1 2 day battery life this is ridiculous,['battery']
998,i will wait for the dollar25 chinese clone currently wearing a plasticky q25 that track my physical activity measure my o2 saturation my temperature and ha a battery that last a week,['battery']
999,went to sleep with about 69percent percent battery nice man of culture fr,['battery']
1000,those who need a specialized gear should get a specialized dedicated gear not do it all device such a for diver a for hiker you will be lost once battery is dead you really want a dedicated handheld gps device,['battery']
1001,lol that battery life is still a joke,['battery']
1002,two year ago i bought a coros over an apple watch because i need battery life for 12 hour plus run if an apple watch could do 13 15 hour of activity run time i would totally be interested my worry though is that it would only do that for one year then the next year it might only do 10 hour then on year three only 8 hour etc,['battery']
1003,a someone who like a bigger face watch all my automatic are jealous for the amount of wear my apple watch get i upgraded exclusively for the new battery life and the larger ruggedized look i did not realize this existed until after launch and now i have to wait until november to get it lol,['battery']
1004,0 00 duration of watch 1 15 it is ultra not pro 2 48 b roll unboxing 3 08 ruggedness feature battery 3 54 build quality 5 51 battery amp capability 6 33 the orange action button 8 06 who is this watch for 8 22 for diver 9 10 for hiker 10 13 for endurance athlete 10 54 battery optimization 11 46 watch band 12 22 review from different people 12 47 marque review,['battery']
1005,dollar1300 australian for half the feature and half the battery of even last year galaxy watch 4 classic that cost dollar600 also for that price you could get a garmin fenix 7 saphire lmao never seen such a ridiculous and useless overpriced turd in my life so glad i dumped apple i also knew the series 8 would be literally identical to the series 7 with 3 week battery lol somehow apple ha conditioned it is base into accepting the same junk year after year and believing it is new it is a cult,['battery']
1006,i am an android guy a well and i honestly did not think i would be into having a smartwatch either but i recently hit 41 and my dr said i need to keep track of my heart rate being on new med so i went online looked for review and picked up a cheap letsfit iw2 and it is been great a a basic smartwatch with 10 day battery life i think apple watch are overkill for most people,['battery']
1007,it is certainly an impressive watch but i think most people will get it purely for the battery and increased screen brightness hopefully this trickle down to the regular watch in the future,['battery']
1008,i will wait till the next generation of the watch i need more battery life,['battery']
1009,i really do not understand how people put up with watch that have to recharged multiple time a week the pebble and amazfit have 30 day battery life all with running heart rate and sleep monitoring all at dollar50 they want to me to pay 16x more for worse battery life a screen i will almost never look at and having to shout into my wrist hard pas,['battery']
1010,while one wear a automatic watch whether a lux swiss or others youll never have to worry abt batt life ir charging and contarily smart watch big caveat is the battery life so why not make a automatic self charging smart watch,['battery']
1011,i wear my aw on my right wrist for it usefulness a activity tracker and various item while traveling i have my explorer on my left wrist a my watch left in my home timezone it ha worked well for a couple of year i think what the ultra get right is the double battery life this allows it to be what it aesthetic implies a wrist computer i will now be able to leave my iphone at home a i will be able to use aw ultra a an iphone replacement which is what i think it really is my explorer may also stay home with my iphone,['battery']
1012,3 day is battery is mediocre against garmin watch,['battery']
1013,that is a very good point i bought a 7 last year but the battery circus is annoying a week is worth should be the bare minimum,['battery']
1014,i have not had an apple watch since the series 1 and that had a bad battery i ordered this one because i like having the top end model the battery and size also sold me,['battery']
1015,this right here this is exactly what i am talking about 99percent of people buying this are buying it for the battery and because it is something new from apple,['battery']
1016,69percent battery nice 0 17,['battery']
1017,i should wait for 2nd version apple watch ultra maybe extra more battery and the black apple watch,['battery']
1018,if you want to compare the apple watch ultra with these other watch do not just point the battery life i am pretty sure that a watch that last more than the awp are not even close to it feature,['battery']
1019,2 day of battery is not enough for anything in the forest,['battery']
1020,i like how long the battery last,['battery']
1021,i did not realize the apple watch had such poor battery my watch 3 classic get 2 full day pretty easily,['battery']
1022,the dive computer and hiking feature arent a good a the dedicated stuff and wont replace them it only scratch the surface so this is just a more durable longer battery way overpriced apple watch and people will buy it anyway coz apple,['battery']
1023,damn just for the battery this seems worth an upgrade,['battery']
1024,the problem with the ultra is that in europe it priced at 999dollar and that is definitely not worth the price for a few minimal upgrade nothing too significan not regarding battery life also,['battery']
1025,huawei make battery stay up to 14 day even in pro model what is the wow factor here in battery,['battery']
1026,great video i know a bunch of people are going to drop dollar800 just for the battery alone,['battery']
1027,what about battery life under lte i constantly go on run without my phone and only have my garmin tactic delta track me and play music but would like to stream and track,['battery']
1028,if only apple would put this battery life in the regular series 8 while keeping the same size one can hope,['battery']
1029,i can guarantee the battery life of this watch would not last long enough for me to complete an ironman,['battery']
1030,you are missing a group first responder they are going to love an apple watch with longer battery life and better durability,['battery']
1031,look at the battery life of actual sport focused smartwatches answer is simple it not even close to being worth it,['battery']
1032,garmin battery life is 20 day what a joke,['battery']
1033,i do not see it being worth the money the apple watch is bulky the worst thing is a watch that slide on your wrist i can see someone banging it up against the wall pretty easily is the battery removable can it be changed like a g shock tech v functionality,['battery']
1034,2 day battery life is not enough in 2022,['battery']
1035,what a headache i have been with garmin watch bike computer and bike indoor trainer for the past 7 year and i am super happy with all their product performance yet recently i have switched to apple one i do not need spotify and so when running i can not use it on garmin not to mention listening to an audiobook now i wa thinking to upgrade to garmin fr955 mainly due to hrv running power battery the size i have pretty slim wrist and obviously the data that i have accumulated on garmin connect i know i could transfer it to ie strava but i do not want another company to have my data will wait few more week to see other review from triathletes and than decide thanks for the review a usual very useful,['battery']
1036,i bought a series 6 last year i always get two full day and night with it i did not know that wa abnormal wonder why i get so much battery life,['battery']
1037,going to sleep with about 69percent battery nice,['battery']
1038,a a normal person who definitely will not push this watch to it limit the battery life is so tempting but i know i can not justify the price because i will not use a majority of the feature this watch boast i have not ordered one yet and maybe i will maybe i will not but it is so tempting for the wrong reason,['battery']
1039,wait until he test the garmin fenix 7 the battery life will blow his mind,['battery']
1040,that wa my exact thought lol i currently use a fenix 6x but if it get to the point one of these can last through an entire backpacking trip i could absolutely see switching there is some interesting battery tech coming down the line so maybe soon,['battery']
1041,i do see the ultra a the longest battery life apple watch,['battery']
1042,my casio cost dollar15 is very slim ha a great retro aethestic that i enjoy and a 10 year battery life date alarm stopwatch timer that is all i need,['battery']
1043,when apple come out with it in black and even a little more battery life i will consider it,['battery']
1044,eventually these watch will last a full week on one charge apple and others will hopefully soon use flexible lithium ion solid state battery in the form of a battery wristband,['battery']
1045,for double the battery life too and it not like stainless steel is a expensive metal i think titanium cost more than s,['battery']
1046,of course apple watch battery is trash,['battery']
1047,even in the smartwatch world 2 day battery is not impressive,['battery']
1048,i can not imagine taking 2 day battery watch to the mountain trip sorry it suck,['battery']
1049,disappointing battery life,['battery']
1050,nice review it not fair to compare it to the similarly priced high end garmin watch maybe the dollar300 dollar400 one and then it twice the price of them garmin fenix 6x 7x we are talking 1 3 week of battery life with more gps and heart rate tracking so it still a fashion lifesytle watch and not going to be sufficient for ironman ultra endurance atheletes also i am waiting to see the tear down on how good the apple sapphire glass is i have heard rumor it significan notly softer than the garmin sapphire glass which is a game changer for a rugged watch i would love to see you do a comparision between this and a garmin fenix 7x sapphire your thought and opinion would be great to hear,['battery']
1051,there is more to a smartwatch than battery life some people like me use their smartwatch a a phone replacement and can not do that with a garmin watch,['battery']
1052,hey marque wa cellular active during your time using the apple watch the battery life is impressive a is even just for activity tracking but that would be even more insane if cellular wa active a well i am often away from my phone while doing activity so that is the most important thing for me,['battery']
1053,69percent battery life nice,['battery']
1054,wait i already have the battery saver on my series 7 but the ultra doe not have it yet,['battery']
1055,battery noice,['battery']
1056,and here i am with my gear s 3 frontier from 2018 with 3 4days avg battery aside the feature set it offer do seem quite nice and useful,['battery']
1057,even someone who prefers round watch i like the design of this one and it ha a bunch of great feature but my similar sized garmin watch ha up to 50 day and still over a month with regular use battery life i understand that this ha way more stuff that drain the battery but a week is a must in my opinion plus i am not sure how well it would work with android but that is not the point here one thing i am hoping this watch start is the bigger casing variant most watch stop at 46mm proper sport watch can go up to 51mm i could see a new ultra line from everyone with that size,['battery']
1058,a a person that work in construction and also wear an apple watch every day while working i decided to upgrade from my series 5 to this will i ever use the marathon the hiking or the diving feature probably not but the ruggedness the battery life the bright screen and how big it is all speak to my need keep up the good review mkbhd,['battery']
1059,i did not charge my smart watch for 16 day and it still had 40percent battery when i decided to charge it it only took like 10 min to charge fully a well with a 12 watt charging brick only downside is that it doe not have touch screen super pleased though with the garmin smart watch,['battery']
1060,i wonder if garmin had a good cheaper alternative with longer battery life i just need something to track work out or something,['battery']
1061,look up perpetual calendar automatic watch and be blown away of the battery life,['battery']
1062,it is crap huawei watch battery go on for 7 day,['battery']
1063,after switching to garmin i do not think i will ever switch back to apple watch 30 day of battery life solar charging extremely durable multi satellite gps ton of different workout i highly recommend the garmin fenix 7,['battery']
1064,aris routis it is phenomenal for an apple watch sure garmin is slaughtering apple in the battery life department but they are different kind of smartwatches with different usecases i like to use my apple watch a a replacement for my phone and can not do that with a garmin,['battery']
1065,apple try to play with the big boy at fitness ie garmin with this comparison is something that ha to happen and seriously now garmin is slaughtering apple battery life when my garmin fenix 6 is at one full week with most setting on and if we go to model with solar panel it is not even a fair comparison trying to say that 3 day of battery life is phenomenal just make me laugh,['battery']
1066,only a minute in but your battery life surely wa extended by your use of theater mode and funny enough i am sure how many notification your watch buzz for drastically change battery life no friend great battery lol,['battery']
1067,i have a pretty chronic case of range anxiety bigger battery always better i do not dive not really climbing everest today imagine that activity reminder you still have an hour to close your everest ring i am sold on battery alone,['battery']
1068,an ultra watch need to have atleast 2 week of battery it also need to support cycling sensor metric apart from swimming and running so this is not an ultra watch at all,['battery']
1069,you have missed out people who work in construction like me a more rugged apple watch with a bigger battery is hugely useful to me which is why i ordered one,['battery']
1070,now mkbhd ha given some point for apple to take note make it like a casio watch infinite battery and tapered edge anyway this watch is too much for me,['battery']
1071,i do not know anything about smart watch and their usual battery life but what you said in the intro about this one is battery life sounded pretty damn impressive,['battery']
1072,i have the series 5 and have no issue with it except for battery life despite the price i will be getting the ultra exclusively for the battery the waypoint feature will be fun for geocaching but realistically i do that twice a year maybe battery life is critical for me though,['battery']
1073,i have the series 5 and got it when it came out and the battery doe not last a long i am glad i pay the dollar 4 00 a month for applecare plus so when i have time i will take it to the apple store due to battery but still a good watch,['battery']
1074,same battery life wa a huge yes for me,['battery']
1075,i got the apple watch series 4 and i am unhappy with the battery life on it but other than that it doe a an apple watch should it is not the best one in the lot but i am not interested in paying more then 100 dollar for a watch that is just me,['battery']
1076,why are you comparing battery life from a black and white casio watch to basically an iphone on your wrist,['battery']
1077,2 day battery on a watch and it get a pretty good from mkbhd damn what will my smart watch with 50 day batter backup get only if it had a apple logo somewhere on it p a watch with le than 10 day battery backup is useless for me any trip or outside activity i plan i have to consider charging a silly watch that is too much pain in the a for me,['battery']
1078,exactly you are getting all the feature with more than double the battery life a well a some of the smart watch feature,['battery']
1079,would be sick to see him do a comparison between this and the fenix 7x he will then see what good battery life is,['battery']
1080,by turning of the most notification i get almost the same batterylife with my old watch 6 sad about this one only produced in silver,['battery']
1081,ok that low battery sound at 1 11 really got me i wa like damn did not i just charge my earphone last night,['battery']
1082,i want to like it and it work for most people but it is not the watch for people who do endurance sport that last 24 hour or do not want to have to charge their watch every couple day my coros vertix 2 watch ha not been charged since september 2 i have logged 27 hour of gps running during that time and it still ha 54percent battery life left the coros is also about dollar100 cheaper,['battery']
1083,apple need to design a wireless battery adapter that connects to the watch while on your wrist during sleep to charge it then in the morning you dock the battery pack and let it charge back to full and then go about your day,['battery']
1084,i like this despite the fact it is pretty useless to a lazy boy like myself battery life still suck compared to say the entire amazfit series that go past 2 or more week on a charge while still being very useful to the vast majority of folk i hope apple get that in future version great review marque,['battery']
1085,those are not very good smartwatches though partial smartwatches maybe no full fledged smartwatch so far ha more than two and now three day of actual battery life,['battery']
1086,69percent battery nice marque,['battery']
1087,if it were not so ugly and expensive i would be interested simply because of the battery life give me a non pro version with that battery apple,['battery']
1088,yeah a 3 hour workout ai not gon na burn 2000 calorie that is like 80percent of a marathon buy garmin with a battery that can last over a month,['battery']
1089,too bad i have stopped doing triathlons and recently got the series 8 and i got my garmin 945 with awesome battery life this is massive watch for my small wrist actually the normal series 8 is more wearable too,['battery']
1090,i feel there is a limit to how smart a watch need to be i used to have an android based smart watch and the battery life wa poor now i have a garmin venu sq it doe all the fitness health tracking i need ha phone notification and medium control yet the battery last all week it is just the right amount of smart,['battery']
1091,feel like the watch 5 pro is a better choice 90percent of the feature much better battery life and like half the price,['battery']
1092,the bigger battery is nice but that thing look like too much of a chonker for my wrist,['battery']
1093,can we just get a regular one with better battery life,['battery']
1094,having worn sapphire crystal all my life the isapphire scratching at mohs scale 6 is a deal breaker for me i need a rugged watch for mountain biking like my fenix 6 i get two full week battery including weekend ride dual gps already and zero scratch on the screen after eighteen month,['battery']
1095,i have the black stainless steel series 4 and there is not a single mark anywhere on it after four year my mom ha a regular aluminum series 5 and it is covered in surface wear micro scratch all over the screen i can not speak for how well it would hold up in heavy outdoors activity i am very much an inside person but for normal use the sapphire crystal is far more durable than the glass in the regular watch i have been looking at getting a new one maybe this year or next year but probably next year i still get two day out of my battery with my light use,['battery']
1096,i know is not possible due to battery size but i wish there wa a smaller one,['battery']
1097,69percent battery nice hahaha,['battery']
1098,i guess you have an inevitable relationship with 69percent battery in your life,['battery']
1099,1 11 my ptsd kicked in when i heard that low battery sound just suck to hear it on your airpods,['battery']
1100,richard blahou ek a a hunter hiker i bought a garmin fenix 6 sapphire to replace my apple watch i got so tired of having to charge it my hunting buddy ha a garmin and i got jealous of his battery life and never needing to charge i can go 15 day without charging and that includes sleep monitoring my mind is blown,['battery']
1101,that is really good battery life damn,['battery']
1102,damn that battery backup,['battery']

1104,keaton anderson i would fully take a few le of the smart feature for that longer battery life garmin style they last 4 5 day,['battery']
1105,keaton anderson fr 5 7 day battery life is insane something that doesnt exist in any piece of tech anywhere,['battery']
1106,dude be wanting a rubix cube size watch on his wrist for a week long battery life we getting closer but tech doe not seem to be there yet,['battery']
1107,best thing about having a watch too is when your phone battery dy or you forget to charge it you can use your watch,['battery']
1108,mine came with a dead battery and no screen film it wa some weird little cardboard sleeve it look new but i have a feeling it is a used watch,['battery']
1109,i am always disappointed with battery life of apple watch,['battery']
1110,ryam they have but it is basic physic that limit it i think the battery ha more than enough on the series 8 and ultra it is a computer phone and walk in talkie on your wrist using it take power,['battery']
1111,ahh but i mean why apple can not improve battery life,['battery']
1112,the only thing i expect is a far better battery life for both the 9 or x and the ultra,['battery']
1113,all i want is just a decent battery,['battery']
1114,give me battery and a better fitness app,['battery']
1115,i hope they can improve battery life or solar powered version,['battery']
1116,honestly i do not like how long the apple watch battery last pretty bad compared to competitor,['battery']
1117,my wish list 1 cgm 2 body composition 3 bp 4 tue all day battery life of 24hrs without low power mode chance are apple will switch all production line to 3nm this barring any technical or yield issue,['battery']
1118,improved battery life will probably be the reason why i am waiting for the series 9,['battery']
1119,oh f these battery duration le than one day is just ridiculous,['battery']
1120,if apple watch next year come with battery and solar they can compete better with garmin they would sell fast like hotcake,['battery']
1121,how can i find a apple watch 8 that ha a dead battery,['battery']
1122,i have a 40mm series 4 and a very small wrist the 44 mm wa too big in my wrist so i have not upgraded to the ultra i just want a longer battery life,['battery']
1123,i would like to be able to see my note on my watch and have different ringtone option or like when someone call you both your phone and watch go off have that for all notification i realize this is too much to expect but it would also be awesome if battery lasted at least 2 day,['battery']
1124,i can confirm from experience with the gear s3 s4 and s5 that the battery life on samsung watch is misleading i can barely get 1 5 day and this with low power mode low brightness they are not defect watch went to samsung got replacement it just how they are,['battery']
1125,this year i am getting a series 8 apple watch from a 3 so i am exited and i think they should do the band a a external battery for way better better life,['battery']
1126,a band with extra battery would be nice,['battery']
1127,i wish apple would make a fitness tracker their power efficiency in a tracker would yield awesome battery life and i just want a tracker that is optimized for apple health,['battery']
1128,thank you for the review daniel if the next iteration of apple watch include the smart connector for it wrist band it could easily incorporate battery within the band for longer use one could then swop between conventional wrist band over battery equipped one depending on use case scenario,['battery']
1129,apple will focused on battery life this time apple watch series 9 s9 chip based on 5nm technology bmi sensor new band apple watch ultra 2 s9 chip based on 3nm technology bmi sensor new color new band,['battery']
1130,hmm better battery sound great but i would also like a 44mm watch ultra the current watch ultra is too big,['battery']
1131,when the battery it s gon na last 1 week i ll buy one,['battery']
1132,i do not see the design changing anytime soon folk were predicting huge jump since the s7 and that did not happen with even with the s8 the battery life improvement would be cool but nothing worth waiting for if at all most change will probably come with the watch ultra 2,['battery']
1133,i got the ultra this year and although it wa very expensive i love it much more durable better battery life and perfect screen size,['battery']
1134,expensive it costed me a weekly income although yeah i love the alarm and the bigger case not to mention the battery it went from 100percent to 0percent in about 3 day and it charge extremely fast when i have for example 30percent i just charge it while i shower and it is already at 100percent when i put it on again,['battery']
1135,hi dan i will be upgrading next year got to keep up with the tech i am hooked now just hope battery life is better than the 8 though compared to my old 6 it is a lot better xx,['battery']
1136,i have always imagined an apple watch with smart connector and tiny battery in the strap to extend battery life,['battery']
1137,i would love to see a upgraded apple watch ultra with more battery power and few additional change to make it more interesting,['battery']
1138,it ok but the battery is terrible unfortunately,['battery']
1139,how many percent is your series 4 battery capacity after 4 year,['battery']
1140,une full day battery life amazing,['battery']
1141,if your watch is a gps model i e without cellular function or not set up with cellular it would not be able to access the internet without an iphone cellular version can but it drain your watch is battery if you have the cellular version and set up the plan you can use it stand alone for phone call streaming music with bluetooth and using map other than that you would need your iphone,['battery']
1142,how about degradation of battery in this 800 day is posible to replace it at an apple store,['battery']
1143,got mine free from apple developer academy so i am very happy i got my first ever smartwatch and i have been hearing nothing but good thing about this i do not really mind the battery life so yeahh,['battery']
1144,what is the battery health percentage after 800 day,['battery']
1145,guneet singh i used it heavily today 3 hour walk and i made it to nighttime with like 5percent of the battery so i just charge it when i sit on my desk and put it back on,['battery']
1146,doe not the cellular version finish battery quickly,['battery']
1147,how long did your battery last at the end,['battery']
1148,jstmelon loool i meant apple watch series 4 yeah no lol my iphone 12 mini ha like 5 hour sot at best and i just replaced the battery the watch easily last all day though,['battery']
1149,ballooney jr dude thats cap i have a newer samsung i think it the s7 s6 idk but the battery doesnt last 6 hour it still good but not compared to the newer phone that phone only been used a year or 2 and not even heavily it barely got used and all it wa used for wa whatsapp and youtube the battery is probably fine,['battery']
1150,well i am eating my word i did upgrade from the 7 to the 8 my battery life wa becoming wonky on my series 7 and i did not change habit or how i had my watch set up very disappointing i got a decent trade in value on the 7 and i have had my 8 now over a month and the battery life is great i have it set up the same a my 7 wa and there is a big battery difference much much better i will be keeping the 8 much longer,['battery']
1151,wohoo jessica and dustin are my fave trainer great review thank you glad you are feeling better i am looking to upgrade because i have series 4 and the battery life is not ideal for sleep tracking for health reason so highly considering upgrading do not think i need ultra but the battery life on ultra look very appealing too,['battery']
1152,this watch look good but today we see battery life in week not 7 to 14 hr,['battery']
1153,if you do alot of traning outside with gps your battery time will be much lower beacuse this year apple watch always use watch gps instead of you phone that is not good for me,['battery']
1154,i am a fan of apple product but in watch i use garmin tactix 7 pro ballistic edition it is far better than all competitor and other model in all respect especially the battery,['battery']
1155,i have a series 4 with a quickly declining battery i am a huge apple fan but the cool feature of the series 5 6 7 8 just have not been enough to justify the upgrade price without a redesign i think i will either pay for a battery replacement or go for the ultra i ski at an advanced level go backpacking hike all the time do plenty of other outdoor sport and could use the extra long battery life for long hospital shift just got ta decide if i want to pay dollar800 for that,['battery']
1156,the problem with smart watch nowadays are the battery more feature consume more battery and there are not any fast charging definitely a bummer,['battery']
1157,thanks for being vulnerable to share your health scare story i am also on daily medication so it is good to hear what is happening with watch os9 on that front with regard to the review it seems like the review wa also apple fitness in addition to the watch and i do not know that the series 8 is advertised a having any better battery life than the series 7,['battery']
1158,sandi hermana how is the battery life,['battery']
1159,the battery went from 95 to almost 30,['battery']
1160,doe the apple 1 and the apple 3 use the same battery,['battery']
1161,hi my i want to check my battery health on my iwatch4 but i do not see battery on iwatch setting can you help me to see my battery health other than that trick,['battery']
1162,apple spend dollar600 on a watch slows down 3 year later every analog watch for the last 50 yr buy a dollar10 battery every 3 year last you a life time,['battery']
1163,i had such an amazing watch but the battery expanded and pushed out the front i wa very worried that my dollar500 watch wa ruined apple very kindly offered to fix it for a mere dollar300 at the time i did not have enough money so i threw it in the bin and bought a different brand of watch for dollar20 i do not know what my heart rate is but i can at least tell the time,['battery']
1164,can anyone tell me if it ha a limited battery life like a phone and if it say it doe or not i am sorry but i do not want to watch the whole video,['battery']
1165,zaros3433k yes bluetooth must be enabled a it is the communication path between both device and yes the phone must be with you at all time in order for it to work with the exception of the time for example if you are phone is not with you or close by or the battery died the phone would still work but you will only see the clock,['battery']
1166,how do i save the battery from my apple watch,['battery']
1167,how to change battery for apple watch,['battery']
1168,in my opinion the huawei watch gt3 pro is better a a smart watch since it ha 14 day of battery life and look a lot more high end than apple watch,['battery']
1169,this is all great and amazing but completely pointless if your watch is dead p i have an apple watch love the video man just wished these watch did not have horrible battery life,['battery']
1170,well with the new watch o update you can turn on battery saving mode and it last over twice a long with no major setback other than the always on screen being turned off,['battery']
1171,reason 1 not to get an apple watch battery suck dude that model look ridiculously bigger on your wrist it is not aesthetic at all,['battery']
1172,poor battery life kill it for me a a runner,['battery']
1173,i do not get why somebody should spend 700dollar on a smartwatch that ha no special feature like e g garmins do crazy battery life ecg and generally being best fitness tracker i got a smartwatch fossil gen 5 on ebay for like 60dollar and it also feature nfc payment bluetooth unlock and even more like a full web browser or google note perfect for cheating on exam and is even supported on apple device i get why people pay a premium for a collectible watch that hold it value but a 600dollar markup just for the apple logo really is not justified at all in my eye,['battery']
1174,great watch with the worst ever battery life even a weekend outstation is impossible without the charger,['battery']
1175,battery life on it suck though,['battery']
1176,in my opinion the apple watch is no status symbol you can get an apple watch 4 or 5 for 150 200 and so almost everyone can afford it and it also no major upgrade over an series 5 or 6 same sh battery life the bigger screen is just a minor upgrade and the blood oxygen is really inaccurate the series 8 with the new design will be worth the upgrade,['battery']
1177,i am still enjoying my se just wished the apple watch had longer battery life,['battery']
1178,how is the battery on apple watch do they realistically last a complete day with heavy usage,['battery']
1179,great info an review i had 2 series of apple watch and they are sitting dusty on my drawer im not planning to buy any until they fix the main thing battery life if they can make it to last for at least a week i would be really thrilled and reconsider otherwise all the improvement just said are not really exciting to me,['battery']
1180,the battery is the let down if only apple can make it last a week i will get one,['battery']
1181,i am still rocking my series 2 apple watch and it is still good for most of these task such a unlocking a macbook paying with credit card fitness tracking messaging controlling the iphone camera and others since it is not updating the o anymore apple dropped the series 2 support it is lacking the iphone unlocking and you can not add a covid 19 certificate in the watch after 4 year of service the battery life is like new i already bought a series 7 but have not opened it yet will wait till christmas i will miss my series 2 though because i do not mind bumping it occasionally in stuff which happens,['battery']
1182,there is no chance that in 2021 or 2022 or any year anyone need a smartwatch that ha close to 1 day battery life le when you have smartwatches with more sensor and 21 day battery sapphire ceramic titanium,['battery']
1183,rare chang i same here fitbit 5 day garmin 10 day huawei 15 day and so on right now a fitbit sense doe the trick people that did not have a 1 2 week battery smartwatch can not understand i wa a watch lover before smartwatches maybe that is why,['battery']
1184,that is the only one reason why i have not got an apple watch the battery,['battery']
1185,amazing watch but there is always a but with apple the battery ohhh godddd the battery it is a kill thing,['battery']
1186,nice overview you missed one big feature on the camera app when activated from the whatch it seems to activate the wide screen lens om your iphone with the scroll wheel you can zoom the cam and the better cam quality is with the middle lens also the sound will zoom in and out with the lens change and be more detailed when you zoom to middle main objective on the iphone i am still very happy with my s5 but need bigger screen and better battery soon and awaiting new design with s8 d,['battery']
1187,bought my first ever apple watch series 7 45mm used for over a week and returned back to apple and not that impressed i think it is too expensive for what i use it for mainly use for notification apple pay check time sleep tracker and step battery is very disappointing i never use the new health feature i might get the se if i see on sale,['battery']
1188,all that feature and if you do not have the charger after about 20 24 hour of usage you just have a few hundred on your wrist if they do not improve battery life nothing else matter,['battery']
1189,wow im suprised because my old series 2 go through the whole day and i still have battery left so idk,['battery']
1190,oh you will need to charge your phone it is always low battery,['battery']
1191,why do not they just make a nice looking watch that dose notification it all most people use anyway loose all the fitness stuff most people do not want there watch telling them they do not go to the gym and them that do know what they have done loose the sleep tracking thats when it on charge loose the apps 90percent are pointless anyway make it look like a watch with the added bonus you can put them cotton strap that loop through the pin hey you might get decent battery life aswell somtimes le is more and simple is the beutifull,['battery']
1192,i feel like the most important part for the newer watch is the fast charging put it on the charger after dinner while watching show or doing dish and get it to 100percent in no time flat that way you can wear it to bed and all day the next day and it becomes more like a non 1 day battery plus sleep tracking that is the reason i will not get an se model,['battery']
1193,ultra great watch for hairdresser can not see why anyone else would be interested marketed a a great yuppie outdoor watch there are much better dedicated one out there same go for a a sport watch which serious athlete would actually wear that good battery life for the size of a brick and cellular too many hidden cost most people who would go for that would be to old to understand or use half the feature anyway like the actual look and design but still way too big,['battery']
1194,series 8 is my first apple watch my electrophysiologist fancy cardiologist at cleveland clinic wanted me to get one to monitor my heart with the ekg feature and other health feature the se wa a no go since it doe not have that feature the ultra wa a strong possibility for the added battery the brighter and bigger screen for a senior the siren for safety and of course the cool factor yes it ha a gazillion feature for pro athlete that i will never use but i am guessing just about any apple watch ha feature that some use and others do not those that think it is too big for everyday use well that is just a personal preference the only reason i did not go for it is that i am a stomach and side sleeper and it would not work well having it on my arm at night and the sleep monitoring feature is a big plus for me the 8 is a bit cumbersome at night sometimes but manageable,['battery']
1195,18 hour battery seriously,['battery']
1196,worst mistake of my life buying one of these the battery is crap their watch spend more time of the charger than on the wrist,['battery']
1197,will the lower power mode update unable more battery time on the series 7 watch,['battery']
1198,i have an iphone and a macbook pro computer i need a watch to complete the echo system but i will never buy an apple watch whose battery doe not last even a day,['battery']
1199,dear craig your video here helped me greatly i am an avid runner and almost got tricked lol into buying ultra from the hype but i tried one on at best buy and it wa unnecessarily ginormous so i just ordered a aw7 cellular dollar440 amazon now and already own a aw6 gps so i can use battery burning cell only for my 1 to 3 hour daily run thank you oh and i see my one iphone 13 pro max can be used for both watch but is the daily switching between these watch simply taking one off putting other on and passcoding in or is there more to it like in setting each time esp with cellular thank you,['battery']
1200,the apple watch ultra is amazing lasted me about a solid 36 40 hour that is including 2 sleep cycle cellular usage to send receive call away from phone and a 7 5 hour workout to continuously monitor my calorie output while at my labor intensive job on top of 2 1 5 hour workout session at the gym the battery and phone call experience a well a the bigger brighter screen alone is worth it in my opinion i comfortably used an apple watch a a phone substitute for about 2 day i am also a moderate backpacker which is just icing on the cake highly recommend,['battery']
1201,the ultra ha just come out and would not have been possible to promote 18 hour on lte in previous video no apple watch will get you continuous 18 hour lte 18 hour is apple standard battery life claim over wifi cellular eats into that total number,['battery']
1202,i do not regret getting my iwatch se with cellular version my iphone 12 mini battery died at the end of the day and i can still rely on the watch and got me entertained on podcast and messaging,['battery']
1203,i got my apple 7 watch in july after my 3rd fitbit versa failed i am addicted to the fitness and sleep tracking data so i did not want to wait for the 8 i am glad i did not wait i would have wanted the 7 over the 8 anyway and i go the cellular even though it is not activated i believe the cellular 7 battery probably last longer than the non cellular i may activate it eventually but my iphone x is nearby most of the time i wa hoping to use the apple watch a a golf gps but during a game there are so many other operation going on during the 4 hour that it make more sense just to continue with my garmin golf watch thanks for putting out great review,['battery']
1204,i wa thinking about upgrading my aw5 to aw8 but giving it a thought about few day it is not necessary what always buck me is the low battery hiking about 7 hour and the watch is dead why should i spend money on a watch that ha the same battery life a my current one the ultra look very nice but is toooo big for my small female wrist hoping the aw9 get better battery life finger are crossed then i would upgrade without hesitation,['battery']
1205,hello if i get the ultra must i buy a cellular plan for it or can i somehow use it solely with regular bluetooth because i really never leave without my cellphone anyways and i like the other upgrade of the ultra such a look style battery etc,['battery']
1206,postersm 71 ever use the ekg how is battery life i am lucky to get 18 hr but that is what is advertised at least,['battery']
1207,he always on scream look at me and drain your battery imho i have the original se and you just raise your wrist and it is on,['battery']
1208,ultra hand down my traditional watch are big and heavy this ultra will more closely match that size but with all the additional iwatch item it will replace my 6 very well it the battery life hand down that is the bonus,['battery']
1209,i think the battery life is going to be great especially with cellular too very cool you are getting one thanks for watching,['battery']
1210,battery life of 7 series v 8,['battery']
1211,but what is about yet to be launched battery saver mode for ultra amp 8,['battery']
1212,there is only one watch to buy buying anything but the ultra mean in 4 year your battery will be wearing out and you will be looking for a new watch my four year old series 5 just got traded in on the ultra because apple would not work on it yearly update are becoming so incremental that the best bet is to buy their best battery and that is the ultra and along with it you get their finest piece toughest and most unique piece of jewelry,['battery']
1213,what i noticed on the ultra model is that you probably easily can change the battery the back plane ha 4 screw since the battery last 2 time longer your battery live will theoretically last 2 x longer these more expensive watch have ecg and can now detect atrial fibrillation detecting this can save a lot of people for getting a stroke 175000 people suffer from this every year in the usa alone and the blood saturation sensor is also a killing feature it can detect sleep disorder and can be live safer long term,['battery']
1214,i have a cracked series 4 and ill be moving to the ultra i have been waiting for a longer battery better screen for a while and even thought about going to the garmin watch epix 2 the integration with the iphone ecosystem is a big driving factor for me while evaluating already have mine ordered and it will arrive mid end of october,['battery']
1215,coming from a series 6 i wanted to upgrade to something that looked slightly different i checked out the series 8 in stainless but that end up being more expensive than the ultra so might a well spend that money on the ultra since it look different is more resistant to damage and ha better battery life,['battery']
1216,the problem is they are using the same chip from watch series 6 series 7 amp 8 ultra all ha s6 chip rebranded a the s7 amp s8 i do not understand why i swear i have a very strong feel the same will be done next year i am sticking to my watch series 6 until they make a brand new chip that make it a lot better than the series 8 and ultra hopefully next year there is an s9 chip like a new s9 chip that make the battery life at least 2 and a half day without low power mode and they make the screen to body ratio higher also they need to add a couple of new feature if the series 9 add that compass feature then they will probably just add extra feature or no feature for the next ultra and wait till 2024 that is another big problem with apple there are people that hold out and wait a year more and then be disappointed and wait another year,['battery']
1217,you are right but more feature mean more battery power consumption hence poor battery life and enabling low power mode turn almost all feature off no use i think ultra would be best available option so far is not it,['battery']
1218,i bought 8 series stainless do not even bothered or thought about getting ultra because of the longer battery life and other function sitting in the office and seeing patient with aluminum or ultra look very off to me haha,['battery']
1219,i wa looking to upgrade to a series 8 but the battery health on my series 6 is still 100percent so technically a good a new i use the series 4 it replaced overnight which is showing it age maybe instead i will get an se to replace that and maybe an 8 in six month or so,['battery']
1220,my regular watch need to get a battery change so i bought a 3 series discovered if i fall and need 911 3 series can make 911 call without cellular,['battery']
1221,pebble engage utha le branded apple clone with good software and 1 year warranty 2999 only drawback below avg battery life,['battery']
1222,bhai lakin ekbar fire bolt ninja 3 full tuch screen ya wali battery ka backup mast ha or is ki quality bhi mast ha,['battery']
1223,i love my ultra and i feel naked if i am not wearing it a it can replace my phone for easy thing like call and text message i use the trail loop and the old nike sport rubber band and dress it up with a titanium band if i need to get fancy and take the wife on a date lol the battery life is my favorite thing about the watch,['battery']
1224,great review i have had it for 10 day and really enjoy it this one day battery life you can make it 2 and a half with the low power mode which i use because for me is the same do not need hr on every second ecg and blood oxygen i do not need at all especially for 150 eur more only fast charging is kind of missing p s you have to use it more for sport a well it is very good a a running and sport watch,['battery']
1225,do you think they intentionally do not make the battery last long,['battery']
1226,it is unbelievable but i still use the apple watch series 2 every day the only thing complaining about is the battery that on day when i go to the gym when i get home around 7 30 pm i need to charge it right away otherwise it work perfectly,['battery']
1227,the battery is very terrible,['battery']
1228,it is been several year that i have an apple watch s1 and s5 now am i the only one that want to just stop this apple watch is well first of all last a day of battery if you sleep with it and use it all day long and do one exercise the battery isn t there at all and the super hyper connectivity is way too much and i think that i am just gon na go for a garmin 255 that track my health and that is it and last at least 10 to 15 day of battery,['battery']
1229,need to know the battery percentage,['battery']
1230,i got the se2 about a month ago i have loved it so far in term of battery life and it is other cool feature however i am extremely disappointed in it build strength while trying to find a case for the device that i liked i got a crack on the screen from what i would call very normal every day contact did not even know it happened until the morning after never had a moment where i thought it could have happened so my first watch i ever got is already broken before even getting a month out of it it is still usable because it is just a small crack but it cover just enough of the screen to be annoying just can not believe in 2023 we still need extreme protection on device that cost hinders of dollar,['battery']
1231,i went from an se to se2 and it is definitely an upgrade best is battery life but i also love how the screen area is bigger and the shape is more smooth unless you need an ekg or aod it is the perfect watch at a really nice price i got the succulent band but do also have darker band to swap out thank you for your thought a always,['battery']
1232,jacky is bintrust me it will not make it i use my apple watch heavily and right now the battery is not doing too hot this wa before they finally added low battery i totally recommend using low battery even though the battery is 89percent it save the battery but my watch go to 10percent in just 9 hour with very heavy use,['battery']
1233,adrianna norwood i bought a used se 1 4 day ago actually arrived 2 day ago and though apple say up to 18 hour and the battery health on this thing is 89percent it definitely not living up to the standard i think it might be 18 hour with like light use but idk i do not see this thing making it past 10 or 11 without low battery mode,['battery']
1234,jacky is bin i have the first gen se i had it since it came out and the battery life suck i wish they had low power mode way earlier on the se but i have to hurry and upgrade soon because my battery is getting worse,['battery']
1235,evan maybe they used the se 1 for a while and the battery health got worse idk though it should have been similar,['battery']
1236,from the se to se2 the screen and battery life is exactly the same,['battery']
1237,first time user of the apple watch and i am loving it paying became a breeze and is my favourite function unlocking my intel imac and macbook and even my 1password manager is a close second furthermore shopping card scanning 3rd party app sleep and of course sport tracking is great too last but not least notification and simply checking the time weather etc all in all a happy user oh and by the way my apple watch last a day and a night and in the morning i still have between 50percent and 60percent battery left throwing it on the charger in the morning for an hour is more than enough to last another day so battery life is good too,['battery']
1238,lars hofman i love the battery life too the first se did not last a day,['battery']
1239,i have the iphone 13 it is really good and the battery life is amazing well worth it,['battery']
1240,"I will admitted I was a little scriptable about purchasing the apple watch, but was glad that I take that chance once I received it. Since I’ve had it I haven’t had any problems with it and the battery life on the watch is wonderful. I would say take your chances on purchasing this item if it’s something you would really like.",['battery']
1241,I ordered this Watch in excellent like new condition and it is! Works perfectly. Arrived with 80% on the battery life. Charges to 100% with no issue and lasts me 1.5 days. Screen is flawless back is flawless. Great buy! So much cheaper then buying from Apple directly.,['battery']

It came in a generic box with the watch, band, and charger (no box to plug into wall). There are no scratches and the band is new. The battery wasn’t charged and it did take 2.5 hours to get fully charged. I didn’t realize my phone didn’t have the latest iOS (16) so I did have to update my phone and that was annoying but not the sellers fault by any means. I am annoyed that I couldn’t choose the band size because the one that was sent is way too big and I’ll have to buy a new one as I didn’t see where I could contact the seller about this. I’ll update this review after I’ve had the watch for a while.",['battery']
1248,"Long story, but the price of a refurbished Apple 6 Watch was just as much as the Fi… that I returned that was a Christmas gift that didn’t even come close to having all the functions. The battery life is great; I was worried at first, but after each full day of wearing it and playing with it, by bedtime it is usually down between 68% - 64%. It works as describes, connected easy to my phone, and looks great. I don’t wear watches or jewelry to bed so I haven use the the sleep tracking. I’m trying to talk my brother into one from the same suppler. Very happy with it.",['battery']

I was skeptical and now I will only buy new!Save your money and time and just get one that actually works!,['battery']

If you aren’t wanting to splurge on a brand new watch this is definitely the way to go.",['battery']
1276,Yes battery life on the Apple Watch still not good because the Fitbit watch is 100% better than Apple Watch battery life,['battery']

1278,"I finally bought an Apple watch because I've been wanting to improve my mental health with more physical activities. At first I was annoyed by all the notifications I received on the watch; it's essentially a mirror of your smartphone. After I turned most of them off except phone calls/texts it was much better to use.While the battery life is not as long as other competition out there, there are some features that I think make the watch worth it:1. Fitness+- LOVE THIS APP! I'm currently trailing it free for 3 months, and it's a game changer. I love how there is new content weekly for different exercises like kickboxing, pilates, HIIT, yoga, dance, etc. I have a smart tv and stream the videos on there. I get to see my heart rate and calories burned LIVE, so it motivates me to work harder. You can also filter the exercises by duration, music genre, fitness instructor, and more! I will definitely be keeping the subscription after my trial is over; it''s definitely worth it.2. Daily/weekly challenges with myself and friends- I enjoy the rings concept and connecting with my friends who also have an Apple watch. I get notifications of when they complete a workout, which encourages me to exercise myself.3. Find My- I use this app constantly to find my phone in another room.4. Direct streaming to my iPhone- it is nice to see my stats on my phoneOverall, if you're considering getting an Apple Watch, do it. I selected this one because I don't need the data option, and this is a budget friendly enough device for so much value.",['battery']
1279,"Watch works fine, like all smart watches. Wish battery lasted longer.  Also wished it had a blood pressure monitor.  Have another smart watch, which was a third of the cost of the Apple Watch and it included a blood pressure monitor.  No issues with this watch so far.",['battery']
1280,Idk why it took this long to finally get one of these . So easy to set up. Looks good with the different band we got here on Amazon the apple bands are just way too much money for what they are. The battery life for my wife is OK it lasts more than a day but we charge it every day around the same time to make sure it doesn’t run out.,['battery']
1281,"I’ve had this watch for a couple of months and cannot say enough good things! It makes it easy to track your workouts and heart rate. Very easy to set up and use, not to mention the battery lasts me 2 days! Don’t know how I lived without it! Also great for easily seeing my notifications when I’m working from home! Love being able to see work things while moving around my house",['battery']
1282,"It's incredible, the product seems as good as one new and the battery health was a 100%",['battery']
1283,The watch is great for most users because it has most of the basic features you would need in a smart watch. This is especially a great buy for people on a budget. I only wished that the battery life lasted a bit longer. I have the gps only watch so I don’t know how it fares on a cellular network but it’s nice that you can walk a bit of distance from your watch and still have access to the internet. I mostly use the watch to get notifications from my phone without having to take out my phone (at work).,['battery']
1284,The battery could last longer and I don’t think I understand the feature,['battery']
1285,"I had the Fitbit Versa 2 prior to purchasing the Apple Watch SE.  I love a number of the features that I did not have before.  The integration with my iPhone and the ability to take and receive calls is great.  It senses a fall which since I am well into my senior years means a lot.  While there are an abundance of health and fitness apps for the SE I’d have to say that the Fitbit App beats anything I have found so far for the SE.  The Fitbit had a battery life that lasted about a week - the SE barely  makes it through one day if you use very many of the SE’s capabilities - a real problem if you use the sleep monitoring function.  Overall the SE is a great, solid feeling watch, but is very lacking is a couple of critical areas.",['battery']
1286,I wish battery life was better. I have turned off  a lot of notifications on this watch. But I like the idea of “fall detection” and answering phone calls and texts from my watch,['battery']
1287,"UPGRADES from Watch SE (2020):-S8 chip: Up to 20% faster than previous Watch SE in theory (previous version was using S5 chip)-Crash detection:  Will detect if you are in a crash (same tech in iPhone14 and Watch Series 8)-Price: Starts at $249, currently older Watch SE (2020) is still priced at $269Other changes:  Back of watch is no longer ceramic, now just plastic and aluminumSo, not huge changes from the previous SE really.  This watch comes with OS 9, but the older SE (2020) is also able to upgrade its software to Watch OS 9.  So far in testing, the battery life also seems to be about the same as the older SE.  So OVERALL, it does not seem to me to be worth upgrading from the old SE to this SE2.  I haven’t been able to notice much of a difference, and I actually prefer the ceramic back of the old SE (2020).  If you feel the need to upgrade from SE (2020), you might want to look at the other new Watch 8 models that have more features.----CHOOSING BETWEEN WATCH SE2 AND WATCH 8?:Compared to Watch Series 8, this SE2 is missing these features:-No ECG, No blood oxygen, No temp sensor:  These sensors on Watch 8 can provide more health data.-No fast charging:  Fast Charging is supported on Watch 7 series and Watch 8 series (including Watch Ultra).-No IP6X dust resistance:  Watch 8 has an IP6X rating, which means that it is safe from dust/debris.-No Always-On-Display:  Watch 8 has Always-On-Display.-Size:  The Watch 8 face is bigger (41mm and 45mm, vs 40mm and 44mm), but with smaller bezels; resulting in 20% more screen area on Watch 8 compared to SE2.-No U1 Ultra-Wideband: U1 chip allows for more precise location of devices, for use in multiple applications.-Battery:  Watch 8 has 308mAh battery, SE2 is listed at 296mAh (both rated 18 hours though).Currently Watch 8 is about $150 more than SE2, so it is up to you to decide if you want to spend more to get access to these additional features.  For me, the biggest noticeable differences between the two are the screen size, Always-On-Display, and charging speeds.  The Always-On-Display makes a difference of a second or two whenever you get a notification, not a huge deal but noticeable.  I also like the faster charging of Watch 8 because I usually sleep with my Watch on to get sleep tracking data, so I mainly charge during the day, and being able to do that faster means more time actually wearing the watch.Ultimately, you’ll have to decide what is important to you, and if you need an even more rugged/durable Watch for lots of rough outdoor use, there is always the Watch 8 Ultra.  Ultra is even bigger, brighter, and more durable, with a bigger battery and feature designed to cater to outdoor activities.",['battery']
1288,"The Apple Watch is great and the features are very good.  However the battery life is not very good.  I have to recharge it every night.  I thought the battery would last at least a couple of days, but I have to charge it every night so I am unable to have it record my sleep patterns.",['battery']
1289,"The battery in my old watch I have had 5 or more years and that battery is going strong on that and it only cost $55  and this apple watch was almost $300 and the batter needs charged every 12 hours or 24 or it dead..... being it cost $300 almost, the battery should last 10 years or more before a charge",['battery']

1291,"I recently decided to pass along my Series 3 as an entry level gift to my parent. The watch is pretty, sleek, and well designed. There's no doubt about that. It's just about the same exact watch, with a few additional features that aren't all that revolutionary. The battery life is about the same as well, if not worse. I charge it and the battery is already 45% through half a day. My 3 was lasting all day and would end up about 60% by the time I lay down.Overall, I'm neutral on this device. It's nice, though, but I slightly regret passing off my old watch.",['battery']
1292,this watch is perfect….i had previously purchased an apple 4 cellular watch brand new for about $500 bucks …watch os7 trashed my battery life…i was charging that watch twice daily….(i feel apple knew what the problem was but didn’t care…i got absolutely no help from them at all)…so i decided to get a new watch but as cheap as i could because i will NEVER spend big bucks on apple products again…enter se 2 gen watch and it is just what my other watch used to be….i can even wear this for over two days and still have about 25 to 30 percent battery…true this does not have the ekg thing my 4 did but who cares…if that is important to you go with it…not for me..i wanted battery life….i will now keep apple care for as long as i have this watch but i loved the fact that this was so inexpensive (235.00) compared to what i paid for the other one…,['battery']
1293,"I bought this watch after being a Fitbit user for years & my last watch absolutely died! I was conflicted on either staying with Fitbit or getting an Apple Watch.I have Apple accessories, so it only made sense to stay in the family, right?!Shopped around for the right Apple Watch, for me. And since I am big into fitness, I needed another watch-pronto! Hence, Amazon!When I came across this beauty, I read the reviews, saw the Apple warranty and decided to go for it!Price was decent. Delivery time was great! And, the color of both the watch and band were nice!When it arrived a couple days after purchase, I felt like a little kid on Christmas!It took me a second, though, to learn this new device’s ins-and-outs. But after I did, I now ask myself what took me so long to switch!?Even though the battery life isn’t perfect (a day and a half), it’s not bothersome due to its other great features.The best feature so far to me is the dial-I can control my AirPods volume with it! Amazing I tell ya! I’m hooked on this watch now, and you will be too-LOL!",['battery']
1294,"I felt this was the best value for my money.  I was already familiar with my earlier apple watch so the mobile app was good and easy to use just like with my series 2.  If you are considering this watch look at the difference between the SE and 8 or 8 plus.  Further, if battery life is an issue the 8 plus offers  by far the longest battery life. They have the always on face and a couple of features which the SE does not. The always on face and other features were really not important to me.  However, go to the Apple Website and look at the feature comparisons.  They may very well be worth you spending a little more money for the upgrade.  You can't go wrong with an Apple watch just make sure you get the watch you want with the features that are important to you.",['battery']
1295,"I am so happy I bought my Apple Watch. Overall I love my watch for keeping track of exercise and taking incoming calls and texts. I feel like it helps me stay off my phone but aware if someone messages me. I know someone with an older version and I can definitely tell the difference in speed while doing normal typing/ scrolling etc. I am glad I got this one due to the not lagging speed compared to other. I can get two days battery life out of my Apple Watch. The charge is fast, but extended battery life is always a plus for future improvements.",['battery']
1296,"Im not up to date on technology, but the watch was easy to set up. The battery life is great. Still exploring its capabilities on the watch. All in all i loving it!",['battery']

The second watch I didn't even take it out of the box as it was missing a strap.I set it up a bit before send it back because the box was open and didn't look like it was new.It may be an issue with the specific seller, can't say, but out of 2 purchases, both arrived not sealed.",['battery']
1298,"I got this watch for a very affordable price as a Christmas gift. While it’s doesn’t light up all the time, I’m happy as it gives me privacy and improves the battery life. As an introduction into Apple Watch, this is a great watch to start.",['battery']
1299,"The battery lasts for about 2 days with everything turned off and minimal use, less than a day with every function on. I feel like we can do better, but here we are. I like it and basically use it to track exercise, steps, and sleep. It seems to be pretty accurate. I don’t think I’ll replace it when it doesn’t update anymore.",['battery']

1307,The battery life in this Apple Watch is honestly the best! I would totally recommend this Apple Watch in particular.,['battery']
1308,"The Apple Watch is amazing! Can’t stop recommending this watch. The only small thing that kind of sucks is the battery life. I have to charge it almost everyday. I work intensely for almost 12hrs per day, so I like to keep tracking of the amount of steps I walk per day. However, I couldn’t finish the 12hrs because the battery lasts around 10hrs if you turn the power-saving mode around 50%.",['battery']
1309,I'm not a techno guy.  Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Said it worked with the iPhone SE.  Problem was her phone was a first gen iPhone SE.  Obviously we needed to upgrade phones so we did that.  But the watch needs charged just about every day.  Very disappointed in battery life.,['battery']

It works perfectly and I've been enjoying using the watch to track my workouts. I'm very impressed by the condition of this watch and I wonder why anyone would get one brand new! The battery life health was at 83%, which is expected from a previously owned watch but it's enough to last me throughout the workday and into the evening. It charges quickly and the charge it came with works great. The band is also comfortable when I wear it at the gym and easy to put on. I would definitely recommend this.",['battery']

1315,"I was hesitant to purchase as I had bought a ""refurb"" Apple Watch previously, however, this one is a MUST BUY! The previous version I had purchased had battery issues and would not last through a day. The battery on this lasts at least a day and a half with heavy use. I receive messages via MS Teams all day at work, workout, and walk a ton for my job. Apple fitness is a game changer and beats any fitness app i've used. Provides simple information and goals to strive for. Thoroughly satisfied with my purchase!",['battery']

Screen is still in perfect condition, charger works as it should, lifetime battery says 98%, took no time at all to link up with my phone, and SO MUCH cheaper than buying brand new.

1318,This is my very first Apple Watch. I really like it. The only thing is it came with many scratches and one gouge. I was very excited to receive it and immediately started learning all about it. The next day I then realized I should of contacted the company and let them know of the scratches but by that time I had invested my time and info into the Watch. I honestly did not want to start all over. That was my only reason for not contacting the company to send it back. Lesson learned. All in all I love the color and it’s performance. The battery only lasts me for a day.,['battery']
1319,"It has all of the features that I need that my Watch many years ago did not. My last one was new, but refurbished is fine. Especially due to the difference in cost.What I am hoping to find online is a way to have the Battery last longer.For now, I’m going to wear it when I need to the most, so can charge as necessary.I DO know that Bluetooth drains battery. I’m going to try to remove apps that I don’t want right now to see how much that helps.",['battery']
1320,"I'm not sure why I waited to get an Apple watch to go with my other Apple products... maybe the price. This refurbished has been perfect. I could live with the price. It's been dependable. And it's made receiving messages so convenient. I don't sleep with it on because I don't want to ""feel"" the notifications. So the battery life has been a non-issue. I charge it at night though it's rarely below about 65%. I'm very happy I finally got one and got this one. (I have a tiny wrist, so I had to buy a stretchable replacement band, as this one was too big and the watch was not against my wrist.)",['battery']
1321,"I am really impressed with this refurbished Apple Watch SE. I had been idly considering purchasing an Apple Watch for a year and when I saw this, I jumped on it even though I saw the SCATHING reviews regarding the battery life.REGARDING THE BATTERY LIFE:I found that right out of the box, the Apple Watch *did not* preform with the battery life as advertised. It only lasted about 3-4 hours fully charged.HOWEVER, after going through and TURNING OFF background app refresh and other background processes, as well as REMOVING UNNECESSARY APPS, the BATTERY LIFE IMPROVED DRASTICALLY. It has NOT EVEN hit 75% after a FULL 8 HOURS. I think the battery life is really impressive!COSMETICALLY:This watch is in REALLY GOOD condition considering it is secondhand/refurbished. I received mine with only ONE TINY CHIP to the screen.**I genuinely think this is not a watch to pass up. If you’re considering it, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going through all of the apps that come on it and remove unnecessary ones as well as turning off any background processes. That should improve battery life amazingly.**Thank you!",['battery']
1322,"I bought the excellent condition refurbished SE and it came quickly in the mail, but it was free-floating in a small FedEx box(there wasn’t even bubble wrap around the actual watch piece), leaving a ton of opportunities for damage to occur. I saw some people received there’s in the original apple box, but that wasn’t the case for me. It arrived completely dead and not fully updated, which was simple to deal with but just a little bit of an inconvenience. On the plus side, the battery capacity was at 100%, which is great for a refurbished piece, maybe they replaced the battery. The glass screen of my watch also has a fairly large scratch on it, which was disappointing because I paid the extra money for “excellent condition”, and I personally wouldn’t consider it excellent. My watch didn’t come with the user manual, which I solved by just using the apple store website, but it would’ve been nice to have.Overall, this is a great option to save money but be weary of how it ships, I definitely think this store should invest in better shipping products (so that they aren’t liable for damage during shipping when the product was maybe in perfect condition before it was sent out)! The watch works fine and has great battery health, just a bit upset about the scratch since I paid for the excellent condition.",['battery']
1323,"Overall the watch is great. It looks new and works great. Only reason I gave it three stars was because the battery is horrible. I fully charged it when I received it. Only wore the watch 4 hours and barley used it and when I got home my battery was at 20%. Now I have to purchase a new battery , which I should not have to do seeing as I just bought this watch a couple days ago.",['battery']

1325,"I bought this Apple Watch for my son. So far it works fine, the charger that was sent for it seemed cheap but he used his old charger. The battery health is at 90% capacity when sent. The other thing is I bought this one thinking GPS meant you can use Apple Maps without wifi, it just means u can track you’re distance during workouts or whatnot. I would recommend.",['battery']
1326,"I'm enjoying my refurbished Apple Watch.  My only complaint is that the battery life is only around 20hrs.  I'd like to wear it to track my sleep but then I wouldn't be able to wear it the next day without having it charge for an hour or so.But other than that, I'm enjoying it.",['battery']
1327,Used religiously since purchase (not very long ago) and now the battery won't charge past 80% anymore and dies very very quickly.,['battery']
1328,Great watch for the price. I didn’t need it to be cellular. Fast delivery too. Once I figured stuff out the battery life has been great. (Was on it a lot when I first got it),['battery']
1329,The watch is great. Does what it needs to do. BUT the battery is absolutely trash. Took forever to get to a full charge but then died after 3 HOURS. Im so mad.***update*** so i ended up updating the watch and it works just fine.,['battery']
1330,"After a few years of wanting this watch, I went for it when I saw this great price.The watch looks pristine and the battery life is excellent.At time of writing (September 2022), you can have offline Spotify, and Apple now provides estimated vo2 max, and heart zone training alerts - in addition to the normal sleep tracking, run tracking, and so on.What an awesome fitness accessory, a great $180 spent.",['battery']
1331,"I bought this as an upgrade from my FitBit.It not only works with Apple Health but also with Lose-It which I use for tracking nutrition, sleep and exercise.It’s easy to set up and use. I do pop it onto the charging stand every night so I’ve never experienced any battery life issues, but I did go several days in a row without charging when I first hot it; again no problems.It is synced with my iPhone so I never miss a text, event or call.It reminds me to stand, move, and exercise (it did that just now!).My only complaint is that the large watchband included with the watch is not large enough. The watch band vendors, including Apple, seem to think that people who buy 40mm watches have small wrists.If your wrist is over 8” in circumference and you want a iWatch SE, buy the 44mm iwatch.This is a good, helpful, well-performing device.I recommend it.",['battery']
1332,"Product came in looking brand new.  No scratches or even dust on the watch itself, and the battery has 100% of its life.  The watch was updated to WatchOS 8.6, so after updating to 8.8(current at time of writing), the watch worked as expected.  I’m upgrading from a FitBit Blaze, and it is a massive upgrade.  Only came with S/M bands, which barely fit my wrist, but other than that it is perfect.  Also, it includes a USB-C charger, rather than a USB-A so keep that in mind when buying.",['battery']
1333,Absolutely love this watch and so glad I didn’t have to pay a lot for it! It came in the normal packaging and everything is in perfect condition. So so happy with it. Originally I was nervous because it seemed like the battery life wasn’t very good but after a full charge it lasts a long time.,['battery']
1334,"So I’ve read multiple reviews about how it was iCloud activation locked, but when I got mine it worked perfectly with no trouble at all now I haven’t tested the battery but at this point In time I believe that it will last two days, only reason I’m giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because I received the band box and the Apple Watch box without the main box that holds them together, the packaging  for both boxes looked excellent, but as soon as I opened it the packaging looked ripped, I’m pretty sure Renewed Apple watches need to be sealed back up to ensure quality, but it’s whatever I got a perfect band, and almost brand new Apple Watch considering it’s been used!!!",['battery']
1335,"I went from the Apple Watch 3 to the SE version, and it’s absolutely perfect. I didn’t need the GPS or extra things that come with the 7 so this was the clear option. Works very well, battery could be better but if you turn off the heart rate it wll last more than 24/hrs",['battery']
1336,Watch face is in new like condition and it came with a new looking cord but in a plain cardboard  box not an apple box like I was hoping for. Works fine battery life is ok a little less than my other watch.,['battery']
1337,Product very clean and almost brand new. Updated the watch like suggested but the battery still seems to drain really fast.My last watch lasted at least 2 days and I’m lucky if I get through a day (not including night) on one charge.,['battery']
1338,my daughter wears this on schooltime mode during the day yet when she gets home from school it only has like 20% battery life.  constantly  have to charge it.  poor battery life.,['battery']
1339,"FYI You need iPhone and a wall charger, but I knew that going in.I received the package fast and secured. I had to charge the watch for 30 minutes before syncing it with my phone. The battery works great and I got great use out of it on the first day! It came with two bands of different sizes and it works great. I did have to turn off the zoom setting on the watch. Overall 10/10 experience. I love all the information that comes with it about how it's a refreshed or refurbished item and its warranty. Thank you so much!",['battery']
1340,"Best purchase in a long time, the apple watch just look like a brand new one, no scratches at all, came in a original apple box, 100% battery life and ready to link to your apple ID, works perfectly after 1 month, and just $199 for SE model with free shipping.",['battery']
1341,"Ordered the one with the abyss blue band, but instead they sent a white. They don't even show a white-banded one on their listing so I don't know what's up with that. Otherwise it's absolutely fine: 90% battery health, a few minor blemishes on the back of the casing (which are invisible when wearing), and no conspicuous issues with the hardware or software.",['battery']
1342,I hated it because the battery drained so fast and I thought it might even be defective. I looked up a lot of guides on turning off certain settings that aren't important to me and my battery lasts a whole day even with a workout now.,['battery']
1343,"I was worried that bc it was a renewed product I wasn’t going to be satisfied. That it would perform at lower quality than new. I was wrong, it was in perfect condition it has held the battery life and works great. Very happy with my decision to buy renewed.",['battery']
1344,"here in my country the same watch is around 450 usd, here I bought mine for 197 usd with 100% battery life. Basically new. Love it",['battery']
1345,"i liked everything! the battery life is great, the mobile set up was amazing and it’s very easy to configure, all around a great product for the low price!",['battery']
1346,The battery only lasted about 5 hours so I had to return the watch unfortunately.,['battery']
1347,"I’m very happy with my purchase, the Apple Watch didn’t come in the original box but all the accessories were original. It didn’t have any scratches, battery life was 100%. Unfortunately, I had an error because I couldn’t activate the watch using my phone, it said “Unable to Check for Updates” but I went to an Apple Store and they kindly help me to solve and it works perfectly now. The product is literally new and it helped me save a couple of dollars. I would totally recommend buying Amazon renewed products, it worths the price.",['battery']
1348,The watch I received came pretty much brand new in undamaged separate pieces in bubble wrap. I was able to put it together and pair it with my iPhone easily. The battery capacity is still at 100% after a week. It’s like I got a new Apple Watch SE for almost half the price. Thank you!,['battery']
1349,Item arrived as described so far very good. In original packaging apple was able to get battery charged to 100% no issues or concerns yet- have only had item for 2 days. Great value for $ like new,['battery']
1350,"I recently purchased the iWatch Series 3. Liked it, but the iWatch SE has better battery life. Most impressive is that everything on screen seems larger- I can read the news, texts,, books etc…I can appreciate being able to see the many features offered by this watch. Easy pairing and transfer of information from the 3. Thank you to all who conceptualize thourgh production to the market.",['battery']
1351,The Apple Watch SE came in the original packaging. The watch band box had never been opened. The watch was easy to set up and not connected to anyone’s ID as mentioned in previous posts. The battery life is at 100%. The watch itself looked brand new. I added a different band and a protector so I don’t scratch it. All in all this was a great deal and it’s been working great in the week that I’ve had it.,['battery']
1352,Bad battery,['battery']
1353,"Got what we expected, a refurbished watch in good condition, battery life could be better but very happy with price/quality",['battery']
1354,Charged right up and paired with my phone. Tracks activity well. So far so good on the battery life. I’m super impressed and really love it!,['battery']
1355,"The watch looks like new, no scratches and battery lasts a long time",['battery']
1356,"My daughter was super excited about her watch, but after fully charging, the battery only lasted 2 hours. I checked all the settings to make sure they matched how mine are set on my watch, & she tried wearing it again the next day. The battery only lasted 4 hours. We are returning the watch, & we’re hoping for better luck with another one. Everything else was great except a small scratch on the screen that you couldn’t see after we put a screen protector on.  It did not come in original packaging, but it was packaged well. It came with a large band, which was too big for her wrist but an easy fix to buy a small band at Walmart. Overall, I’m only giving it one star because if the battery doesn’t last more than a couple hours, the watch is useless",['battery']
1357,They installed the battery magnet backwards so it repels the charger. The fact this got sent out without being checked beats me.  I wouldn’t not trust any product from them given they obviously do not QC there products,['battery']
1358,It look like new but battery life is bad can’t even last a day,['battery']
1359,"I had been wanting the raved about Apple Watch for a LONG time. I had A FitBit Versa 2 and said when it died I’d break down and spend the $$$ to get an Apple Watch… I was NOT impressed. The workout tracking is subpar, the sleep tracking was difficult to even view (and fitbit gives me averages for the whole week, etc)… if you’re a lady they have the “cycle tracking” but it is not nearly as accurate as FITBiT. I have been an Apple user for a long time (I won’t be giving up my iPhone any time soon) but I was highly disappointed with the Apple Watch. Also, the battery barely lasted a little over a day, I can go 3-4 days without ever charging my Fitbit! I have returned the Apple watch and switched back to a Fitbit Versa 3 (my Versa 2 lasted me 4 + years).",['battery']
1360,Looks brand new. Came in a sealed box. The battery life ran out quite quickly. Less than a day so that’s concerning. And to kick the charger that was included doesn’t work. Or atleast I hope it’s the charger. Will update when I spend $30 on a new one today. Pretty upset about that as I went with this refurbished model to save money.,['battery']
1361,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The screen was glued on so bad and the battery was dead.  Cheap but not worth it if it’s a gift for someone special. If you want okay quality buy a more expensive watch 🥹",['battery']
1362,This watch is of terrible quality with deep scratches on the face and back. It's so scratched the face is hardly visible. The battery doesn't stay charged for more than 4 hrs no in use just on my hand.Avoid this seller.,['battery']
1363,Watch works really well. This is the second Apple Watch I’ve had and I love them. The downfall that I’m seeing with this watch is that the battery does not last. Last night I went to bed with the battery at 80 percent and I woke up with it dead. It’s supposed to be on my wrist more than the charger but that doesn’t seem to be the case with this one.,['battery']
1364,Watch looks brand new and everything seemed fine until I started using it and....... the battery life is terrible!!!It only lasts about 2 hours while tracking a workout and then it dies. Even when I put it on airplane mode it dies super quick.Terrible battery life. Super frustrated with this purchase.,['battery']
1365,I love the gorgeous red of this watch. The watch was packaged nicely. The instructions were easy to follow. This watch is so much more advanced than my Fitbit. I love all the numerous features and learn something new and cool every day about it!  I was surprised by the battery life but it makes sense since I have it set to flash on at every movement but it charges incredibly fast! I was shocked when I realized my iPhone charger block wouldn’t have the same connections for me to charge my watch. I was able to find an adapter on Amazon pretty easily.,['battery']
1366,"I'm not sure if it's just me, but the battery life sucks. It lasts about a day a half, and that's with turning off at night. You really can't use it during the day and expect to use the sleep tracking and health tracking features at night because it would need to be charged the next day. My series 3 had a much better battery life.",['battery']
1367,"As a fan of the Apple Eco-system (iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch) I upgraded to Series 8 for the features that involve your health. The heart and fitness information is exactly what I was looking for. The battery is long lasting (up to two days) so I can wear it all night (when it once detected Afib) and charge it for an hour or so in the morning. Everything you like about Apple Watch is here, and more.",['battery']

1369,"Great size, and great Apple item, but battery life too short.",['battery']
1370,"Love my Apple Watch.  There are so many features to figure out.  I like that Mini Mouse will tell me the time.  Use Low Power Mode to extend battery life.  Mostly got it for the sleep, steps, health features and especially for asking, then calling someone if I fall down.",['battery']
1371,"The Apple Watch series 8 is an all around great smart watch, especially if you are involved in the Apple ecosystem. It has solid battery life, easily making it through a full day off one charge. The apps available are quite convenient and make you feel much less of a need to pull out your phone constantly throughout the day. I initially did not think much of the car crash safety feature, but I've got to admit there is something comforting about knowing your watch can act as a life alert help signal in the event of a car crash. Hopefully I never need to rely on that feature but it is comforting to know it is there. The health features like the blood oxygen monitor are also quite useful, and supposedly the monitor as reliable as a medical-grade device according to a recent study in the Digital Health open access journal.Overall I am quite pleased with this smart watch and think it was a fantastic purchase.",['battery']
1372,"I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven't had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch's ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn't really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night.",['battery']
1373,"I finally gave up on my Fitbit. Too many little things. I resisted the Apple Watch for many years due to the short battery life. I use my watch for both health and sleep tracking, so wanted a once-a-day charge schedule.This watch delivers!  Because there is no Cell Radio, after 24 hrs I still have 40% battery left!  This is useable and I’m very pleased.",['battery']

1376,I had an Apple Watch 3 so this was a great upgrade. It has an abundance of Watch faces and can be customized. There are so many things it does that I am constantly finding new uses. Especially as it relates to health. The only drawback as always is the battery life. It does last longer than my Apple Watch 3 by several hours. So far I am very impressed. It is not cheap but you get what you pay for with all the features it contains.,['battery']
1377,i got this as a christmas present for my mom. she loves it so much!! it came really quick. the apple box wasn’t damaged in any way. she only had it for a couple days but her sleep tracking is very accurate & the battery life has lasted her a long while. i highly recommend!,['battery']
1378,Nice watch and worth the money with great battery life. Except when click an album and choose a song it will not play on my phone and it lowers the volume,['battery']

I bought the watch and skipped the iPhone 14. This wears comfortably on my wrist. I have not had any issues yet. Love this watch, my favorite Apple product.",['battery']
1383,"I gave away my Series-7 to a family member and got the Series-8.  It really is a very minor update over the Series-7.  While the Series-8 includes a new “temperature” sensor, the Series-7 comes with lots of color options that matches your style and taste.  In all honesty, the “temperature” feature is not even what you expect it to be, I thought it could track my actual temperature and it would tell me if I’m getting a fever or something.  It doesn’t do that, it was meant to track “ovulation.”  As a male, it is pointless, I would rather have the color options.  Additionally, in terms of accuracy, sleep tracking, and battery life, it is just ok.  It is no better than the Series-7 in terms of battery life, the accuracy of readings and sleep tracking is ok at best.  I love apple products but it really isn’t as accurate as I would like it to be.  Just keep your expectations reasonably low and you won’t be disappointed.",['battery']
