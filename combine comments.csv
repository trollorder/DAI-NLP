0,check out juuk is premium apple watch band use the promo code maxtech for 10percent off your order i got the qrono korza and ruby grey vitero juuk band

2,very good review thank you for this
3,i just got an 8 and i am very happy with it the ultra is overkill for me
4,help me a lot thanks
5,john mayer sent me
6,series 7 an ultra strap case
7,the value calculation just changed for me new 41m series 8 discounted by dollar70 00 dollar329 00 purchase price on amazon series 8 fit my main requirement comfy form factor i can listen to music while running hiking and the oxygen sensor will be nice when hiking above the treeline
8,my grandma ran over my fitbit versa 2 today so looking for a replacement
9,he make the ultra actually seem worth it
10,u know whats funny to me is the fact that i saw and had an iwatch in 2009 and the actual brand one came out first a iwatch in april 2015 thats why i always say all the best new tech is given to wealthy or company people and later through the year to the public
11,800 dollar tho thats steep
12,i love the fact your sponsor is actually pertain to your subject matter thank you for that
13,i do not want a watch phone or anything tracking my ovulation i just want one for travel and workout i have the first apple watch which i have not used in years
14,there is literally nothing that justifies buying the other two model over the se 2 unless you have serious health problem
15,apple watch have pretty robust body but the battery life are very short compared to android smartphones so apple watch engineer ought to consider it and must improve lot longer battery life other wise apple watch sell might fall dramatically
16,just got the ultra love it
17,i recently purchased the ultra watch and just love it battery is amazing and screen size is nice to interact with apps definitely would recommend
18,i got the series 8 45mm for dollar329 at best buy a an open box but sealed originally bought the red it wa locked
19,you sound like you should be on an infomercial
20,i really want to believe this guy still talk like this in his real life like ordering starbucks in that half whisper intentionally slowed down pace
21,a if i have dollar800 dollar on me lol
22,can this watch send have reminder for appointment like from calendar and such
23,i believe the stainless steel model also have sapphire crystal display rather than glass not just the ultra
24,i want the ultra but 900 dollar i can not justify buying that lol
25,i still have the series 1 it is still working strong but a new watch will be refreshing
26,i am considering getting the se gen 2 it seems simple and just perfect for what i need i do not need all the extra stuff they have added tbh
27,so se series 8 thicc ultra
28,so wait which one do y all reccomend series 7 or 8
29,tohuwabohu dislike
30,did you used to make motorcycle video
31,oh baby yes
32,please stop yelling we can hear you
33,great service and video thanks
34,why are all smart watch just glorified fitbits they all have like the same 11 feature and some let is you call and text that is it
35,i had a couple thing about the ultra that made me decide against buying it the biggest issue wa it is large to fit comfortably on my wrist and the watch can be a bit heavy the thing also wa the ultra wa hard to put under my long sleeve shirt i have smaller then normal hand and wrist for a man and the ultra wa just to large heavy and awkward for me being that i am retired and wanted an apple watch to monitor my heart and temperature reading i went to the series 8 41 mm i do not need cellular connection on the watch a i have my phone with me all the time i just could not justify spending another dollar120 00 a year added to my cellular plan and having a extra dollar100 00 for the watch the ultra is just not what i wanted and the se just wa not enough i also do not really have a use for the stainless model so i went with the aluminum the way to save money is also fish for the discount and by a short fishing trip over to the apple veteran and military website i found 10percent off on the site so that dollar400 00 watch wa dollar360 00 the ultra is just to much and the se not enough and the series 8 wa just right my pervious apple watch wa the original version that lasted until last month before the battery died so this wa a nice update
36,good presentation
37,my first apple watch is the series 8 i know it is not a lot of change but it is a perfect first watch for me it is my third day having it and i adore it sm already
38,reduce your coffee intake
39,im sold on the series 7 because it pretty cheap now and it basically the same a the s8
40,i might get the series 6
41,i wished the ultra got a faster chip s6 chip is starting to feel slow especially when using night sky which slightly lag at time
42,tyler cost
43,i am not a smart watch person just shopping for mom what throw me off is why they have been using the same chip for so long if the battery last le than a day
44,saying the most expensive apple watch at dollar800 is the best bang for your buck doe not make this guy look good tbh 6 40 thank you for admitting this wtf do you know what bang for your buck mean 99percent of people do not go scuba diving and do not need a diving computer lol how doe this model best bang for your buck wat
45,it would be interesting to see how the older apple watch with the apple s6 cpu perform wondering if apple intentionally slows them down to get customer to buy the new one with the rebranded cpu in them if they are all basically s6 cpu the old watch should be working perfectly fine very sus to rebrand the same chip to make it look like it is an upgrade
46,just a quick note every new apple watch ha bt 5 3 not only the ultra like you said
47,nice review i do disagree that the ultra is the best value ultra ha 2x battery 2x screen brightness 2x water resistance basically twice a good a the se in almost every way yet almost 3x the price plus there is definitely a market for people who would want the ultra but do not like the huge size if apple make the ultra in a smaller size and cheaper that would be a home run imo
48,price making doe not really follow a preliminary correlation with performance lol
49,dollar700 who wear watch to check the time just look at your iphone lol i rather get newest iphone
50,great video my friend just bought the 6 just because i felt i needed the ecg
51,i purchased the series 7 in stainless steel for dollar410 to upgrade from my aw se 1 which wa scratched up it is perfect for me a i do care about aesthetic a much a functionality i think it strike lovely balance between the two
52,i own an apple watch series 0 a watch that came out same year a iphone 6 or 7 plus imagine if apple turned of basic function and connection option for those phone that is what apple just did turned off basic function for my otherwise working and mint condition series 0 apple watch it is not supported in io 16 1 i got a new phone and after automatic installing io 16 1 1 basic function on old apple watch is no longer working basically everything that require connection to the phone is no longer working fitness sync notification weather complication and other complication etc basically everything that also us the watch app on phone so they more or le bricked my watch at the push of a button why it the first time i have seen an apple product become completely useless after 7 year and they choose to do it on a watch the watch wa working just fine before the update yes it did not have the new function but it wa just fine i called support and after a long chat they decided to compensate me with a link to recycle the watch so they brick my watch and sent me a link to recycle the watch after that they semt me a link to apple store watch page so i could buy a new one at full price what is going on here can apple just do that in my ear it sound crazy that they can just do that please help
53,if your aftermarket band damage the detent for the watch and wont come off apple will not work on your watch
54,thank you just bought a series 7 through your link
55,ive had my series 7 a while now a my first apple watch and i wear it everyday and sometimes i have it off and sometimes feel like i got a notification but i havent got the watch on me lol doe anyone else feel this
56,thanks for sharing you clarified many thing in a good way
57,well how do i get my mom to buy this
58,just praising the ultra and telling people to get the se if they do not want the ultra not much of a buyer guide
59,a richard millie watch cost over 1million dollar this is dollar800 i am going with apple
60,help i do not know which watch to get either the apple watch se or se generation 2
61,one interesting feature of an apple watch is that it tell the time
62,i wish all review were a helpful a this you made it easy for me to choose thank you and well done
63,i just purchased this for a decent price and it come with the cellular option which i will not use i am assuming the watch will operate the same right
64,u just promoted ultra here and spoke nothing about the other totally not compatible with the caption
65,keep it real bro the ultra is like wearing a t w steele watch on your hand shit look like you are wearing a wall clock on your wrist
66,dick tracy wud be proud
67,is this a tech channel or qvc
68,to be honest i just want a series 7 with the battery life of a ultra
69,i wanted the ultra because it would fit with my lifestyle but it is way to big for my tiny wrist
70,also the ultra is an amazing watch but you are right that big face is just too much but i do love the button and function of it
71,yes they have hnmm mmmm i kind of want the hermes watch for the box and re sale
72,dollar800 for a smartwatch do you think people sleep on money apple wa a one of first company to introduce a dollar1 000 smartphone now apple will be the first company to introduce dollar1 000 smartwatch
73,i really wish they would come up with a 43 46 mm option for the ultra i will probably end up buying the ultra regardless but there are a lot of athletic people out there that have small wrist and 49mm plus the additional thickness can look and feel quite daunting
74,sticky da plug there is a setting that allows you to switch the orientation while keeping it on the same wrist you can make it so that the crown face away from your hand
75,i love mine but it is a fact especially doing push ups the crown press my hand but if u raise it on the wrist a bit above the wrist bone it is actually no problem then
76,did you say ovulation tracking
77,the standard apple watch ha not had a good upgrade for a while now
78,why is the ultra 900dollar it is a ducking watch so dumb should not be more then 500
79,i just got the series 8 45mm for me and dad but still do not know how to use it yet lol
80,i find it funny that now that these watch were first announced to come out my series 4 wa updated and now it ping every so often when it is on the charger like it is disconnecting then connecting back anyone else experiencing this
81,thanks for the good advice about purchasing but why are you yelling
82,is the always on display really that useful or useless how often do you use it
83,dollar800 might a well get a phone
84,ugh i can not watch this guy anymore he is such an apple shill the se is the best watch bang for the buck genius but you got to sell that ultra do not you
85,great video buddy new subscriber
86,the ultra is indeed a better buy but only if it came in a smaller size even at 45mm i have the series 7 gps cellular 41mm and the crash detection is a big difference between the two along with the temperature sensor for those two reason alone i recently ordered the 8 gps cellular 41mm and will either sell or give away my 7 despite just having bought it in july and i wish they would free up on one or two of the herm s watch face
87,hello susana i would like to buy a series 7 gps cellular where are you from
88,dollar800 for a apple watch
89,id love the se it sound super useful and nothing too crazy i had a dream last night that i got one love being poor
90,i have the apple watch 3 definitely time for a upgrade so i am going for apple watch 8
91,i am still using the series 4 but that ultra doe look nice update got the ultra and it is pretty cool but the battery dy significan notly faster while using cellular
92,it last up to 3 day
93,what watch to get for first time apple watch buyer
94,i do not get it what is the surprising thing
95,thanks for helping with my decision i am going with the ultra
96,i just upgraded to an apple watch series 8 from my series 6 and i got ta say the battery life seems much better i wore it from 3am to 10pm and had 54percent charge remaining and that is not on battery saver mode
97,apple tell you the ultra is for exploring in the middle of nowhere how do you do that with 38 hour of battery at most my garmin give me over 12 day in normal mode to me it is absurd
98,apple say 100 mt water resistant i am a scuba diver and for my sport it 40 mt sorry it is either 100 mt or 40 mt
99,i upgraded from series 6 to se 2 and love it got the midnight black 44 mm got it for same spec a the 8 for lower price
100,that is a downgrade friend
101,wait for next year model the apple watch will have the same feature a the ultra but smaller and le expensive
102,max tech this is the first time i have buy a apple watch so i am getting an apple watch se2
103,did you make a mistake at 3 32 battery size of watch 8 45mm only 3 4 of watch 7 45mm
104,what about the series 6 if they all have the same chip what feature is the 6 missing
105,stefan w i wa looking to upgrade from an apple watch 4 so the 6 cellular for dollar240 on amazon renewed sound like a good deal to me
106,7 wa a minor upgrade to 6 8 an even minor to 7 same cpu since 6 not even shrinked to 5nm still 7nm so no better battery display a little bit smaller but who care will stick to my 6
107,i love to hate fanboy max
108,se 2 v series 7 at the same price series 7 probably cheaper mmmmh opinion
109,it gon na be my 1st smart watch tat i own but since i dun wan the aluminium model my next option is only stainless steel or ultra but the price difference is only about dollar100 so it totally not worth it to get the stainless steel when i can just get the ultra for like dollar100 more but one dilemma i have is it gon na be heavier more bulky and i like the series 8 design a little better coz im a pretty skinny guy
110,lol i have the same issue i prefer the 8 stainless steel but it is almost the same price a the ultra which ha twice a battery
111,the ultra cost 1000euros in europe battery last hardly a day that s insane shame on you tim cock
112,dollar800 lol
113,no thanks io and the apple watch will lock me down to apple forever
114,i need the series 8 from my series 6 i want the ultra at amp t is having a bogo buy a series 7 and get a se free
115,the new compass is a feature on the non cellular se
116,how is a se for kid because it doe not have always on display wa everyone kid when they bought the series 3
117,800 dollar heck no
118,i have series 4 and i ordered the apple watch ultra using some of credit card point and i ended paying dollar850 canadian dollar around dollar650 usd which i saved almost dollar400 cad tax included apple watch ultra price in canada dollar1099 and with tax the total you end up paying dollar1263 the bad thing it is going to be delivered in november
119,dan r i just made another a test for battery using the wayfinder face switching it to dark mode only and it lasted 3 day without the need to use low power mode
120,you get it yet
121,it bother me that everyone keep saying ip6x when it is actually called ipx6 it concern me even more so that apple f ed that up in their material they published about the watch they ought to know better and should have better more knowledgeable editor to catch thing like that
122,bro watch ultra is only for user who use it for mountaineering diving and other extreme sport even triathlon we can not just buy it if we have money
123,best year to buy apple watch series 7 haha
124,you just know next year apple will have a smaller version of the ultra
125,and color hopefully
126,i would not suggest woman in the u to use the temp sensor mainly because there could be issue with the over throwing of roe v wade
127,i am getting the 45mm series 8 with gps my first smart watch period
128,dude i do not believe i will buy a dollar800 watch whata f apple
129,no they did not make the choice difficult se and series 8 come with very little change do not need those two option replacing my series 7 nike watch wa discontinued ultra is a purchase worth considering
130,s7 s8 apple watch ultra
131,ultra too expensive and watch 8 too little battery life if watch 8 had 36 hr battery life with full use i could get that
132,i am upgrading from the series 3 to series 8 lmao
133,i want it but it too big pause
134,can you guy test the accuracy of the new improved gps in the iphone 14 pro it is supposed to have better gps i do not think any other reviewer is gon na test it at all looking forward to all your in depth video especially the 13 pro v 14 pro camera test
135,i am a teenager and my parent are planning to get me an apple watch for my birthday i have only had one watch before this and looking at the spec i think se is best for me thanks for the vid
136,will the series 8 have the keyboard a the series 7
137,best bang for the buck because of the battery life hahaha what a joker
138,i have bought apple watch s8 waiting for it consignment that is an upgrade for me because there are two new sensor on it in comparison of s5
139,apple watch 7 v se 2022
140,49 mm v panarai 49 mm
141,ummmhuuu ijusten
142,lol i don really think much people will buy the ultra it is so damm expensive and there are many competition out like especially garmin which the battery life are measured in month
143,getting a 700 dollar cellular for your son bruh
144,my only complaint about the ultra is they most likely did not shrink the 7nm node process from the s6 to at least 5nm i know we do not need more performance but greater efficiency can not be overstated in how much it is wanted and the value it would add could probably easily have hit 48 hour or probably more had they shrunk the size of the s8 and left processing performance the same
145,apple usually underestimate it watch battery life so hitting 48 doe not sound too difficult for it plus energy saving mode is still available
146,and it is ugly and bulky
147,se m1 macbook air amazing value device series 8 m2 macbook air fr who the hell is this for ultra m1 pro 14 macbook pro not cheap but a highly capable great value device
148,this is more of an ultra review and comparison
149,i have had the series 4 for a while it work fine and all but i decided to get the 8 because it is already 4 series old but now i am thinking i should have got the 7 i skipped on the new iphone this year because i have the 13 pro max and plan on getting next year iphone i am also upgrading to the airpods pro since i am still using the 1st gen airpods
150,6 series thank you
151,it is easy do not buy any apple watch
152,if apple would let u samsung user pair the watch i would get an ultra
153,that ultra is fucking awesome
154,i am shocked shocked that apple ha not sent you guy the new iphones
155,do not forget apple watch 6 the only difference between 6 and 7 is a tiny bit of screen size
156,what is better the series 7 or se 2 i am looking to buy my first apple watch for fitness the se lack some of the feature i want like ekg but then it ha the newer tech inside can anyone help do not think i can afford a series 8 even though that would be the best option for me
157,ted anteby you will not be using ecg daily and let god make you use ecg very le be healthy
158,anshul shrivastava honestly i think i might just get the series 8 at xmas time by then i should have enough saved up and it seems like the best option all round se just seems a little outdated still great for kid but le for people who want to use it for health and fitness i plan on using all those health feature regularly
159,what do you mean ecg only for a few day
160,that ecg will be just for few day and afterwards there will be no use of that so please go for value for money and make a sensible decision
161,ultra taking the piss well done apple
162,nice great info
163,18 hour the galaxy watch 5 get 50 why can not apple improve the battery life
164,already got the ultra look dope
165,people fascination with high end nice packaging just kill me
166,i will keep my series 4 for this year
167,ultra wayyyy to big for me give me a slap wrist band watch asap
168,been wanting my apple watch to be like the ultra for a while when it wa announced it wa like they read my mind since i go hiking a lot
169,what is precise device tracking is that like find my iphone i want to know cuz i am thinking about going for the new se
170,i wish they did two size with ultra 45mm is a big a i can go with my wrist size
171,is the series 8 able to detect fever if it ha a temperature sensor able to detect 1 degree change it should be able to detect when someone is running a fever it would be cool if you guy could test that
172,andreas elia i think it is assumed you will be able to determine you have a fever since that is detected by body temperature and it doe show you body temperature maybe they can not legally say it can specifically fever because that range varies from person to person or occasion after exercising v cold shower i imagine a feminazi on menopause will usually hit 3 digit and get close to melting the temp sensor anyway i decided again to not buy it it is the closest i ever got to owning an apple watch it certainly ha attractive feature but i can not justify dollar500 tax for a watch i do not really need
173,even if it doe detect fever with low power mode coming to series 4 and later with the new o update and the crash detection on the new iphones a well it doe make way more sense to buy a series 7
174,shadow 133 i agree but why did not apple talk about this they mostly talked about ovulation i tried to google it and did not found any mention of it some say it would be a feature for future version of the watch i find this weird
175,i imagine that is the main purpose of that feature
176,i finally upgraded my series 5 and got lucky with a series 7 for 220dollar picked up locally it wa also sealed so i have been using it for a couple day and the bigger screen 2 day of battery life have been amazing
177,any update
178,thanks for this video i wa about to buy the se 2 but decided to stretch a bit and go with the 7 like you recommended i feel good about it
179,i have had my series 3 since 2018
180,i would if apple would introduce a new colour to the base series 8 in the future
181,it is priced at dollar800 which make it a killer value lol the se here is the best watch this year
182,not a hard choice at all every apple watch i have had ha been stainless steel and titanium my only regret is i did not get the ceramic so when the ultra came out at dollar799 it wa a no brainer the most difficult thing is waiting until the 23rd
183,i am having a hard time waiting i search youtube everyday now ahahha
184,no one should be buying the 8 stainless worst buy you can do
185,since the series 8 is a marginal upgrade i bought the series 7 for dollar100 off on amazon in the beautiful blue color
186,same
187,why did apple only come out with that color i think that is going to be down fall
188,so the ultra ha overkill feature for extreme sport without the battery life to go along bummer it seems it is gon na end up being a super premium watch for people willing to pay twice the price for another day of battery
189,i noticed the nike branded watch did not get updated with that woman thing and the crash feature the hermes monster price apple watch did get updated for people that want to spend between dollar1 000 and almost dollar2 000 for an apple watch
190,woman thing sigh
191,the ultra apple watch is the first apple product i am interested in year the iphones with the wouldynamic island however did not hit the g spot
192,what if they called it gynamic island
193,ok then you will not like the google oasis
194,i have never had an apple watch so i just bought the series 8 i just think the ultra is too big
195,i really want to get the ultra i go on hike but have really small whist sadly
196,doe ultra come with gorilla arm so that it will fit my new wrist
197,all these tech boy are going to be sitting in their ac office flexing the ultra on their tiny wrist
198,the ultra should of had a minimum of 64gb storage minimum
199,thank you for watching and commenting message right away i have got something for you
200,that ruby red band how cool it would be if it wa that ultra orange
201,when you guy get the new iphones please compare the 14 pro and 14 pro max thermal and performance cause some leaked benchmark point to a 17percent faster cpu while other to a barley faster one could it just be the a15 in the normal 14 that get barley above last year s phone i really need to know if their is any difference between the pro and pro max other than the battery and display size before getting one thanks
202,thank you for watching and commenting message right away i have got something for you
203,do you think it is worth it to go from the series 5 to the 8
204,in that case i would either go with the ultra new design or wait one year the aw5 is still a good watch the design of the aw8 is quite dated and i would not be surprised if the non ultra apple watch will get a refined design similar to the ultra with next year is update
205,which watch ha the medication tracker
206,all
207,apple watch series 8 stainless steel cost 220dollar more than the series7 europe price which one to buy
208,thank you for watching and commenting message right away i have got something for you
209,thanks for the video i just canceled my apple watch series 8 order and purchased the apple watch ultra
210,thank you for watching and commenting message right away i have got something for you
211,6 20 why exactly are you personally excited for the siren that seems like an odd thing to say what use case excites you about this feature are you often in situation where your cry for help go unheard do you just enjoy loud sound please explain
212,i think y all should wait till the product is in hand so we can get quality video
213,series 8 should be 36hrs and 60hrs with low energy mode and ultra 60hrs and 120hrs with low energy mode otherwise they can not be compatible with huawei watch
214,thank you for watching and commenting message right away i have got something for you
215,have a series 4 and should have gotten a 7 waited on the 8 to see if space gray would return will probably get a 7 on sale if possible a for juuk band i have had one for over three year and have received many compliment on it definitely recommend
216,i have the series 4 and i can not decide on if i want to upgrade se is never an option for me it is either s8 or ultra and can not decide on either i am waiting to see review and more hand on to get a better idea on each my wrist is about 165mm
217,i got both to see which i liked more wanted a 41mm for jogging realistically ultra is so clunky and unnatural feeling on the wrist and doe not offer a much a all these youtube reviewer act like it doe it doe feel like a big unnecessary toy to a degree like who want to exercise with a giant as watch anyways def just a stunt watch with a poorly positioned action button too easy to bump or accidentally press
218,i would say get the 8 or the 7 since it is probably gon na get discounted quite a bit for black friday and christmas the only reason people are getting the ultra is just to flex which is pretty fucking stupid
219,my brother doe not have an apple watch which one should he get
220,corey i think so i had a s7 with a 12 pro max but honestly the se is a modern apple watch that will satisfy the need of most die hard apple fan and if he doe not like it he can always use it to trade up for a s7 s8
221,kevin campbell that would fit right at home with the 12 pro max he ha
222,se
223,ultra is the new biggie small
224,dan rustle i guess you do not know the reference notorious b i g the rapper the very overweight rapper wa also known a biggie small
225,what
226,do not you think they will make more use of the temp sensor in future io update
227,i am surprised it doe not tell you if you got the c19 with the oxygen plus the temp you know
228,go with the se unless you got deep pocket and absolutely need always on
229,wa talking about this somewhere else but i wonder will s8 is body temperature sensor alert you when you are getting sick
230,jinx20001 ah i see thanks for the clarification
231,in theory yes of course it will but by the time your watch tell you that you are sick you will already be aware of it since even 1 2 degree in body temperature change can mean you are sick and you likely already know about it you wouldnt want the watch to indicate you are getting sick early since your body temperature can fluctuate a small amount anyway it would take some proper voodoo magic to let you know you are going to get sick before you actually are so that isnt going to happen
232,my first apple watch will be this new se
233,just got it last week i think it is a worth buy for a first watch
234,me too
235,series 8 series 7 woman edition
236,doe cellular watch support 5g esim when phone is not around pls opine
237,in europe the decision is clear apple watch 7 the price of the 8 ha increased so much that is become deterrent
238,i just picked up a brand new series 7 and saved gbp100 over a new series 8 it suck that apple proclaimed not to have increased price when in reality the rest of the world paid dearly for the usa only price freeze
239,exactly what i did refurbished 7 for 339 wa all set to get the 8 but that price rise for zero useful new feature nope
240,hustle acc absolutely there is no need to get the 8 at all
241,is not the only new thing on the series 8 the temperature sensor and car crash detection that is it i would rather spend 100 150euros le for the series 7
242,the se is by far the best value and choice for someone is first watch
243,so i ended up with an ultra very happy i did the battery life is worth it alone
244,at least for me
245,celtics20 i am getting the se
246,i wa originally going to get the ultra but for my first watch i may get a 45 mm 7 or the se i always have my phone with me so i do not need a cellular watch
247,kenneth jenkins my friend got it it is so cool
248,watch ultra the app for diving need a subscription the standard free version is only for snorkeling
249,ultra is great if you live in an earthquake zone since ultra can emit 86 decimal in case you stuck in rubble after earthquake
250,edward x winstonit ha a range of 180 metre i am sure dog will able to pick up if not human 180 metre is significan not what do u think
251,there you go 86 decimal but how will you use them to affect your rescue
252,massive 36 hour battery life bruh
253,lol i thought the same i can go an entire week on my fitbit 24 7 body health sleep monitoring without turning off any feature
254,how big is ijustines wrist though maybe 140mm max
255,sheldoncooper0 ijustine had an acting career check on internet
256,full metal i am 6 3 and she wa only a bit shorter than me when i met her did not take note of her wrist size though she is not an actress athelete so i am not sure where her height listing online would come from probably not accurate
257,sheldoncooper0 did quick search online and say she is 5 3 tall
258,i have brought this up many time given that people have been using her short video a a reference point on deciding what is overlooked is that justine could have massive wrist above male average which could indicate that the watch is even larger than what people had in their mind
259,short version if you are not looking to get pregnant get a series 7 on clearance sale now before it is too late and you have to pay extra for series 8
260,do the cellular model use the same modem a the iphone 14 is i am curious when apple switch to their own modem design if battery life will increase
261,no apple watch until it transmits heart rate to garmin edge device
262,so everybody else is releasing hand on video for new iphone you guy just still uploading these click bait video great job guy
263,i am going with the ultra the 2000 nit turn the apple watch from a toyish looking device to what i always wanted from the apple watch that is why i do not use an apple watch since 5 year so that is a great update
264,what doe the screen brightness have to do with it looking toyish or not lol it will likely have an ambient light sensor which mean it will only reach 2000nits in the very brightest outdoor condition you do not want that thing blaring at 2000 nit very often not only will the pretty poor battery life be even poorer but the oled display will take a beating aswell brightness and oled is do not go well they degrade faster the brighter they go
265,so basically if you have a first gen se there is zero reason to upgrade to the se 2 in fact i would argue the build material are worse
266,juan tamad plastic underside
267,why are the build material worse
268,discounted s7 is the only correct answer
269,will the temp sensor work only for ovulation any chance to track other issue later that is my doubt to upgrade to s8 instead of s7 from my s3
270,my guess is that there will be other us for it in the future with software update regardless it will still track your temperature over night even if you are a male i imagine they will use the sensor in conjunction with other sensor such a giving you a better indication if you are getting sick my 2 cent is if you are planning on keeping the same watch for 5 year before upgrading then go with the 8 if you are someone who is going to upgrade in 2 3 year then get the 7
271,only apple know such a waste of a sensor if it is only for ovulation and sleep tracking though
272,i like the extra battery and brightness of ultra i like feel and look of stainless steel so confused
273,please get a samsung and be happy pathetic battery life is a no brainer
274,please keep in mind that the price in the eu will be more expensive this year then u counterpart
275,you can blame their constituent
276,doe series 7 hve u1 chip
277,informative video with great in depth coverage of all feature will help prospective customer make an informed decision
278,once i am finished paying off my apple watch 7 i will be upgrading to the ultra
279,stop do not make a mistake wait careful wrong god these title are so freaking annoying
280,many of u are comfortable with android phone to buy an iphone just to use an apple watch may not be practical i wish if apple allowed u to pair the apple watch with an ipad it would be the best of both world
281,thanks for your content
282,that ultra watch look so good
283,being a series 7 user i guess i will skip the series 8 tell me if i am wrong
284,not wrong at all the series 8 is a minimal upgrade could not even up the battery life from an abysmal 18 hour
285,agree
286,on top of that amp not only that
287,my s4 watch broke 2 year ago have not had a watch in a while may get the ultra
288,i have the s4 s6 and s7 s8 look like a minimal upgrade i would go for the ultra but since i am not an extreme sport athlete so probably will upgrade my air pod pro instead
289,what is the point of a cellular model if you have an iphone too guess i am kinda a noob here
290,scott murphy you would still have to pair it with an iphone just that you do not need to carry the iphone with you
291,brane uw so basically you can use it if it is not paired to your iphone
292,exactly i mean i do not use celluar model on first gen se since carry my phone a lot
293,you can go for a run without your phone and still be able to make a call for example
294,i went with the apple watch ultra mainly for the size i have a pretty large mechanical watch collection and since i started using the apple watch series 5 it is always felt small
295,chrisrules plenty of woman use the watch it really only matter if you have a small wrist not all woman are small ffs
296,this may sound a bit rude but the ultra is too big for woman and look more masculine
297,django groen one could say that about any smartwatch including apple compared to a traditional mechanical watch if look are a priority
298,i agree being unisex design the regular apple watch always seemed thin and small
299,django groen something being considered ugly and expensive are both depending on the person i do not think it is ugly or expensive i am not saying it is the best looking apple watch but it is not horrible
300,just buy last year apple watch series 7 skip the series 8
301,lt1 2 i did the same
302,that is what i did saved a nice dollar70
303,yea that is what i am gon na do
304,hi zero hour gang
305,i will be keeping my 7 and wait till they do something better a i do not need nor want the ultra
306,doe de apple watch ultra will be compatible with the magsafe duo charger
307,yes
308,i am glad i got the se 1 the se 2 doe not seem to be much faster and the back is plastic now which i am not a huge fan of i prefer the ceramic i would love a titanium apple watch but the ultra is a bit expensive and bulky for me
309,based i do not see it a a major downgrade it is just not for me and it doe come with a price reduction
310,the se 2 is like major downgrade from the se 1 the new apple line up is quite disappointed tbh same chip a the iphone 13 pro max on iphone 14 line up and se 2 with plastic back
311,i have the series 5 and i feel like the current se would be fine for me i do not use the always on display
312,i wonder if apple will skip the 9 next year and go straight to the 10 like the iphone together with watchos10 will we see a watch x
313,shangram mohammad good we need a new redesign i will stick with my series 3 til then
314,they skipped the 9 because of apple is 10 year anniversary which is what the iphone x wa all about something similar might happen with the 10 year anniversary of the apple watch my best guess would be a total redesign of the current apple watch series
315,you have hit the nail on the head too often reviewer are comparing the ultra to past smart watch where a it fitting a true watch or sport watch genus i ware a breitling and now just purchased the ultra it is lighter and no different in size so it is perfect i really do not get the size criticism
316,send it in we can color it any color u want with engraving
317,gor this for my birthday coming from a series 3 watch this is a huge step up
318,informative ad
319,the cost of the ultra in europe 983 55 dollar ridiculous
320,wooo where can i find this cute bonzai sakura in the background
321,each of these expensive device
322,dope editing
323,this video had me upgrade from the series 3 to the ultra i have been influenced
324,yeah the silver watch color stand out would buy it if it came out with a different watch case color like black
325,do you think apple ultra will come out with a different watch color case
326,if i have series 8 is it worth the change
327,you communicate really well thanks for the info i am waiting for my apple watch ultra to be delivered and you helped me learn the new feature
328,if they can add apple fitness video on the watch that would be well worth the difference in my opinion
329,everytime marque say but one demon soul ha been killed
330,yeah my cousin got in a paramotoring accident and he had this watch and the siren saved his life for people on the road to here he had crashed
331,doe it come in black batman
332,i will be honest i went with the ultra because i wanted a bigger watch that i did not have to charge every night other than that idk if i will ever use the other feature
333,14 04 if you are worried about your wrist size do not sweat it i have been self conscious about my wrist my entire life because they are pretty damn thin but the apple watch ultra really doe not look that big even on my wrist
334,i am bothered that you wear it on your right arm lol
335,i had 100percent on monday morning on thursday night i wa at 15percent
336,bruh the gbp600 accessory for your gbp800 phone
337,just bought this big as watch for no reason i love it btw it is huge and the battery is great you can definitely suffice with the series 8 for way le money but again i love it only thing i do not like is that the silver screen is very annoying i think the black would be a better option
338,i got a black case from amazon that look decent definitely would have preferred it came in black tho
339,it could not fit my small hand look too big even for you
340,in case you did not hear he doe ultimate frisbee
341,bruh the battery thing is just stupid my 100 dollar oppo watch free last a full 4 night till the 5th day with extensive training sleep monitoring etc so that is another apple style yesterday is tech at tomorrow is price
342,i love the design of this watch it look stylish and stunning
343,great review in describing the pro and con when it come to the extra feature the apple watch ultra provides well done
344,is it possible to select a sound for the alarm app or doe it only vibrate
345,i never owned an apple watch until i saw the ultra i wa waiting for something special to put on my wrist and i guess this is it i will be testing it soon on scafell pike mountain in england why is it so expensive in the uk it is gbp850 dollar1050
346,12 17 i will link the episode specifically below the like button so you can listen to it
347,bro i bought one and the back cracked about a month in unfortunately i did not get the apple care since i wa coming from a series 2 and that one look new sad
348,late to the party but i wa browsing watch today a after i did the update to 16 4 on my 14 pro max the watch gave up the ghost again get stuck in boot loop last august i had bb geek squad look at it they could not fix it sold me a refurb for dollar400 now 6 month later this one is not working gon na contact them for option but i have a hunch i know where it is heading i always get stainless case large screened watch because i have big wrist and they look more proportional plus i like the weight a series 8 in stainless 45mm is the same price a an ultra so i thought about it came to see your thought thanks for the video and honest review i think it is a no brainer that if they are both the same price to just get the ultra but i am still undecided do not use have the stuff my regular one do so it might be overkill but at the same price a a s8 45mm
349,2k calorie burning that is a real flex right there
350,just realized that you through in the john mayer g shock in there nice
351,if they could just make the standard apple watch model the same size a this i would get it standard apple watch is too small this watch at it size with a titanium band is absolutely beautiful and look like a proper watch on the wrist ill wait for the price to drop on this
352,i have the samsung galaxy watch 5 and it last me easily 3 5 day depending on usage
353,i really do not get why apple are not using solar energy seiko use it
354,because they have not perfected it yet they are always late to the game with thing but it end working better than their competitor
355,apple sheep lol
356,ah finally something that might withstand the army
357,i think it all dependes whether you need it or not im not a pro athlete just a runner and i only need to know simple thing like distanced run timer calorie burned and some simple item and i have the apple watch se which is good enough for me however if u are a pro athlete hiker scuba diver hardcore adventurer i think it might worth buying it but still considering it an 800 dollar watch if you are willing to pay then it fine but for me it all just depends on whether u need it or not
358,can we appreciate that catch tho 13 00
359,great video however scuba diver be aware there is a bit of a mix up with the info this watch doe not feature air integration which is the same thing a tank pressure monitoring perhaps in the future apple will make an ultra capable of emitting a radio signal that work underwater compatible with existing tank cylinder transmitter now that would be awesome
360,the extended battery is one of the few thing that i actually like about this device it is overrated and overpriced the hand washing feature doe not work most of the time i want a smaller watch with a better battery and blood glucose monitoring
361,the price difference is not that much differnet from the apple watch 8 stainless steel so i would say the ultra is a better choice
362,once i found out that this watch could go underwater and while scuba diving give you your decompression time i wa in
363,i had a pro trek watch that wa a breast
364,i think you are missing part of your steering wheel
365,excellent review i have been a google pixel fan boy for many year but i absolutely love this watch i do not have the biggest wrist and i am not a big fan of io but this watch ha me thinking
366,however the design the fact that i am forced to use an iphone to use this watch and i love my solar garmin hard to think 2 day of battery a good when my solar garmin fenix 7 sapphire for about the sa e price last month or so ha one app that cover all and phone not limited can even pair to an iphone also it is basically ugly
367,try a garmin fenix 7 solar i would l9ve to hear you review that and it is definitely available in a nice dark gunmetal
368,800 dollar garmin much better investment
369,still not solar like my year old fenix 7 sapphire solar which need charge once a month or so touchscreen etc plus it is round round
370,when i bought the watch i thought it will have a real always on and bright screen but it still dims like any other apple watch
371,nice
372,dollar800 apple see you sucker coming from 1000 mile away hahahahaha hahahahaha
373,great tutorial however800 dollardollardollar fir what i can get for about 165 dollardollar by buying the amazfit gts 4 same feature and battery life is phenomenal i can charge to 100percent and leave on for about 6 day w o charging for the money and battery life i went with the amazfit gts 4
374,dam apple is saving the environment and reducing pakacage waste by making their product unaffordable
375,in india we pay 1050dollar for apple watch ultra
376,is apple car play can by use with the watch without the iphone
377,no you still need iphone to connect to car for music or anything or apple car play
378,look cool full size for man
379,pretty shocked at how easy it wa to chip my series 7 accidentally smacked it into a barbel
380,i know this is an older video and you probably will not see this but i just realized that your left handed like me yet you have not set your watch up this way this would fix the issue of you pressing the action button on accident
381,8 11 huh i could have told them the reason had they asked the consumer instead of assuming it is the price not some missing monitoring feature
382,i am not a fan of smartwatches i am a fan of regular watch with several feature
383,ur hair to nappy bruh for me to watch ur vids i do not like messy hair do not care what ethnicity someone is just a pet peeve
384,can not wait to facetime on apple watch
385,ultra suit is way more than pro pro with apple is not really that the macbook pro is so much le than which i would confided pro saying that i have one and i am a total apple fan girl looking forward to getting the ultra
386,seems to be the ideal technology to have especially all of those californian stuck in the snow for week and can be located via satellite
387,naaah
388,thank you for the review very interesting
389,13 06 this look like the frisbee version of american football
390,the watch would have to somehow connect to your air tank to read air pressure there is no way to accurately measure air consumption by timing it
391,seems pretty cool but i still live in the area where a mechanical watch is my favorite
392,doe it work without the phone
393,yes
394,i still have a series 4 and i swear it always dy in like 3 hour with light use lol
395,fw the honest review
396,the only weakest point is the battery 36 h is not enough they can do better this watch can save life is god forbid example lost in a forest stuck in building during earthquake emergency 911 whatever reason it can do a lot lot thing but battery my be the reason
397,garmin venu 2 plus is six day i wish they could do more
398,best analisys i ever saw awesome thaanks
399,can it measure blood glucose or still not available
400,i know this review is about the watch but damn boy what have you done with your hand with all those scar thats a story i would like to know
401,my guy wore a watch with a tux
402,this watch is for people that hike and dive and adventure me being 6 6 and fat ooooh it is got a big as screen
403,do you wear in on the right or left wrist or just switch based on the time of the day band
404,can you please tell me what i will not have with no cellular only call and the option not have my phone with me i ask cause i might buy an apple watch ultra from usa to use it in europe
405,i have not heard of this watch before when i first saw one the other day i thought it wa a apple watch in some sort of aftermarket case anyway it is too big fugly and expensive for that money i would get a garmin epix gen 2
406,nah
407,bro the apple commercial made it look like the battery would last for a month only 2 day
408,this guy throw frisbee a a sport your a 16 yo white kid who did an experiment and got locked in a black nig rian man body hahah no but foreal great content top feedback about the product
409,it is not worthy for diver if it can not monitor tank pressure
410,how long to fully charge the ultra
411,a a non water person or traveler i need this for it multi day battery only it is annoying charging every night i forget to strap it on often lol and the screen is bigger
412,when the battery last two week i will think about it
413,15 minute of talking about a watch that will cost you a fortune and doe the same a my aw 5 dollar 1 000 for a smartphone on your wrist really
414,now apple borrowing word from samsung
415,the best tech reviewer all the content is fire
416,unless the watch ha solar charge and a blowjob from jesus dollar800 is too much
417,i have one and i absolutely love it best purchase i have made in a while
418,a for the battery life i have a charging station at the side of my bed wireless charging for my phone watch amp airpods every night
419,the bluetooth connection work with older car i have a 2009 bmw and it pair and work syk
420,best review ever
421,nice video pal but do not you think it ha some comfort issue with this orange loop i mean is this practically comfortable
422,may i know how what watch face are you using
423,dope intro a always
424,why do you switch the wrist it is on throughout the day
425,the review and the visuals to go along with them are always awesome appreciate marque and the team
426,the battery life on these are absolutely amazing for an apple product even if you are not an extreme athlete it is still great to have for just busy body always on the move
427,i love large watch too
428,love the battery but i still want more battery life a whole week worth of battery and it should still only take a hour to charge good luck apple
429,a a hunter that hike a lot the way point feature is very attractive
430,i just bought one a couple day ago and i love it i am not a diver or climber or anything like that so most of the feature do not really apply to me but i love how big it is and it actually make me want to get out and run exercise when the weather get a bit warmer i will definitely be using the watch to more of it capability
431,i compared the weight of the 61 gram ultra to my 39 gram 45mm series 8 and wa surprised that i barely noticed the extra weight and fyi the silver titanium of the ultra is closest to the starlight aluminum of the series 8 not the silver i really like the look of titanium although the nike sport loop band paired with the s8 make for a nice tight fit i am a pianist and need the watch to stay snug without throwing off my wrist is balance i am seriously considering taking it back and getting the ultra there is nothing wrong with the 45mm s8 but the upgraded feature are great for me tough call if the weight had been obviously noticeable i would not be considering this
432,it is worth it great device
433,2 full day
434,the pro is for the people who can afford it i had a friend with a iphone 13 pro he didnt know u can switch betwen apps by swiping left and right on the bottom of the phone
435,6 33 from my first day of using apple watch i set the display to list view style
436,i really wan to know how good it doe with dust and water combo
437,elderly like my mom that need larger and brighter screen not tech savvy need battery life and need the safety feature like fall alert sound extreme but service that do fall alert usually charge like dollar50 a month which make apple watch ultra all the sudden sound reasonable dollar10 a month for cell service and watch pay for itself versus cost of fall alert service within a year plus provides her a lot accessibility feature than just fall alert
438,you can watch video on it now sold
439,so if you decide to go someweare in nature or mountain or lake you can not without power bank and price it to funny it worth maybe 300 400dollar not 800 there is so much better batery friendly watch for le money shame on you apple
440,apple ha made their clientele sheep
441,garmin ha been doing this and so much more for a long time
442,marque could you tell me what pen you are using in this video thanks
443,and i am watching this from my 5 dollar aliexpress chair and my apple watch series 3 from walmart i love watching video about thing i can not afford
444,he said jack u want me to show u a magic trick u will never 4 get pull down ur pant and close ur eye see same same but different but still same same no u own me a gold medal now fly
445,you could not break apple incryption with arch and razor with a martini saber with a thermal lanc with a quantum computer frozen to keven o my coach avondale mandating told me that the athlete are so fast that the heart is the weakest point in the machine
446,would be great if smartwatches could charge itself due to a small solar panel thing in the screen
447,thanks for the review you have just convinced me to get on if i get some good news soon
448,big is better
449,hey mate not your best review i get it you wan na a black and slick watch get a garmin epix
450,this a hole ha 1000 word when 5 would do he is paid for every review
451,worst smart watch on the market fact smart watch pro 5 your get 6 day looool
452,very impressed woth the battery took it off it is charger on thursday morning used it a normal did not ever engage low power mode sunday morning still on 15percent not bad
453,i always get the feeling that the fancy schmancy graphic and editing turn these vids into ad
454,this watch is pretty silly
455,it is worth every single penny i have yet to see anyone actually try this on their wrist and then return it it is an amazing watch anyone talking trash on it ha either never touched one it is too big for their wrist or they hate apple
456,one of the best product i have ever purchased
457,i like what you have been doing video presentation you are zeroing in the important question and making it easier for the viewer to make a choice relevant to their personal situation and need thank you
458,great and detailed review much appreciated thank you for taking the time to make it
459,i am a normal user and i got the ultra
460,hell no
461,i have a realme watch s severely limited feature ha a 390 mah battery but last like 15 20 day cost around dollar100 so like what is actually eating the battery on those guy doe accuracy in health monitoring and gps really eat up that much battery
462,i guess apple people are easily amazed i am not sure what you all are putting into your kool aid but i have absolutely no idea how you all can tolerate the insanely poor battery performance of the aw lineup i get 3 week of continuous use from my garmin fenix before i need to charge it i really want to like the awu but the price and laughable lack of battery performance is a deal breaker for me
463,samsung frontier is black and work very well with being a rugged watch
464,i will wait when it becomes solar powered
465,13 07 that wa awesome
466,apple watch in general pollute the environment after 5 year of use are for replacement so buy a real watch especially if you gon na spend 1000 euro for a watch and buy one that will hold for a lifetime
467,way too big
468,the one deal breaker for me is the square body
469,it is apple is sapphire crystal low quality sapphire lmfao been using it on iphones camera lens for year
470,0 05 5 second in and i am already hitting the dislike button only nerd play ultimate frisbee
471,doe it take a sim card are there any slip on wristband not belt one
472,unboxing therapy ha a really good video about this using only it for a day the round watch are tapering the wrong way
473,definitely overkill for me for what i do but the size and battery life make it the winner
474,i have hesitated to buy an apple watch mainly because of how frequently the prior version need to be charged what is the point of sleep tracking if i have to charge the phone while i am sleeping because it is dead or dying from day use this seems to fix that issue i feel like this watch is meant to compete with the garmin fenix good looking watch the way finder is great so long a you are not lost in the middle of know where for more than two day i have a simple fitbit inspire 2 hr that track my workout sleep hr and i charge it every two week work for me
475,it is not a pro tool
476,you left out the another huge group of people the people who just want to have the latest and greatest

480,i purchased an apple watch series 8 45 mm version on december 31 2022 today is january 25 2023 and yesterday on january 24 2023 i have never regretted a purchase in le than a month in my life until now of course i decided to purchase the apple watch ultra i sorely regret buying the apple watch series 8 i loved the fact that it wa 45 mm however the fact that the ultra just made this thing look so outdated that i literally now have spent dollar1200 almost for a freaking watch the sad thing is i have zero regret about it the apple watch ultra last for three day my apple watch series 8 lasted a day and a quarter and it be time to charge but not nearly dead so i think i could get about a day and a night in about another half of a day going into the night without it dying completely i do not have those worry north thought with my apple watch ultra i know i am gon na get a saw it 3 1 2 day but i know somewhere in there i will throw it on the charger for 20 or 30 minute or so so it will never truly ever have to die so to be honest all those extra feature do not mean shit because i do not use them anyway i am more concerned with the heart and health feature along with the workout element in the mindfulness feature i could give a flying fuck about diving i just want this thing to last i got my goddamn wish all praise to the lord chuck norris

487,my two cent coming in a little bit late lol the apple watch in my opinion look way better in the larger version the apple watch ultra i have always felt that the previous version looked a little cheap even though i have worn the apple watch seven with this being said to me the battery is better the look is absolutely much better and at least if you are wearing a nicer band it actually get a lot of compliment i would like to see this watch another 4 mm bigger would be perfect
488,will not need to buy a diving computer watch
489,2 day and 2 night and having 2o percent of battery left pff dude that is lame i use my huawei for 24 7 and then i need to change it and watch it is almost 3 year old and it is way more cheaper then this new apple ultra

496,the only thing it not timeless like an actual watch this thing will be out the door in 5 year when they stop signing it apple watch 3 sept 2017 released do yourself a favour get any swiss automatic and youll appreciate it your whole life
497,a great mini ipad lump upon the wrist reminds me of the very early casio calculator watch
498,a a travel photographer that go to extreme place this wa a must for me i swim with shark free diving am on my way to hike to photograph silverback gorilla in rwanda after which i will be in the desert of egypt and then am heading to antarctica to photograph whale that is a normal routine for me i do not take my phone on these excursion because the risk of losing dropping or breaking them is pretty high a well a an animal grabbing it which monkey or lemur will do so i purchased the cellular ultra but i understand most people are not doing these thing so i think it may be unnecessary for them i had a fitbit but this watch obviously doe more my fitbit battery last way longer i had the apple store make sure my screen stay off which they said will give me a few more day of battery life
499,how is the accuracy of calorie burned
500,i would only get this for the screen size and battery alone i currently have the se2
501,so i bought 2 watch ultra cellular 4 day ago and very disappointed i am getting a call fail if someone call me and both phone and watch are close by then i walk away leaving the phone away and talking on the watch after reaching some distance when the phone and watch get disconnected from bluetooth i am getting a call fail until the watch start using his data apple and my carrier att telling me watch should not be working like that but no one give me a solution i am returning both watch next week if no one resolve this problem apparently happening to everyone just not all people are aware about this issue any tip or help thanks
502,i would love to see you in that tux sporting the watch doe the ultra watch have a simple clock face love your engaging video
503,1100 cdn
504,i am on the fence right now the big selling point for me is the case and the safire crystal i have never had an apple watch and am looking at getting one for sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring i wa gon na go with the series 8 but if you compare the lte version the ultra is only 50 dollar more and you get so much extra with it
505,if it is really only 50dollar more for you get the ultra it is sick
506,ultimate frisbee player thats a sport now lol
507,can not wait to test mine out snowboarding see how well it track speed and distance over my slope app
508,nice
509,if u arent a pro at something or a really rich watch collector just do not buy this watch llol
510,so hey i am not an athlete at all or anything even close to it but i do love these apple watch i do a let of text while working and have found the apple watch a good way to make that faster instead of taking your phone out unlocking it opening message etc so for someone like me out of all the apple watch out there which do you think would be the best i like this ultra with the longer battery life but do not know if i really need all those extra feature that i will probably never use thanks bud vinnie from alaska
511,my first apple watch and i went for this ultra watch im not a hiker or a swimmer but i just had to get it for it size and i have a small wrist i love it
512,what i think every review missed on the ultra is the price v normal apple watch stainless price it is the same price with so much more
513,i got a apple watch from aliexpress gbp27 ok not the same o a ultra but doe everything else make call sm heart rate etc the mark up on the ultra is obscene for what it is
514,most aliexpress watch have fake heart rate sensor and are not a good build quality wise
515,hmm
516,left wrist lol heart is further away from right wrist that is like having your thermostat at the complete opposite end of your house underwater depth then put it on your foot who care
517,i love your voice and your falcon heavy t shirt
518,garmin is laughing at this battery life lol if you are going to spend 800 dollar on a watch get a real watch
519,real watch can not text call can not change the watch face can not measure heart rate etc etc
520,8 41 my dive computer ha no monthly subscription oceanic doe 8 58 air integration is tank pressure monitoring and you do not get it from apple watch and i am not a super extreme technical diver and use it all the time
521,i really thought the apple watch wa unnecessary at first but now after owning one i realized it is actually an extremely helpful and practical tool
522,great review i really appreciate how in depth you have gone it helped me to feel confident in my purchase decision thank you
523,personally price is not crazy since i am already in the garmin universe i just can not justify this one because lack of cycling power meter support which is a huge l and the battery life can not compare to a garmin either you do not need apple watch functionality or want it tbh when backpacking 5 day i am really glad apple entered this space though garmin ha not had great competition and ha been getting by with sub standard software for far too long
524,i am a doctor and using this watch so give me a like
525,i wish they would just ruggedize the normal watch
526,just got the se and i am loving it but one thing i wish if for bigger battery btw my se going for 2 day without a charge ik it say 18 hour but nope i had it on my wrist for 2 day straight and 1 2 night
527,what brand is the solid no hole sport band you have on in part of the video thanks for the great content
528,very good review i upgraded to the ultra from a 6 for the dive computer we went on 9 dive with the oceanic app you have to pay for the extra feature of the app but it is very cool it uploads everything to your phone you can also add note like visibility and marine life so you would not even need a log book anymore i think 100percent worth it for diver
529,yeah i bought it for the same reason and absolutely love it perfect for diving just do not make the mistake of diving with it in snorkelling mode a it lock you out of the dive mode for 24 hour
530,this is the comment i am looking for thanks i dive 10 15 time a year i think the dive computer make it worth it by itself
531,it is funny cause i have see more average user buy the ultra compared to the crowd that it is directed to maybe it is time apple update the apple watch design
532,no youtube no google it is very behind and do not recommend
533,samsung phone ultra samsung watch pro apple phone pro apple watch ultra
534,i am goin g to go buy one today
535,is it overkill for regular apple watch user but underperform for adventure watch
536,you will never use 90percent of apple watch feature and application i switched to garmin fenix solar titanium they show time they measure my health just like apple or better and yes they last for almost a month
537,it rubbish and a toy till it ha 10 day battery do not make these hype pl
538,have my dad my new green series 7 bought an ultra have not looked back it is like comparing a lexus to a porsche
539,dollar800 it is dollar1100 in europe
540,i just fot it cause it looked cool
541,yet another in a long line of fantastic video i honestly do not think i buy anything before checking your channel first lee em coming oh and dope catch
542,quit wearing stupid sport watch in sport where you can hurt people with unnecessary jewellery if people want to monitor their heart rate in a contact sport buy a chest strap if peep can not afford a chest strap then maybe they should not be paying their apple watch in instalment what happened to the common sense of not wearing ring watch is and other jewellery that can harm other people rant over
543,still not worth dollar800 going to continue to pas until there a need for this gimmick
544,the sapphire display on the apple watch ultra is not pure sapphire meaning it still scratch where regular gorilla glass would apple should not be claiming that it ha a sapphire display because of this
545,i got it cuz of trauma i wanted to make myself feel pretty
546,apple gone crazy with their product price an 800dollar for a watch that is robbery
547,worth it no
548,for 800usd there are many real watch for sale that will not be obsolete and useless after a couple of year
549,wa planning to buy this one but thankfully mkbhd ha a review on it and i decided not to go for it since i thought about i only do light work out and shoot some hoop on my local park yeah my apple watch se 2nd gen is fine with me save me so much money too lol
550,honestly the battery life is the sole reason i have never owned a smart watch regular watch last year and year
551,i have a question can you download like you tube and asphalt and other apps
552,still nowhere near a garmin
553,would this watch be good for blue collar people i do not want the regular watch because it seems breakable but this one seems a little bulky but reliable
554,it will be overkill for most normal people if you are an athlete or adventurer eg mountain climbing then yes this watch is for you and worth spending extra
555,but pro incline that if you are not a professional you might a well do with one of the lesser one or that it is used by professional ultra defines it is the best without having to doubt if you have to be a professional or use it for professional use p
556,is nobody going to comment on the fact that he go from black to white repeatedly
557,you wear your watch on the right hand i am surprised you did not use it in inverted mode so the crown wa on the left and easier to access
558,i just like looking cool amp important amp i got deep pocket u sold me on titanium silver one now i just need a pink band or awesome video type 2 diabetic hope this help me in gym
559,this watch ha made such an impact in me that i have actually decided to change to apple from samsung girlfriend pro hmmmmmm
560,what i got out of this review you burned 2k calorie in one sitting
561,haha the reason i do not use it the price
562,5 51 is this a sponsored video
563,finally ha a samsung battery but i am not paying 800 for just a samsung battery
564,cool watch but for me it is a bit much
565,i say to all this technology that the government is tracking everything and with a flip on a switch it will control everything
566,for autistic and adhd folk the durability and battery life is much more appealing than the standard series watch considering the amount of problem with screen popping out and damage to the case
567,the problem of the awu is that those small group of people at which the ultra pretend to aim at the one that do a lot high performance sport have better alternative than the ultra like the garmin epix for example which is more expensive i got ta say but at the same time a more complete option for swimmer cyclist climber diver etc so the ultra may not be even satisfying that small group of user i think the awu is pointless
568,excellent review
569,i much prefer the name ultra for a lot of these consumer product there is nothing professional about a pair of bluetooth earbuds or headphone
570,800 dollar in the netherlands is 1000 euro
571,where are the time stamp
572,love you marque
573,a an astronaut the ultra ha come very handy specially to keep me anchored to mar surface it ha some weight to it i am not bouncing all over like you see on tv i plan to wear it on my next trip to pluto i will let you guy know how the cellular data doe i am going to leave my cellphone here on earth and see if the cellular on my ultra still work to place phone call
574,the health app will that read your current step step count asymmetry floor climbed etc similar to the iphone if you are just using watch stand alone for time reading and tracking health what is estimated time that the i watch will last before it run out of the charge what are the standard background running apps on the watch that are fixed thaks
575,slept with 69 per cent battery hmmmm okay
576,plz review mi watch 7 pro specially
577,bro had the stickman display explanation backwards
578,whata is that look like small hand i want
579,phone in your hand
580,be a man wear your watch on the left hand
581,airpods suck compared to beat fit pro is unless you care too much about wireless charging
582,youtube overdosing on apple and ev
583,i bought a dollar25 fake one thats is perfectly fine for what i use these watch for and it last 2 week
584,this guy gon na make me waste 850dollar
585,nah piece of ugly crap
586,apple sounding more and more like a cult
587,what is working out to have spent 2 000 calorie lol
588,whoa re you wearing it on your wrist like that above the bone
589,a a regular joe who just doe weight 5 day a week and use my phone a a watch i do not need one thanks
590,just get a black case if you want it in black
591,about same price a iphone yup
592,if your wrist are big enough i guess that is a no for me then haha i have pianist hand bony like jack skelington and skinny wrist i once looked up if there wa a way to get more meaty hand and wrist
593,thanks for the great review a always very detailed and hit the point especially on battery life such a nice upgrade to the normal apple watch that are dead every day with moderate daily exercise
594,really enjoyed your review
595,i find it hard to believe that someone buying a watch for the purpose of running an ultra marathon would choose this over a garmin coros or polar
596,my daily driver is my garmin marq athlete and it is way smaller than this thing
597,imho no matter what apple doe to the watch to beef it up it doe not come close to garmin fenix 7x sapphire solar
598,no offence but why do american drive every where
599,the thing i do not like about apple watch is that every apple update it mess up all my alarm and schedule frustrating missing alarm and appointment
600,some of u are just fed up with being tracked listened to spied on alerted followed monitored etc i dumped my apple watch 2 year ago and my current iphone will be the last tech ha become intrusive
601,drootb you are welcome mr steroid
602,ok cuck
603,are you not taking it off to charge after a 3 hour practice for a shower
604,i saw a video of someone pairing the button to unlock lock his tesla pretty cool
605,omg that intro nailed it wow
606,right hand why are you a woman
607,what a rubbish piece of tech anyone who buy this need a checkup at the doctor
608,that catch
609,always with excellent review thanks
610,i just bought mine today and i just bought it for the look i probably will not ever use the feature but i love how big it is and how tough it is and they alpine band is nice
611,why thanks for watching out for my finance
612,that is why your broke
613,same here
614,wow what is that keyboard and keycaps at 2 43 i totally want these they look so cool anybody know
615,yep 2 day i can charge on day one around 8am and run it that day the evening full day another evening and charge the following morning you could say 3 day however it is clearly a two full day watch battery two and a bit if you let it run down below 20percent
616,hahahahahaha he drive a tesla hahahahahahahaah
617,rugged watch are definitely my style so i definitely do not mind wasting that much money for it
618,why do not you say 2 day of battery instead 2 day 2 night
619,this is the first smart watch that ha gotten my attention i do wear a number of automatic watch and i am a big g shock fan a well all of which i own are solar both of these do not rely on replacing battery and that is something that stick out for a number of watch people unfortunately i think the only two thing that will keep me from buying it is that i can not get a bluetooth wifi only model and it is still largely a novelty because my career doe not allow me to use it while working it is very cool though i just can not see paying for cellular service for a watch and there would never be a time that i could be wearing this watch that i do not also have my iphone on me
620,i have it and do not have a cellular plan for it work the exact same way i just need my phone with my for wifi stuff
621,just pay the watch in full and you do not have to have a cellular plan on it
622,i felt the same way a you but i got one a week ago and am beyond happy it is my first smart watch and i am already a huge fan
623,i appreciate that you wear your watch on your right wrist
624,i would rather spend dollar800 on a nice watch
625,that is objectively speaking very dumb
626,or work a whole lot you forgot u
627,who care why it is the best one from apple always buy the best
628,even employee with impressive salary did not buy it so why should i buy it it is unreasonably expensive for what is offer and many people understand that
629,apple just stopped pairing the series3 with the phone without even notifying the customer so i paid a 500 on a watch and someone just decided they do not want me to use it anymore that is outrageous i will not buy another one
630,the series 3 work fine with any iphone 6 or better
631,this is a paid review you will understand it when you watch all review by sport and health watch reviewer
632,my series 4 watch battery dy pretty quick now if i do not charge it one night it is pretty much dead the next day which it suck whenever i go camping for the weekend i have to bring my charger for it a well plus the bigger screen definitely look nice
633,that 3 day battery is good for apple appalling for garmin
634,dominick west garmin watch are better fitness watch and have longer battery life the apple watch is better at everything else
635,apple doe more though personally i still do prefer garmin nevertheless
636,ye but it is ugly
637,if your right handed why is not your watch on the left hand
638,nah no smart watch is worth that much i do not give a fuck what it can do dollar is not a problem for you dumb ass who will say bc i can not afford it
639,ronnie s my point dumb as 1
640,you can not afford it
641,get a hamilton khaki king for half
642,huawei watch last for more than a week with sleep tracking on
643,what a stupid fucking question none of apple is product are worth it
644,if you want a series adventure watch just get a garmin a 2 day battery life on a watch like this is simply not good enough
645,marque to his in law one day so i have been married to your daughter for about a week now here is my review
646,i sold this watch and bought omega who need this watch which will be obsolete in 5 year omega will be valuable for hundred of year
647,all this smart tech is rubbish you will want to replace it with a newer model in 2 year and you will have to replace it in 5 year because it will be so out of date and the battery capacity non existent i bought a casio protrek solar powered watch 20 year ago and still work perfect these watch are designed to be dumped and replaced in a short time that is how apple and other similar manufacturer make money
648,to me it is le of a watch more of a wearable phone
649,but can you use it without paring it to the iphone
650,it is not named pro because it is not the pro since there is already an orthodox and flagship version of apple watch no le pricy apple watch stainless steel
651,non apple watch wearing master scuba diver thought marque stickman example is correct i am a long time apple fan but have never purchased an apple watch because it simply doe not have the feature that i want i fit into that fringe group and have been waiting for an upgraded version that could stick with the activity i like to do their dive computer is impressive but keep in mind it is only functional for recreational diver with a max depth of 130ft any technical diver going beyond that can not use it which is unfortunate i also live in canada and the dive here are in cold water requiring a dry suit i question how the watch would perform when it is snowing outside and you are at 100ft great start however and seeing a i spent dollar1500 on my shearwater teric for diving i could stomach this purchase to have all the feature standard to the apple watch while also being able to stick with me during my more out there activity
652,why this video look more brighter and contrast
653,drootb what is wrong with you
654,shut up
655,my biggest issue is just the battery life i do not need the extra feature on the watch but it wa so infuriating with my apple watch 4 when i wanted to go for a 2 hour mountain bike ride i realised i had not charged it during the night because of sleep tracking or morning i forgot the really short battery life really is a big issue because you are supposed to be wearing it 24 7 and you really need to plan on when you charge it daily
656,i use all apple product except the watch i prefer garmin it last more than a week and i run almost everyday charging smart watch daily is nonsense especially when it cost a lot
657,my apple watch se last almost all day
658,patrick howie i am not going to bother with a device that requires daily planning on my part for it to do what it is supposed to 3 day of battery life in normal use is something that a watch need at minimum
659,did you say the siren feature can be heard from a quarter mile away sorry but i call b
660,not good enough for the prize the battery life dude stop promoting junk
661,garmin gt apple watch ultra
662,i am waiting for an apple watch to look aesthetically pleasing a circular thin with chamfer will be awesome but having a square with flat edge like their phone will be stunning
663,agamerjoinedyt it ha those curve for sure it doe not look good a some other watch the only thing that set the apple watch apart is the software and brand
664,chamfer
665,akkar unbekannt feel more like some android that the iphone 3
666,akkar unbekannt the watch doesnt look good is ur opinion plus it doe not hive iphone 3 vibe it nowhere near those curve
667,agamerjoinedyt it is possible and the watch doe not look good there are also more watch out there with more battery life right now apple watch give me iphone 3 design vibe round and square with curving surface
668,ultimate frisbee is not a sport
669,here is me with a huawei gt2 just doe watch thing with health fitness sleep tracking last up to 3 week on one charge and the titanium build quality is very nice
670,brother you do not burn 2k calorie play ultimate for 3hrs that is inaccurate
671,meanwhile i am wearing my withings smart watch and it last about 27 day on a single charge
672,why are you wearing it on the right hand
673,i love ultimate frisbee wish there were people playing in fl
674,lmao 800 buck talk about disposable income
675,this would have been nice in a smaller watch face for woman and those with smaller wrist
676,tbh this wa is appealing simply because of the battery increase personally i would take a slightly chunkier watch for an extra while day of battery any day my main gripe with my apple watch 45mm series 7 aluminum is that if i wear it all day and sleep with it the next day it is almost dead and i have to charge it before going about my day the 2 day life would be amazing
677,it charge faster too
678,i personally believe cell phone killed the use for any watch
679,dollar800 hell nah
680,for me it is the bigger screen hitting fifty while i can still see 500 yard away i can not see anything close up for shit the 49mm screen let me use this watch without glass giving me a few more year of assist free smartwatch goodness
681,i said nice at the exact same time you did haha
682,all this ruggedness doesnt make any sense with this huge unprotected screen on top
683,you will not accidentally hit the action button if you wear the watch in your left hand also you are a guy
684,would have liked to see the battery life compared to other smart watch i do not think anyone expects them to be even remotely comparable to regular watch haha
685,garmin fenix 18 day apple ultra 2 day apple watch 1 day automatic watch unlimited day
686,mine go day without a charge
687,my garmin venu 2 last about 11 day on one charge i use it for heart rate stress level energy level which ha gotten more and more accurate the more i use it and step tracking i do have the option for weather and text message and other stuff since it connects to my iphone but i always have my iphone on me or within 4ft of me so no need for those option plus it make the battery last longer thanks to amazon i have tried multiple smart watch and i am most content with my garmin venu 2 the new apple watch doe look super cool but for dollar800 i would rather put that money to other apple product tbh i am not even a fan of the apple headphone so i returned those might try out this new apple watch but just to try it out and return it later on shout out to amazon fr the return policy is so long it is basically a trial period lol
688,well yeah normal watch do not have a screen on them
689,faq apple amp your faqing vids
690,this watch cost more than my iphone 11 lol
691,really is a good looking watch i do go hiking but it suck it come in one color which suck i hope they come out with different color next year and apple is one of the beast of company and other company r catching up quickly
692,10 meter under water is still pretty extreme lol average person doe not really go more than 3 ever
693,would love a video on how and if you can replace your phone with this and an ipad
694,yes i completely agree
695,it is dam ugly got to admit that
696,you did not wan na draw on an ipad you had to use piece of paper
697,expecting the apple watch ultra pro and then the apple watch ultra pro max
698,watch my og casio
699,i find these smart watch thingies kinda redundant i would perhaps care when they last for at least a week which even that feel way too short a battery life for what they are trying to replace
700,i find that you should only call something pro when it is for professional use meaning that the activity job constitutes making the majority of your income also known a the defenition of professional
701,i wa looking for something like this in better design finally apple re leased now i can pair it with my iphone
702,it is just more ijunk that ijunkies will pay waaayyyy too much for lol
703,practice
704,put a m1 chip in it
705,still doe not have enough battery to do a full triathlon sticking with sport watch like the garmin who own this option
706,mkbhd regarding the option of having it in black it can be completely anodized with type 2 anodizing which build a thick oxidized layer on a very dark grey look into it with the plus of adding wear or scratch resistance in my opinion to add this look actually would be pretty neat but is up to apple to decide
707,i bought a dollar25 fake one thats is perfectly fine for what i use these watch for
708,you people have dollar800 for a watch you would be better off putting that money under the mattress for this recession we are in because it is only going to get worse
709,but watch like garmin fenix last for week so what give
710,garmin us different screen technology i do not remember what is it is called but it greatly increase battery life caveat is the screen is not a good visually especially the sapphire version which is fairly dim for me i prefer the durability of my fenix over the apple watch 3 i had i have seen video where apple is sapphire is not a good a garmins gerryrigeverything ha a video about it
711,yes finally more eletronic waste
712,i have an iwatch and i rarely wear it but when i do all i use it for is to look at the time on it
713,pls do video how apple copy product are made
714,the charging thing is why i will not ever buy a smart watch seiko do kinetic watch for much le but look much nicer
715,dollar800 for something that will depreciate at what 25percent a year bro come one get an rolex seiko omega tag anything and you will still have penny on the dollar after 4 year get an apple watch and if you do not break any law you will have a liability to throw away that po and recycle it properly awesome expense but it is an expense not what i would call jewelry if you have a phone computer or tablet there is zero value add fucking garbage in term of tangible value
716,i would prefer a minimalist look
717,nice try apple but i am still not giving up my garmin fenix 6 pro
718,i have one of these ultra watch and i completely agree with this video it is capability are definitely over kill for me i would have been fine with the regular iwatch i hit the gym often and it is nice that it track everything for me but i do not plan on hiking up a mountain or diving in the ocean
719,gyrfalcon73 i own a pixel watch which is tiny thinking about going all apple and so getting a watch i am really scared of the size of the ultra lol
720,francisco muniz i wear the ultra to bed everyday doe not snag on sheet or bother me though i can understand why someone might not want to wear a big watch to bed this is definitely one of those personal preference thing
721,redwheelbarrow no i never wear it to bed the ultra is too bulky and can get snagged in the sheet it is very uncomfortable for sleeping nice feature is that the watch doe have a night screen mode so you do not accidentally blind yourself in the middle of the night my old fit bit wa more comfortable to wear personally i would not recommend this watch unless you really are the adventurous type or just want to flex on people i am a physical therapist so one of the down side is how it is bulky when you are working with your hand kinda wish it wa a slimmer design hence i would just recommend the 8 over the ultra
722,this wa going to be until i remembered that i am a climber
723,you guy are allowed to wear apple watch during a match that is the only compelling that is not a sport argument i have ever heard lol
724,my dollar24 casio watch never need to be charge for over 5 year not to mention how much time i save not looking at it
725,it is all up to each person to determine wether the purchase of this watch is worth it to them in my opinion it is bigger ha a few more feature longer battery more durable and i think i wa looking for something more that stood out to me my current apple watch will suffice until something truly unique to me stand out and i can not justify spending dollar800 on this watch when my significan not other purchased one for about dollar500 for me a a christmas present not even two year ago excellent review btw i found this helpful
726,you can buy it in 2 4 year buying a new one after 2 year is kinda a waste
727,should i switch my watch to my other wrist to when i drive lol jk it is def a more aesthetically pleasing shot good stuff a always edit oh nvm my b you really do wear on the right
728,i got mine today i am just a couch potato that will never use it to it full potential but i got it to motivate me into doing more outdoor activity i guess thats enough reason for me i love it so far
729,seth p then his as need too go shit like this doe not actually motivate or make discipline my whole family doe this shit just consuming hoping it help them get healthy
730,seth p well good on them i guess the dollar800 could have gone towards quality clothes or ideal footwear you know item that make working out easier to exercise those are the real motivator
731,jamar d what if they already have a gym membership
732,what a waste dollar800 you really could have gotten a gym membership a stated the gear you could have brought with that money man
733,you should spend 800 on gym or pair of shoe to cut those fat
734,i would be surprised if this thing even tell the time at this point
735,then surprise
736,why are people mad about the apple watch price normal watch cost 300 dollar to million of dollar
737,no just no
738,can i just get the beat off your video lol
739,what a complete waste of money and technology apple is such a demoralizing entity it sap every ounce of hope from our heart
740,never really been much of a watch guy but i hate how much i use my phone and carry my phone with me this may just be the pill i need now that the battery life is getting better
741,speaker part for the watch would you be able to listen to podcasts music other listening apps via sport apps from the ultra watch without headphone my apple watch 7 doe not allow me to do that without my headphone
742,a phone call is audio come through the built in speaker music audiobooks and podcasts need an iphone or bluetooth headphone
743,seth dia you are wrong there is an app for it
744,no
745,yes
746,lol ai is becoming more and more integrated into the human specie many people still sadly fast asleep a to what is really going on
747,i do not like black accessory anymore now that i have glaucoma and cataract i prefer brighter color
748,best watch ever thanks for review
749,jesus christ love u so much he died on the cross for our sin and rose from the grave put your faith in jesus
750,my garmin fenix last a month with more practice feature apple is dropping the ball with their cookie cutter model and lack of big innovation i have been an apple gear head for 20 year but sadly the company ha lost it luster
751,i feel they are more focused on the computer market because they are making big stride there now
752,i wish the apple watch ultra wa euros800 in europe
753,i like the look of apple watch i also owned an apple watch but tbh i think it is just a bit gimmick i do not care about my heart rate during the day notification make me look on the watch i see the notification and then i grab my iphone and still have the phone in my hand so it took two step to respond instead of one and the activity ring come on people just live healthy you know what is healthy take a walk everyday or go out for a run and just enjoy the activity for the real competitive athlete i assume a heartratesensor for on your torso is super accurate and cost somewhere around dollar euro 50 just do not be so crazy to buy an a watch of euros800 that becomes obsolete in a couple of year
754,nah simply for the additional burden of replacing it along with your phone a disposable tech get a real watch instead and leave the constant replacement to your already overpriced phone
755,just ordered mine before the review haha thank god it is a good review
756,og markach broun li
757,this watch is great but i use my scuba diving watch for my scuba diving class
758,if you are spending that sort of money and opt for this over a garmin fenix 7 you are a tool
759,i wa gon na get this but then i found a shrek digital watch where you open his mouth to see the time and it wa only like dollar20 so i got shrek watch instead
760,look too goofy to me
761,good review brother i feel a lot better with my purchase which is understandable because it is a dollar800 apple watch that is the same price a a standard iphone 14 i think there should be an extreme review whereas they drop it or emulate it being bumped against the corner etc i say that because i really want to know how robust this titanium hold up against real world situation the 44mm se i got did not hold up to these situation a such especially with the band that wa included for it unlatched too easily for with this new ultra i like the different option offered for i went with the alpine loop green color most importantly i like the size of the screen for it appears to be not too big but big enough to see everything without having to pull it close to your face it also appears to feel more like a traditional watch a compared to the 44mm se it wa the biggest screen at the time but compared to the ultra it is tiny can not wait until mine get shipped out for there is a back order on them so i will not receive mine including my 14 pro until christmas eve is eve but watching your review make me think it will be worth the wait
762,dollar800 donated to apple very overpriced
763,i bought a dollar25 fake one thats is perfectly fine for what i use these watch for
764,no watch is worth gbp800
765,nahh it is expensive amp hoogly square watch
766,it also titanium a the normal watch are aluminium some people can not handle the aluminium case so it on one side nice there now an option for those people but it sad it cost 800 buck
767,if you use the watch with multiple feature it is not going to last for 2 day and night and so emergency feature like the siren are not a effective for them i wish they came with a solar edition but they will not why would they want to kill their annual ritual of launching new version
768,not yet i have two apple watch but garmin fenix 6x pro is my watch it give me 3 week of juice for that price i want at least 1 week of juice from apple watch and not 2 day
769,the social dilemma is a real thing and you do not mind
770,how come no one is calling you out for what you do like you are talking about most of the population but you do not care about that you will never spend time on anyone unless they are extremely rich
771,the apple watch on steroid
772,i might want this one instead of the 8 i wan na get one for my birthday present lol
773,me too i want it for my birthday
774,why doe one need to track their sleep make it make sense to me smh
775,i got one bc it look cool and is more durable i broke my last apple watch and it wa not worth it to fix really happy with the best apple watch they make
776,mason griffith i broke my connected 44mm se too i wa delivering package and went to lift a big heavy box and the band unlatched and fell which cracked the screen crazy thing is that it only fell about a foot cracked like i dropped it from a 2 story house it wa still operable but it lost it waterproof capability and just looked ugly with the crack in the bottom left corner which started to spread like a crack on a car is windshield however the ceramic coating on the back stood intact it lasted for about a year before the screen gave out for it looked like a black ink pen exploded i got this 44mm se when they did not have otter box for it yet these new ultra is do not have them neither that i know of maybe because it is titanium i really hope and firmly believe it will last tho titanium is one of the hardest metal so i am expecting it to be of good quality like an traditional expensive watch we shall see after a few year is if these word is hold any titanium
777,i have broken two both ceramic backing that still need to be addressed imo
778,how did you get twitter on your watch
779,a a watch guy never in my life would i ever pay dollar800 for that product and i especially would never pay dollar99 for a damn strap
780,what a great review just perfect
781,stainless steel apple watch 8 cost dollar749 and the ultra dollar799 so much to unpack here
782,laith zain same here it is a gimmick but i made sure to go for the right watch
783,brian washington their pricing strategy i fell for it i wa like i need a watch def going to invest in stainless steel to have it for longer time but then when i compared the price i wa like i will take the better battery and bigger screen for extra dollar50
784,i wa saying the same thing
785,what about for senior not just young athlete legibility calling for help etc
786,just got the watch today so watching this ha been a great help many thanks
787,waiting for the black anodised version and i require training readiness training load and recovery metric
788,my dad might still be in contact with her
789,if you are lost in the wood your best bet is to have a green laser and to signal so with it into the night sky
790,just bought one first apple watch in year always wanted something a little bit more rugged with more battery
791,the ring you put bro are wrong in my opinion the ring are dependent on how much cash you have not what you desire
792,and then there a garmin fenix7
793,bruh never even said if he felt it wa worth it or not him
794,you know what they say once you go black you never go back
795,doe not really make sense comparing a typical watch to essentially a phone on your wrist of course it ha to charge
796,lol they finally did it i have been in apple ecosystem for a while but i do not find the apple watch really helpful the old watch will not even last a marathon or ultramarathons that take 10 hour that is why most runner i know spend on pricey garmin or suunto multisport watch this is also the reason why i stick with my miband for now because i prefer the sleep and heart rate tracking functionality with battery lasting 5 7 day do not know will check it maybe in the future i am already lazy charging my phone airpods and macbook i prefer if they can build the watch battery to last one week cuz yah know it is just a watch lol
797,that is just the price to charge it everyday day for a month
798,every watch is worth it if you use it wisely lol
799,your voice doe not match but helpful video thanks
800,you need to retire and give someone else a chance
801,it is only 40 meter fool
802,ulyimate frizzbie practice
803,apple is creating the urkle effect between the apple computer watch and the upcoming apple glass apple is turning all of you into nerd one product at a time be a man and wear a real watch
804,upgraded from my series 4 aluminum difference is night and day
805,biggest draw for me is that fact that it look way better than the normal apple watch i can not see myself buying the normal one and none of the alternative have the same connectivity just suck that i have to pay 800 for a better looking apple watch
806,yeah buy this if you are for forced labor in china apple want big government to kill it upstart competitor if you love freedom then you can not love apple
807,your review are the absolute best i know that your opinion just really is based on fact
808,0 42 it is not fair you have theatre mode that turn off always on so make a better review on battery next time but for the rest keep it going
809,i am a beginner alpinist who climb above 13 and 14 thousand foot and i definitely would not mind an avalanche alarm great gps a well a long battery life plus tracking calorie and fitness stuff during bjj or rock climbing and the gym would be great
810,great review when apple add the pro name it is because of increased technology the ultra ha increased technology and increased durability so i agree with apple is naming decision
811,i think pro more added feature for advanced apple user ultra the product almost peaked it is perfection in all category any added improvement will be overkill
812,i grabbed it to test against my garmin dive board nab board first haho jump in yuma wa flawless really impressed
813,so you no dey go church on sunday
814,how big are your wrist i have skinny wrist so just wondering for context
815,how would you do that effect at 1 09 i think you might have used some practicals but im not sure
816,how much is it coat you for the whole watch is it worth it
817,that is an ugly watch lol
818,i do not even use a watch i got the time on my phone
819,you are a borring tech reviewer
820,watch manufacturer are building watch that can last decade some even century why apple make watch that get damaged so fast is that done on purpose
821,dude watch like the casio pro trek are not smart watch it take more than solar to power a computer on your wrist ease up
822,amazon sell the silicon cover for the ultra watch in different color so you can get a black one what marque brown watch do you wear the most what phone do you use daily
823,i been debating on getting the ultra because i like the orange display at night and screen size and the orange band but i want to know what health feature it ha i have never had an apple watch the last thing is i feel like it would be too much tech i have an iphone 11 pro my second iphone ever and an ipod any suggestion for getting it
824,the apple watch ultra is ultimately apple is pro watch it ha the pro feature like an action button pro apps sensor biggest battery life and is the strongest overall it depends on what you will use it for but it is twice a expensive a the apple watch series 8
825,i got it for the battery life
826,cracked 800 dollar when the 500 dollar samsung higher quality what is apple business plan pissing off there fan base jesus
827,how doe this watch do compared to a suunto 9 baro watch
828,try 2 week huawei smart watch
829,my fenix 5x from 2017 get like 2 week between charge lol
830,this is the most boring review i have ever seen it wa like nail on a chalk board
831,quite frankly i do not know how ultra marathoner or cyclist can use this the battery at best is 30 hour without any function if you use the gps or any other fuction when working out i am guessing at best get 7 hour of battery life for longer race this without a recharge is tough
832,soooo good i stopped wearing real watch
833,really great revuew bought watch based on this review and my wife is insistence thank you been a long time since i saw one of your review but you rock thank you
834,2000 calorie is like 2 kcal
835,i think that a segment of people who will most likely never buy a apple watch are the watch enthusiast people ironically people who buy watch for their glamour and long term investment value and fashion and because of this buying an apple watch doe not really fit within that world because a you need to wear it daily which mean that you wont be wearing your other fancy watch and b it will be obsolete in 5 year meanwhile old fashioned watch can be handed down across generation
836,it is too fat
837,is this your main watch
838,watch look amazing but honestly if i am on a multi day hike off the grid i am not going to rely on apple watch w a 2 3 day battery life suppose it work for some scenario though
839,i went into the apple store in glasgow scotland yesterday to look at the apple ultra watch apparently they only stock the model with the concrete bezel cause this thing weighs a ton attractive to marathoner and triathletes no if eluid kipchoge had worn the apple ultra to try the sub 2 hour marathon he would have been lucky to break 2 day nevermind 2 hour nice watch doe all the gimmicky apple stuff but i will stick with my garmin 945 doe all the marathon and triathlete stuff light a a feather and can not even remember the last time i charged it but it wa way longer than 2 day ago did enjoy the video tho
840,i wa looking at the price and this is in a bit of a weird spot if you want stainless steel sapphire glass in 45mm it is either the stainless steel cellular series 8 or a tiny bit more and you can get the ultra with a larger screen and it feature lol i wish the gps only version wa not only in aluminium option having another cell plan for a watch just doe not make any sense in my use case especially outside of the u where not every cell provider even give you that option lol
841,that look more like a dollar 10 dollar square gadget from the family dollar store smart watch are decade behind in technology and charging the watch every night is a nuisance
842,i have to say something i have been using apple watch 5 since it release the display ha cracked and crown wa gone over this time one fixed from pocket one fixed by apple if i had an ultra these will not be happen i am just a normal everyday user it is only 100euros difference between steel version of series 8 and ultra so if the design is ok there is no excuse for using apple watch series 8
843,no way mine 24 hour and got it down to 37percent no way is going to last me 2 more day
844,yeah but my 200dollar seiko can last longer without a battery and doesnt need a gps
845,it is really cool to see how your membership ha grown i remember you when you started good for you kid
846,blow my mind they still have not added golf into the watch
847,and no chess either
848,casio have different technology
849,this wa a helpful video thanks
850,you talk to much get to the point
851,100m water resist mean something different
852,i can not wait for gary rig to bust one of these open
853,definitely reminds me of a marine diver watch
854,what do you recommend how do we charge this watch just in i usually charge my iphone when it at 20percent and i stop at 90percent my samsung s3 or anyother smart watch are always on charge when i am not using them which is not a good idea what about this watch
855,where did you find nike running band for the ultra or can i use the 45mm thx
856,you can use the 45mm
857,i wonder how viable it would be to develop a trickle charge ability tapping into body heat and kinetic energy from moving it about combined with some advanced solar tech the battery could potentially last way longer of course size is an issue too
858,let me say this if your in tha mountain on a hunt bring your iphone 14 pro max and leave your watch off unless you need it for search and rescue and if your in tha cold put it in cloth and put in it in your pocket
859,no way it worth 800 i ld buy a good clone every time over the overpriced and over hyped apple
860,look what the watch did to your vein
861,excellent video purchased my ultra yesterday and love it purchased 1 black and 1 white cover from amazon and they ad protection and give you a custom look nice
862,huawei the king of the baterry life
863,i am dating myself but this reminds me of the old casio calculator watch from back in the day
864,a a hiker and a diver man did they make this watch for me i can not wait until the next version come out so i can get this one for cheaper lol
865,you should not dive in this it only 10bar 100m
866,im only half through the video but i wish there wa more comparison to similar watch other smart watch
867,i got one for sale i did not really like this watch anyone interested let me know i will provide pic and whatever else it is authentic dollar650
868,i do not even use my apple watch ultra for workout anymore it keep locking on me because it think it is off of my wrist since i have tattoo on my wrist therefore it block the optical reader it is completely annoying and the only way to stop it is to take off the apple pay but then it still will not read my heart rate my garmin fenix 7x sapphire solar heart rate only work if i push it below the knob on my wrist but the garmin pay always work and the watch never lock on me also the apple watch doe not count rep in the gym and that is ridiculous i where my garmin to support me on workout and the apple ultra for day to day when i am not working out i strap the garmin to my ankle so i can still get the metric not to mention the battery life is so much better on the garmin i am an amateur athlete but my workout can last up to 6 hour with a long run boxing biking and weight i also compete in ultramarathons and i will only trust my garmin for that
869,ultimate frisbee practice
870,i love your channel keep up the good work
871,so ugly apple device used to be defined by their product design
872,ultra expensive but definitely worth it for apple and their shareholder
873,dollar800 no
874,i climb mountain and ever since i saw this watch i have wanted it sadly since i am still in high school i am broke
875,bro dt no 1 chinese company making exact high class clone of these apple watch 95percent le price amazing feature very popular in asia these day
876,i have seen people with it and it is made me want it i do not need it at all but i want it it looked so cool being worn by anyone who i saw with it i will probably buy one and keep my midnight series 7 along side it
877,i am now using a 44mm apple watch series 5 and it is quite big on my wrist already the apple watch ultra is going to look ridiculous on my wrist
878,i get 48 hour out of a v6
879,can you change the rainbow color setting on the burned calorie counter
880,way too big yes the strap should definitely attach to the case from the middle of the body or even a tad higher so it taper more naturally towards the wrist and not a low a it is now which make it have the computer on the wrist look you perfectly said which also look kind of goofy i agree that the normal apple watch in 45mm is big enough and can be used in any setting this ultra not so much i would design a bigger watch but quite thinner which is worn on the other side of the arm and horizontally and give me all the info i wanted by a turn of my arm i mean that would be at least a futuristic thing btw all these diver watch from every brand are just stupid i mean how much of the population is going to actually dive instead of diver watch they should be called marine or what people really want waterproof and that is it
881,hi marque and all others side question i just got one to see if i like it wa going for the fenix 7 solar but this save me a few buck so i wanted to try it first question do you all use a case and screen protector i use one on my apple watch 7 but it impairs my use of swiping and the keyboard a lot should i need one for this watch disclaimer i have a titanium citizen and i think titanium scratch easy from that watch answer are all appreciated thanks
882,will they ever just fix or solve the tattoo problem most athlete have tattoo also a lot of consumer who want they nicer thing in life have tattoo
883,if it hold up to mustard it is worth it
884,why is the watch switching between his left and right arm for every shot
885,i bought this specifically to get on the trail more often i pay about dollar1 12 per day for payment to help encourage me to get out the door so far it ha worked i do 1 hour plus trek with a weighted back on and try to do 15 min mile including hill and rough terrain with my pack on this is definitely a more military friendly watch
886,promoting 2 day of battery life give me the shittiest feeling it should be atleast a week which other smart watch maker like fitbit and garmin offer
887,i really want a watch that doe body fat percentage so far the only watch i know that doe that is the samsung galaxy 4 doe this latest iphone do it
888,so today 11 10 22 after having the ultra for about a month now i put my series 8 back on wore it for about an hour and then put ultra back on can not go without ultra actually when i workout i think the ultra syncs up faster with my workout apps than the 8 i use pedimeter to track my daily step and it syncs well with it i know it is bigger and little heavier although to me doe not feel that much heavier than the series 8 my workout are not extreme i just do treadmill or walk outside stationary bike and total gym and love it for that heck i live 10 minute from the smoky mountain i might climb a mountain just because
889,im wondering why apple do not just add solar auto recharging capability just like casio
890,casio g shock and other solar casios do not have a big bright oled screen and battery wasting feature so they require le power which mean a smaller solar panel the apple watch could not fit a solar panel big enough to power it
891,this watch is amazing the only downfall for me wa the size did anyone not think that a female would want this if it is big on a man it is wa even bigger when i tried it on pls make more size
892,this is the best watch i have ever seen the designer of this watch need to be promoted or replace the ceo of apple who keep giving u same phone design for decade we need new rugged strong long lasting with smooth ui like io inside
893,got my series 7 nike edition to replace my series 2 it is good for me till 2028 or 2030
894,in india the same watch cost 1000 dollar thanks to custom department
895,wish they would do a iphone ultra with a huge battery some of u do not care about having the thinnest lightest phone eh
896,sheecun nuggetz
897,shud hav made it round
898,it is just too big not all of u are large people with big hand long limb
899,my only worry about skipping this watch for next year watch ultra is that the price will either raise or they will keep the s6 2020 chip for a fourth year in a row but i am definitely waiting and i am hoping next year ultra ha exclusive feature to the ultra with more colour option even smaller bezel being able to see more with the big screen instead of the same a 45mm where even though the 49mm ultra is bigger you are seeing the same content where a you are seeing le on the 41mm an actual new chip in it will be great too one thing i know apple will not do is give u the option to choose what colour the action button will be i would have picked red action button with navy blue or black casing big hope is for a new chip inside instead of a rebranded one like they did last year and this year even smaller bezel and more feature longer battery life 36 hour is not enough it may be for others but it genuinely is not more watch face wired charging for longer battery health
900,ill buy it when they drop an all black version
901,a a technical diver this piece of tech ha me intrigued it certainly will not be replacing any dedicated dive computer but i could see myself using this a a backup for dive under 40 meter
902,i am willing to bet you could use the apple watch a a complete dive computer replacement with tank psi integration there are a bunch of wireless dive computer already a developer or dive gear company would just have to make a tank pressure transmitter that would communicate wirelessly with the apple watch ultra that would actually be incredibly cool and at dollar799 a rather inexpensive dive computer
903,apple need to sign you or somebody ur soooo good with content and delivery along with the picture you keep my attention and your voice is soothing
904,ultra sound better tbh
905,thank you for the clarity
906,body fat percent would be awesome if the put one in maybe nect year
907,lol samsung take pro for the galaxy watch 5 pro and apple watch ultra
908,the battery kill it for me i have gotten over a week battery life out of my garmin watch
909,i am interested for backcountry skiing and sailing i wish there wa a start timer with the action button so i do not need to touch the screen to start stop and reset a 3 min timer i have heard you can set it to shortcut so that might work backcountry skiing i know it would be useful for waypoints but i do bring a physical map and write out my route just in case even if i have a handheld garmin but those are expensive af and i usually borrow my friend my biggest concern is it sticking out in everyday formal use might keep my series 4 with a leather band around for that
910,a a mountain biker this is the first apple watch that appeal to me because it is finally rugged enough to withstand a real crash some of the nav and fitness feature still do not measure up to the higher end garmins etc but the one thing that really make the apple watch stand out is the ability to talk and text without being tethered to a phone to be able to set out into the wilderness without carrying a bulky phone but still be connected is something that still is not offered by garmin but previous apple watch gave up too many other feature to be justifiable for a true outdoor enthusiast and at dollar800 it is still cheaper than a garmin fenix 7
911,bummer that i will not be able to make it work with my outfit for the met gala
912,i had it for 15 day and returned it absolutely a waste of money it is heavy big and cost too much and also do not allow you to play music from source like youtube music you have to carry your phone spotify you still need your phone so no it is not worth the money
913,it just look so un ergonomic like how did apple design this blocky looking thing that doe not contour whatsoever to human wrist anatomy
914,first thing i notice is you rock it with the button closer to u i never wear my watch like that always button closer to hand not elbow
915,this thing look f ckn awesome
916,skinny wrist i reckon it look perfect bro d
917,that screen is huge it is like having a phone on your wrist
918,my second apple watch and i love it the first one i took back a i hated it but this one i love if anybody is worried about how big it might be it really is not that big in fact my first impression wa that it wa way smaller than i expected
919,watching you on flagrant wa fun
920,unnecessary tech
921,your very valid post of battery life is why i have not yet bought a smartwatch my mechanical watch work by the wearer moving or my g shock solar make it easy to pick up the next morning in a rush and go having to charge my watch is something i am not accustomed to probably will not ever be lol it is a nice piece but a a diver i will stick to my tried and true purpose built dove computer with 30 plus year in the business
922,just found out the real kicker the oceanic app will be subscrition based so if you want to actually use it a a dive computer it is gon na cost you 5 dollar day 10dollar mo or 80dollar y this just automatically disqualifies this watch for me by the time you pay for the watch and the subscription you are allready at the garmin descent territory mk2 which still function a a watch and a dive computer you can use for free
923,there is one point i would like to find out that apple watch ultra is targeting extreme weather sport i just wonder that how the battery design facing those condition are they using enduro battery design
924,i love how they used ultra for this watch and how everything about this watch is different from the others and i am coming from a 7 nike and se
925,i love mine like crazy
926,dude what is with the scar on your hand how when did that happen
927,the fact that he price on this watch is not so far from the pro or the pro max is not worth it and you did not mention that for the diver you need the payed version of the app
928,the whitest sounding black guy ever
929,your ad are way too long unsubscribe
930,is the screen edge a dent chip magnet
931,1 45 then you can have afro hair cut
932,absolutely love this watch best apple watch to date overall regardless of how you want to use it in my opinion visit a store that ha one on display and put your hand on it may not be for everyone but this watch will surely be an enormous hit especially during the christmas season
933,meanwhile my series 7 can barely make it the whole day relatively new bought it back in july of this year with just a bit of use
934,the simple thing i want my apple watch to do is call gps whatsapp uber and upi transaction
935,i want to learn to freedive but do not want to buy any more watch i have a garmin fenix already but doe not do depth if i am gon na buy a smartwatch this ha to be the one though i do not think i will use it to it fullest
936,why would you make a 15 minute video without using youtube chapter
937,not repairable once broken hence just waste of money
938,this would be awesome for military tbh
939,love mine best watch ever
940,i also think professional traveler and casual traveler will appreciate that they can be without a charger for a weekend trip or overnight business trip
941,thank you quick question is it possible to wear it reversed so that you must turn your hand over to see the face
942,799dollar yeah in europe this watch cost 999euros which is 200dollar euro whatever more and let be real for a watch which cost more than iphone itself ultra is overpriced cmon people switch your grey matter and look on this trough the prism of reality not trough the apple marketing glass ffs you spend more or le the same amount of money for watch and phone that is just ridiculous for that price this ultra deception is bullshit watch ultra is worth maximum 700dollar euro p s do not forget that there is people living beyond usa and some if not the most of main feature of watch ultra doe not work in the end it turn out that people who get le pay more unbelievable
943,i switched from samsung to iphone so i could get this watch i got it what is disappointing is it doe not function a a stand alone device for text message very disappointing
944,pro ultra is next generation
945,it is really a device like all other smart watch it will never be a watch that increase in value like an actual watch
946,can i have it please
947,how doe the aw handle a feature like fall detection when you are playing a sport like ultimate frisbee since you are diving and hitting the ground doe it call 911 or something without you realizing it i read thing about the crash detection having false flag during rollercoaster ride for example
948,simply turn fall detection off before workout
949,can not afford it but loved it
950,i love the look of the ultra and the hardened feature but i hesitate to spend dollar800 on a watch that is battery will degrade in a couple year time no matter what you do i will stick with the normal apple watch for almost half the cost of the ultra
951,my friend bought it and i put it on my tiny wrist hilarious
952,google really dropped the ball we have so many watch out and what we got is a meh decent first watch but they are up against this they have had year sigh
953,phenomenal review man
954,hi marque a i await delivery of my ultra aka pro lol i am watching youtube video to get ready i am in that far outer circle for a different reason i have lupus and hypersensitive skin so have had to resell my previous apple watch android watch and two fitbits due to allergy i hope and pray this one will be the one i can tolerate due to the titanium and ceramic construction along with the woven band who would think those silicone band cause irritation
955,a couple thing 1 sleep tracking is useless you do not need a watch to tell you if you had a good night rest and it feel uncomfortable wearing a watch while sleeping i find it unnecessary 2 battery life is overrated at least in the aspect of comparing 60 hour to 1 week like other watch it take literally zero effort to put the device on a charger at night 3 this watch is not even big it also still light garmin amp suunto are literally monster and twice the price can not justify spending 1500 for a smartwatch but the 800 is just right i mean there are people who spend 2k on a regular watch that doe nothing but tell time having said that i am considering this now too i have the series 7 but the face is already scratched from kayaking trip and kettlebells i hike in warmer month and the extra battery is good for camping trip when i am outside for 2 day but definitely do not need a week worth of battery but a weekend worth is perfect the waypoint is definitely a game changer
956,dollar800 watch battery should last at least a week lmao
957,ultra user someone who want to go more than a day without recharging ffs this guy worry about paying some other company to paint his nearly 1kdollar watch seriously i can not stand watching this guy vids bc the only reason he get the view he doe is bc he is black cry bc it is true hate to break kit to this guy but outdoors ppl do not need a 2k oled for a flash light he is never camped in his life
958,a pro airpods pro user is in fact a person who owns the premium subscription on every music streaming service
959,i love apple but my fitbit go 8 day between charge
960,honestly the se ha worked fine for me forever i run around bang my hand into thing and it is still fine it is gotten to the point where i need a new watch and i got the se again
961,this is notification from mkbhd what is this new account for my giveaway thanks for watching and congratulation you have been selected among my shortlisted winner telegram only to claim your prize
962,bookedsam thank you
963,a scam
964,if battery last for more than a week then it name is suitable otherwise it is just name ultra
965,i wanted the larger screen forever i wanted a better speaker forever i also want to be able to use it more like phone without it being so small when my finger try to dial it is always hitting the wrong character
966,maybe there is another one one the way
967,it is called ultra to lure the ultra running community to buy this watch currently the ultra running community us garmin coros or something else other than apple
968,may be a dumb question but i think the majority of people that wear watch do so on the wrist opposite their dominate hand ie right handed folk would wear a watch on their left wrist the apple watch e appear to be constructed to be worn on the left wrist bezel oriented like a normal wrist watch do you find it any more difficult interacting with your watch wearing it on your right wrist do you cross over or under to operate the bezel for example thanks
969,your intro and presentation are the reason why you are the
970,imma be honest i am getting it because of the 49mm face i am a big man with a large athletic build and a big wrist and that bigger face would really just suite me better proportionately i do not like small watch on my wrist that is my main reason for getting it everything else is a bonus lol
971,any watch is a bad buy because in a few year it will be old outdated most people with stop wearing it by that time
972,this is why i hate smart watch a good g shock will last decade and if the battery dy it is easy to unscrew the back and put a new coin cell in
973,for the second group that doe long hiking it still miss too much good offline map are an essential thing which is missing on the apple watch and the battery life is still bad compared to the garmin watch specialized on that particular group the two band gps is not really knew other specialized watch have that too
974,god damn
975,now i understand the machine learning push by apple
976,someone give marque some damn lotion
977,wake me up when it can last a month
978,i wish there phone had this battery life personally i do not find the watch appealing i see no use for it
979,i thought i would be in to this watch using it the same a my other apple watch the battery will not last until evening the first day the cellular doe not work well enough to use alone without the phone spotify would not work with my airpods i could only play music i had downloaded to my watch the workout app constantly pause right in the middle of my workout i left my phone in the locker at the gym with cellular bluetooth and wi fi turned off and my watch kept trying to play music on it successfully instead of my airpods it is a cool looking watch though and it is not a huge watch like i keep hearing everyone say if you think it is huge you should probably eat more protein or something because you obviously have tiny dainty wrist
980,god damn it apple i hate you it beautifull first smartwatch that i would like to have but it so so expensive and i can not buy it right now god damn it apple
981,only silver killed it for me i am v large dood so wa really excited for the bigger size i just wanted a regular black aw with a bigger size
982,you compare the apple watch to a casio and you say that 2 day and night is not good enough in today is world can i have some of what you are smoking
983,a a military in battle
984,look like you got a ankle monitor on your wrist
985,your a nerd
986,do you think that apple will make an ultra 2 next year 2023
987,just from the thumbnail it look absurd on a wrist that small do you have a small wrist or is it just enormous
988,my ticwatch ha nearly all the feature here but dollar450 cheaper it seems apple could sell these for dollar1600 and some you man bun type would still buy it
989,so my issue is health monitoring and emergency help if needed can you tell whether there is a significan not benefit in term of health benefit between the 8 and the ultra
990,it is ugly
991,aviation
992,they need something for pilot
993,hey marque what app do you find best on apple watch for golfing
994,it a big watch for people with small wrist it normal to normal guy
995,i have always complained about the size of apple watch a a bigger guy so ty for this apple smaller watch just do not look right on my wrist this one feel so much more natural on me
996,i never liked how the apple watch looked so tiny this i can fuck with i am definitely getting this the look is dope
997,you know he passed the point into the middle of nowhere because there wa an orange safety cone
998,and there are some of people like me who can not afford it apple should think about them a well
999,calorie tracking on any type of watch smartwatch is way way off you have to cut that calorie burned number in half if not a quarter lol it is literally that off
1000,many thanks for the good video for the ultra watch
1001,ive watched a couple vids for this the se2 and the series 8 and tbh if it your first watch or you just need some key feature and apps i would go with the se2
1002,just ordered
1003,terrible review defined feel like a rushed video
1004,even that apple watch ultra is not even close to the huawei gt3 pro watch series yet
1005,why doe the apple watch on the title screen look like the duolingo bird coming for me
1006,ngl i am a hardcore android user but the apple watch ha me thinking and the more or le 3 day of battery ha me hooked just need to buy an iphone
1007,my situation too sound silly but the thing keeping me tied to my android phone is emulating game which is way harder on io
1008,emergency service in there website they have shown series 5 gps cellular series 6 gps cellular series 7 gps cellular and only series 8 without mentioning gps cellular
1009,hi marque super video again is there any platform where we can watch you playing a fresbie match i have never seen a professional level of this sport but because of you i want to see you playing it thank you if someone answer me have a nice day
1010,just buy a fking seiko watch are supposed to be timeless and these junk are not why even promote this shit
1011,got mine earlier today quite liking it not a big a i wa expecting but i do worry about that sapphire crystal it is so damn thin my other watch with sapphire crystal feel really solid anywhere from 3 5mm 4mm thick not certain of the spec for the apple watch crystal but just by the flex and the feel of it i doubt it is more than 1 5mm thick this thing is going to shatter really freaking easily
1012,those people on the outskirt use garmin fenixes ugh i would love an ultra but i wish it wa not a square that is the only reason that i will probably get another garmin
1013,i think that there will be runner or hiker or even diver buying these watch but honestly it is just a cool watch so i think most of them will be sold to people that do not mind spending a lot of money for the latest must have gadget from apple if i had dollar800 burning a hole in my pocket i would buy one just to have it
1014,one thing for scuba dive the app oceanic need a subscription that you have to pay for it dollar5 the day or dollar80per year well there is a free subscription but you do not have no deco time so basically it is not a computer dive without the payed one just one thing to consider something i forgot also his water resistance is up to 40m not 100m
1015,hahahah all of these avid insert outdoor activity talking about how said feature are so great i e compass yeah for pure convience while doing said activity it is great but that is it having an actual compass for when you are lost is still better than the bloody watch for being a compass great watch but thats that just a great watch it shouldnt be replacing a bloody compass if you are a hiker or have to go to remote place and you need a compass
1016,00 15 69percent battery nice mkbhd
1017,why you are driving shitty quality having tesla
1018,if apple want to be logic and revolutionary then why not make a band rather than a watch iband dnt gesture like an old fart and look at your watch instead look at your hand lmfao great commercial right there ur welcomed apple p i want 10percent of all profit for 10 year lmfao anyways the point is the screen interface crap should be on the other side of your wrist like when you look at your hand not wrist yeah yeah you will definitely scratch it but i mean is apple they can come up with impossible to scratch material
1019,watch design for right handed user can it be set to use on the right to allow for lefty
1020,yes
1021,can we scuba test
1022,i am leaving android just for this watch exactly what i am looking for
1023,this wa one of if not the best review of a piece of tech i have seen can not believe how far he is come incredible video man
1024,i need to know how can you hear a siren from a quarter mile away coming from such a small device
1025,main user of this watch are apple fan boy with deep pocket will ask santa
1026,the problem with apple watch is that most people only use them for fitness apps and aldarms and thing though i tried connecting to the internet on one person is a they let me and got a site the size of the screen can become impractically small some people say you do not need a watch if you have the time on your phone though i think that before long watch may replace pocket phone if one can get them to do everything a smart phone doe in fact many are now being made to pay online by flicking it like you would with a mobile payment app with a credit debit or gift card put on it i still use mobile with my gift card put on them to pay and rid the card safely when i do if smart watch are being made to do this and to have map the pocket cellphone will be old technology in a number of year to come
1027,it is cool but it is also going to be trash in a few year when you want an upgrade i would actually be interested in this watch if it wa more of a life time or 20 year proposition where the internal component could be updated paying this much money for something which will be obsoleted next year seems weird to me seems like an expensive toy i do have a garmin forerunner 945 i get week of battery and i love it it is a smart watch but it is also kind of dumb and feel like something i could have for a long time although i guess the battery will go sooner or later and it will be headed for the landfill
1028,yeh but casio doesnt run apps or have a bright a screen
1029,tag heuer connected edollar if you wan na throw the disc
1030,marq another great review i am one of the outlier i love the titanium and the orange band wa cool but in the end dollar800 for something i really do not need like you i have a casio mtg m900da and it keep perfect time solar powered take a licked and keep on ticking and cost me dollar120
1031,can i watch youtube on it
1032,that is great battery life but dollar800 i do not mind charging mine lol
1033,40m not 100
1034,3 hour ultimate frisbee practice
1035,they should try making the ultra longer battery maybe 5 day or up maybe all will drool on the watch i will want it if it 5days 2 day is ok but let be practical
1036,that beat
1037,thanks a lot for the info
1038,boy you are good
1039,i just bought one worth it
1040,for scuba diving do not be deceived the watch industry is kind of deceptive with their depth rating a wr100 sound like you can dive to 100ft but actually it is only rated for swimming or snorkelling for scuba you need a watch rated wr200 or more my current watch which i use to scuba dive is rated 20bar or 20 time atmospheric pressure that is what is needed to scuba dive
1041,i see myself using this for work the big button will help with work glove on
1042,i see myself using this for work
1043,ugh watching people wear their watch on the right arm irks me for some reason sorry great review though i have had an apple watch for a while now but i am thinking it time to upgrade finally
1044,let is forget about the apple watch and just admire marque is video quality
1045,just want to say that if i ever have a question about if to purchase something or not and you have done a review i can trust your review 100percent thank you for what you do my wallet hate you but i am a big fan
1046,a long a this thing look square hell no square watch are a huge no no watch are circular time go around an around f that
1047,can you compare it to the new 8 series
1048,i love to hike but my biggest fear is getting lost in the wood i think this will be very beneficial for my need
1049,free tibet
1050,i will solve this question for you really quickly anything made by apple is not worth the money they ask there you go i just created all your future apple is it worth it video for you
1051,it is the battery if you want an apple watch you would like to wear it all day then wear through the night at time to monitor sleep and health for the benefit it is designed to provide without charging it every day
1052,how easy is it to break
1053,had every apple watch since original upgraded from 7 to 8 then watched review of ultra including yours which i very much enjoyed after wanted an ultra but apple showed delivery a month out and verizon in december best buy site stated delivery in two day so i said ok and ordered one sure enough would have gotten in two day but delay with ups which hardly ever happens got it in three day not had it a week yet and have about another week and a half to return it i really like it but go back and forth whether to keep or return i like the bigger size and then i do not like the bigger size i like the bright screen then i do not like the brighter screen i like the design but then i do not like the design this is all compared to my 8 but then i do like the fact it is tough and i do not have to worry about damaging it i do not like the fact that i accidentally bought one with the small alpine loop band and best buy said they can not just swap band and would have to send watch and band back to get swapped or go to my local store an hour away which doe not have any in stock band work just hard to get on over my hand and i do not have large wrist and medium size hand there is a lot i like but is it worth dollar800 probably will keep it but if i do will also probably keep the 8 for dress up time although i wear a suit for work everyday a heck it is just money people would say to me you are crazy and even my wife who i love with all my heart even say so but i do not spend money on race car fishing boat camper motorcycle etc but my passion is tech stuff iphones apple watch home assistant device etc and these are thing i use everyday love your video thanks oh i do workout daily and love it for that
1054,get the black snap on protective cover like i am getting for mine
1055,an apple watch is limited to battery power apple should made it with solar charging i wait for generation 15 and when the price is dollar399 00 instead of dollar799 00
1056,a bit late here but i am looking for this watch when the model arrives to my country i have an se and week ago i had to call an ambulance because of my heart i am a heart transplant patient when the ambulance arrived the guy noticed my watch asked for my phone and check the daily rhythm and other stats he double checked with the machine and all after that he told me that maybe a series 7 or 8 would be nice cause it have other useful stats and i wa like ok then the doctor at the emergency room took my phone and did the exact same thing after spent the night at the emergency room i asked them about the watch they told me that they obviously double check everything with specialized machinery but the watch and phone give them an analysis of what wa happening earlier that day and week and is a reaaaally good addition now looking at the ultra i am tempted because battery alarm sound because i am 70percent deaf and all the stuff that the se do not have now is expensive but having those stuff make me feel a little le worried when i am outside in other country or similar situation i am not an extreme user a apple show in the video but i think all the people with heart disease love the watch and they could focus on that and have a lot of new potential user old people transplanted person etc
1057,this watch is around 1 200 where i live very expensive
1058,0 13 the way you grab the steering yoke is atrocious
1059,yo where did you get the pink bonsai tree in the background
1060,so lem me guess it straight apple expect u to buy a 1000dollar phone a 400 800dollar tablet and a 400 800dollar watch every 3 4 5 year a the battery becomes crap or the o becomes super outdated and or unsupported any middle class person who ha a family or a mortgage can not afford that crap unless you live on your credit card eat only unhealthy food like kraft diner r do not save money for rainy day it is not even close fun time we live in also all the environment friendly thing they claim to do when they try to push all these disposable gadget pure greenwashing android can be cheaper but is much worse for battery swapping or updating the o the only way i can afford gadget while paying my mortgage and being financially responsible saving money is buy them used in place like marketplace and run them into the ground until they basically explode
1061,it is called apple marketing bullshit that is it
1062,have you tried doing an elliptical workout with the ultra mine is over 200 calorie off disappointing tech support know of the flaw
1063,i really hope this will go down price soon so i can get it
1064,he wear his watch on right hand
1065,i am sold selling my series 7
1066,just taking a guess but if they continue to drop upgrade for the ultra it lead me to believe they would come out with a pro ultra or something like that with a little more to offer this one is awesome though and a great price for what it offer imo
1067,yes ultra ha to do with outdoors it a sport watch
1068,i photograph wild horse in incredibly remote area i have not tried it out yet on the range but i suspect it will be amazing and help to keep u safe gps compass the ability to backtrack i will return with review
1069,i would rather pay 130dollar and get a galaxy watch 4
1070,the diving feature is a bit of a you need to pay an extra subscription to really be able to use the dive feature that is a big no no for me so i ended up getting a garmin
1071,do you think apple watch 8 ultra is it useful for pilot
1072,i am neither of your option i am just a builder that is looking for the toughest watch to last on site is it with it
1073,good ad
1074,how are you clean the those watch from dirt and sweat
1075,i think it hideous tbh
1076,anything apple related is never worth it
1077,tbh we are going towards too much tech dependency had samsung watch but just going command now and just le hassle
1078,hell no an dollar800 watch that go down in value hell no
1079,a watch that is marked a waterproof to 100 metre will be of no use to you scuba diving the rating is wildly optimistic for swimming or snorkeling it would be alright but not scuba diving you would need at least a 200 metre depth rating and preferably more
1080,i can not stop thinking about how you are wearing the watch on the wrong hand
1081,rather bummed out that the watch doe not include a notification feature to alert the wearer when law enforcement ha requested location and other pertinent data and whether or not apple ha sent the data a requested that would be good info to know
1082,watch on left hand only bro please get a bracelet for your right hand
1083,it is also fugly
1084,garmin is better all day every day
1085,2 5 day of battery charge will have to wait till it hit atleast 7 day since this will not do well with multi day trek
1086,love mine so far waiting on update to put some other apps in the complication such a my fitness pal
1087,this is the actual reason they did not make a huge upgrade to the phone the time wa spent right here
1088,would be nice if watch had basic camera incorporated would be a cool add on
1089,i have a withings scanwatch it is not that smart a watch but it go about 4 week between charge apple ha just squared the reason i am still not buying any apple watch battery shape and size
1090,way too much intellectual b we are gathering in our mind to send u insane and then ultimately cause terrible anxiety wake up and use a normal watch turn your phone to silent and smell the rose that advice is free
1091,great review never owned an apple watch before i think i might go for it idk gon na have to try it on and see how it look
1092,got ta say intro have got to be one of the best i have ever seen on youtube
1093,until the next update that decrease your battery drastically lol
1094,i decided to charge my ultra and run it till the battery wa dead i performed my normal use a few phone call texting daily work out and kept on normal power mode and always on display i got exactly 54 hour and 10 minute big improvement
1095,anodized titanium will scratch off super easy it is basically just colored oxidation
1096,there is one more group of people that buy watch based on appearance it is chunky and le cute rounded it is great also is it ok to wear a massive richard mille rm 011 dollar300k watch with a tux but the apple watch ultra is too big
1097,i wonder how many feature the ultra ha by the way in new zealand we have a expression yeah nah i said yeah to the watch
1098,turn off cellular and tell u how long the battery lasted you never mentioned how well that worked
1099,honestly the most attractive thing about it is the material used to make it and the flat screen those alone make me want it a i would like a watch i do not need to have a case on at all time however i can not justify the price simply for that even if it is tempting
1100,and still after all these year the consumer is unable to have the ability to do something a simple a placing the time in the middle complication location why apple why
1101,what is that scar
1102,wait do not tell me it a tesla key
1103,drive me crazy that my samsung galaxy watch 4 will only last a little over a day i can not even use sleep tracking because it need to be charged i do not get it
1104,just ordered mine upgrading from the series 5 that i had
1105,no smart watch is worth it
1106,nah
1107,i think it cool that apple added all these feature to there watch but in my opinion it still can not compare to something like the garmin fenix 7 witch you can get for cheaper
1108,loving the series 8 since unboxing it
1109,the main question is have you used it when your phone is near by i have an apple watch series 4 and the battery doe not even last for 8 hour if i use it only with the cell option
1110,near future is big watch le phone with watch having full data capability
1111,they should have done a holographic one when you heat up titanium it turn into a beautiful look
1112,these intro man
1113,that apple watch look a million time better than any previous model i feel like if you complain about the size of the watch you must be a tiny human
1114,the tech goblin
1115,with ic today this watch could probably be 25percent smaller but then it probably would not be finger friendly
1116,the 40m limit is simply a safety problem i wa really hyped for that watch a a non apple fan a a diver i would like to see my depth at least till 60m we only go to 45m max but if you went deeper u would like to know it in order to consider it when ascending
1117,2 day lol fenix 7x take week to run out of battery even sense2 take almost whole week
1118,amazon already ha case skin for the apple watch ultra dollar5 each got a black and orange one
1119,some people work on a google server floor and would like the battery life flashlight data to not have their phone going through a metal detector all day and have health issue where finally temperature tracking is on the apple watch lol
1120,it is not worth it because it is just a watch their is not nothing really interesting in apple watch when the i phone are made for a reason
1121,the biggest problem with this apple watch is the price at that price it is in garmin fenix price point which ha a battery life of over 10 day it is feature are all higher spec that the apple watch it ha more accurate gps with 3 different source solar charging so the battery life is extended basically it ha load of feature that other watch already do better the lack of being able to connect to third party sensor like a chest strap is also frustrating if it were cheaper it would fill a space which doe not overlap with better device unfortunately it doe not
1122,great video
1123,yo man i just want to say how supremely impressive your video are you cover every logical angle and your production value is equally pro outstanding work sir
1124,i do not believe i heard you say but if you did my apology wa the run time you spoke of two day two night with or without cellular lte running i would assume no cellular running with that run time
1125,ultimate disk in
1126,this is watch is quite big and heavy tbh
1127,prbbly ultra phone is comming aswell thats why they introduce it now pro name is already old
1128,i feel like i am not alone here a someone who is a fitness junkie and garmin fenix 5 user wondering if i should upgrade decision decision
1129,dollar800 i hope it can stop time also
1130,i bought the apple watch ultra after watching the review while i wa in the u and found out that i can not use the cellular function wheni moved to denmark this is a huge disadvantage that you can not use the watch in another region when i called apple and asked them to help me with replacing it they declined me i think all user should be aware of this very important disadvantage
1131,mohit pandey they just sent me a link about the watch compatibility in each region so you come to know this information only if you buy the watch from another country than where you live
1132,thanks for letting u know did the apple people tell you how can we check whether a u variant apple watch cellular version is going to work in another country or not
1133,doe the apple watch ultra send first responder your live location if you go missing while snorkeling on vacation
1134,how big is your wrist
1135,get a garmin
1136,i saw another one where the guy would sleep with his watch i think it only lasted him for about a day but he did not use his phone he would use the watch for a lot of thing
1137,i have had an ultra for about 3 week now sleep with it on every night and i have never had it last le than 2 full day i also use it constantly texting calling using the workout apps so i am not sure how that guy could only get it to last a day
1138,i need some help my ultra i turn to low power mode by noon and still by 1600 i am at 20 30percent battery it not on cellular mode however i get hundred of outlook notification some advice from someone pls
1139,sound like you either have every single app running in the background constantly pinging and using up battery or you just got a bad battery in your watch i have had it for about 3 week and i have never had it last fewer than 2 full day
1140,it still look like you need to baby it when you are actually doing extreme stuff i will stick with my literally wrist saving g shock a g shock would only break after you break your own arm this is just a bigger more expensive apple watch with some extra bla bla bla on the spec list
1141,i rock climb and i have hit the face numerous time on hard rock and still do not have a scratch on it the toughness of this watch is legit unless you take a hammer to it on purpose i do not see the glass breaking
1142,personally for me series 8
1143,u lost me at 2 day 2 night
1144,while this is an impressive apple watch it a stretch to think it can compete with garmin or coros the fenix or the vertix 2 might not have all the bell and whistle of the apple watch but their reliability is something that can not be matched for people that work a guide remote emergency service or military having a watch that doe not need to be charged every few day is massive my vertix 2 only need to be charged once every two week and thats if i have used it excessively generally just using the gps for an hour each day i get around 4 week from one charge this is while it still track my sleep calorie hr exercise etc another point is durability i know my vertix 2 can be dropped 10m and all it need is a dust off and it is good to go i am not sure how the apple watch would go in my humble opinion this watch is perfect for the weekend adventurer it a great daily watch that ha some decent feature you can use in the mountain however i doubt diver mountaineer ultrarunners etc are going to replace their beloved watch with this apple watch
1145,not sure why everyone is praising the battery life i am laying in bed and it is gone down 3percent
1146,lame tech dead tech
1147,where did you get the rocket t shirt i thought it would be on the mkbhd shop but it is not there would love to get it thanks
1148,doe it work with android phone for most function
1149,it make sense because pro is beautiful while the apple watch ultra doe not look good compared to other apple watch but it is the ultimate watch imo
1150,apple fanboy
1151,can not afford
1152,thanks so much
1153,bro these cost around dollar1100 in india which is crazy expensive
1154,we are being completely ripped off in eu with apple watch ultra euros1000 also 49mm which a large black border on the screen is ridiculous it look like an 8 with a rugged metal casing ripoff alert
1155,i havent upgraded since watch 4 came out i kinda want to buy this for the gps and power saving mode my watch 4 can not handle tracking a full day of hiking also the alpine loop band is fire
1156,just wanted to say you are really good at what you do
1157,titanium can be black with dlc coating pretty sure they will make that an option once they earn a nice profit off this first release although it is a more expensive process probably looking at minimum dollar1k v dollar800 for bare titanium i have two watch with titanium with dlc they are around dollar1500 i can imagine apple charging similar price but yeah they look a lot better on the wrist and also do not chip or scratch due to dlc
1158,the problem with apple tech is it dose not matter how well you look after it apple will turn it into junk like it or not
1159,8 50 and it will be paid subscription so diver need to pay 700usd for apple watch and then 50usd a month to use it to dive thats pathetic and second thing it only up to 40 meter it stop counting beneath also lame
1160,oh dang look like you had an exposed metacarpal fracture at some point huh
1161,it just mean that the apple watch pro is still being designed mark my word the most optimal watch of all time will be called the apple watch pro give it a year or two
1162,i think it look ridiculously stupid a a result of it is massive size
1163,maybe if you have the wrist of a slender 5 0 female but it is really not that big most watch before the smart watch craze were at least a big if not bigger than this watch
1164,one of the whitest sounding black guy i have ever heard
1165,wtf
1166,nah just on look alone look ugly af
1167,the next one will have solar charging
1168,that tesla yoke look very awkward that is all
1169,it is morphing time that is the first thing that came to mind when marque turn the watch to the camera
1170,apple stole the ultra name from samsung
1171,what is practice did i see a frisbee
1172,i would get one except their calorie burn tracking is completely wrong and way way overestimate
1173,can not anodize titanium would require pvd or dlc which are both gtg
1174,probably noted already but 100m water resistance is no where near good enough to really dive watch water resistance is measured with static pressure test and doe not account for additional pressure created from movement underwater with the watch 100m is basically good enough for the pool most real dive watch begin with 300m water resistance think seiko tuna or sinn ux
1175,the effect of dynamic pressure when diving are almost zero so not a huge issue seeing a most recreational diving is within the top 40m then 100m water resistance is fine
1176,ended that day by going to sleep with about 69percent battery brief pause nice hahahahahaha
1177,hey man appreciate the time that went into creating this video i am just noticing about your comment about accidentally touching the action button when you want to grab the crown i have seen some left handed people have the crown closer to their hand feeling more confortable than away from their hand maybe this will help you
1178,tiny wrist pancake watch these millennials charging their watch almost on the daily
1179,garmin gt apple
1180,apple lead all watch sale regardless the garmin is not the same quality a this beast either
1181,you should have let them use your apple watch for testing
1182,phro
1183,so instead of one day it now work two day wow that is huge for people that spend week in the middle of nowhere seriously no one in his right mind will rely on apple watch outdoors
1184,so when you are in the middle of nowhere how do you charge your phone because if you do not rely on your phone in the middle of nowhere why would you rely on a watch
1185,i wonder how accurate that compass actually is because compass in every other apple device before is a pure gimmick it is doe not point anywhere near the north and simply put useless
1186,great golf watch too much
1187,knowing apple black will be next year upgrade
1188,no way to expensive the thing it is offering it is 400 dollar more over it is predecessor period
1189,i like that watch could probably use it due the ruggedness but it is definitely not worth the 800 dollar price tag just for that i work with metal and i am always worried i am gon na break my watch but i would rathe break the watch than my phone it is why i prefer to wear the watch when working instead of keeping my phone on me
1190,love your review dude thanks
1191,my current apple watch series 5 get me throughout the day and ha lasted through all my half marathon a long a i remember to charge it it slipped off the charger and i almost lost the the last two mile of flying pig i do have issue sometimes with gps in city like chicago and manhattan the straight line that cut thru building and road are pretty annoying and mess with the pace but apple is made gps better with each watchos iteration i guess i do not absolutely need this version of the apple watch but i do like bigger watch face and the longer battery life will be nice my next run are vega and disney so gps will not be an issue but coming from series 5 i will get vox and that metric will be neat to see i will have to check out the band on your estore
1192,i am sorry but this watch is hideous
1193,i just got my apple watch ultra 49mm titanium green alpine watch today
1194,i am a sailor and ultimate frisbee player would be cool if the watch did navigation plot a course from la to hawaii for example i would definitely get one if it did that
1195,they named it ultra because they will bring another watch with the name of ultra pro and some added feature and spec
1196,i think that apple watch ultra is not compatible with 41 nike band hat is why i will pas i do not want to be stuck with a collection of useless nike sport band
1197,just one question which pen you were using
1198,he just pulled the sickest dolphin dive i have ever seen
1199,great video like always for alpine loop are you intentionally wearing it other way around like on most apple video flat part of the band is on the upper side
1200,8 10 the reason i do not use an apple watch apple ha purposely locked a lot of feature to apple and a an android user i will not change my phone for a much more expensive one with not a much feature just because i would really like an apple watch because it seems pretty cool
1201,i have 26 watch face how can i rearrange where they are on the apple watch iphone app i do not want to scroll thru 15 face to get to the one i want
1202,marque can you please make a video when you test the apple watch in a sauna here in scandinavia we use the sauna all the time and i could not find a single video on youtube about this thank you for all your great content cheer from sweden
1203,it is apple so nope overpriced junk glad a of next year they will be forced to use usb c charger should be called the apple watch gullible a only gullible people buy them
1204,none of apple product are worth the money they selling for
1205,i love love love how big it is i am one of these guy people like to hate on for wearing the bigg as clock on his wrist one of my all time favorite go to watch is the bigg daddy by diesel watch so i am fine with the size it a win win
1206,doe the 44mm n 45mm band fit on this ultra watch
1207,that is a morpher
1208,can i dive and snorkel with this i snorke alone sometimes and if i get eaten by shark would they atleast find my arm
1209,i am tired of buying a stainless steel or titanium watch sapphire crystal that is disposable in 5 year all these premium material in a disposable watch just doe not make sense with all the genius sitting at apple they need to re engineer the apple watch where you can replace the battery easily 4 screw and replace the battery i like to argue the the apple watch is more expensive that most swiss watch if you consider you have no watch after a few year it a houdini watch now you have it next you do not why did i come to this point i have the apple watch original series this is now considered vintage by apple can not service it the battery died i paid 1 099 for it in 2015 stainless and sapphire crystal 2015 wa not so long ago in the watch world this ultra watch will not even last 10 year so is not this so expensive to own and use you will be still rocking your rolex 30 year from now the economics of apple watch is just plain bad for u perfect for apple the richest company in the world
1210,my tudor watch never dy a long a i keep wearing it
1211,your video are always great to find out new info
1212,bored
1213,maybe next year we get an iphone ultra that would be dope
1214,just want a watch to play youtube while running without lugging my iphone around
1215,why in europu shop 1020euros d
1216,this watch is definitely a necessity
1217,after going into enormous debt with at amp t to stay up with current trend i can without a doubt say that all this shit is for people that are very well off will be purchasing with cash from now on when able to
1218,i think the watch a it evolves will replace our communication quick text call via headphone device for content consumption email etc will be a smaller tablet or ultra portable in the near future
1219,i also play ultimate frisbee with an apple watch on and i am shocked how it record every single one of my practice and game
1220,i have a suunto that make this look like a childrens watch so not that big
1221,doe this have music connectivity
1222,i call it the apple watch adventure because that is what it is made for
1223,battery with lte network or wifi or any other connection may be show true battery consumption
1224,ultra sound way better
1225,one of the best product of apple in several year
1226,honestly just waiting for apple to go usb c before i leave the pixel series
1227,no
1228,garmin is still the goat when it come to smartwatch with fitness and lifestyle tracking not impressed
1229,great review thanks
1230,a lot of people are wasting their money on the high end apple watch ultra just to use it for regular use and most of the time not even exercise get what you want but i feel like it is a complete waste of money to spend dollar800 on an apple watch and not at least use it to it is fullest potential and actually get out there and explore different terrain and environment where the watch can be very useful in those situation or i guess people are just buying it for relevancy and coolness
1231,okay cool so would you mind shipping me the ultra if you do not need it
1232,it is so sad we have been trained to clap and cheer because a watch doe not need charging for 3 whole day
1233,that orange alpine loop look great
1234,is the vibration haptic alert stronger than previous model like series 4 which i can barely feel during strenuous exercise
1235,answering my own question it is stronger strong enough to feel during vigorous exercise i am also getting 4 5 day battery life the watch is the best apple watch by far 8 10
1236,battery life is not anywhere what i need and you still need an iphone impressive nevertheless
1237,thanks for the i watch review
1238,i love this
1239,samsung ha a pro watch
1240,of course it is a big nah this is not a time piece and will be worth siltch in le than a year
1241,currently have the series 7 stainless and i am always concerned about scratch and ding i do hike dive ski so this wa originally the big appeal for switching to the ultra but the idgaf factor with the titanium and flat face protected crystal is kind of my new obsession def not a watch for everyone but just like you pointed out in the video it is going to pull in a lot of the die hards that do not see value in the regular apple watch priced very well too they probably could have gone up to close to the dollar1k mark without ostracizing the target market
1242,noticed you have a tesla do you use the tesla app for apple watch if so how is it with the ultra
1243,meh
1244,i gave my last apple watch to my son because i am in that group of wanting better batter and more rugged i went back to my garmin fenix 6 with sapphire crystal i am really wanting to get the ultra now i will admit that i miss a lot of the feature on the apple watch just did not miss charging it all the time garmin get me 2 week at least
1245,i just picked up the fenix 6 sapphire on sale to replace my apple watch just for the battery life i got tired of having to pack another charger around when i travel and go hunting i wa jealous of my buddy and their garmins and never having to charge them
1246,black dlc diamond like coating would have been incredibly durable if i get back to diving i would love this watch but diving would make it even more tougher to afford
1247,i have never had an apple watch and just got my first iphone 13 pro max since the iphone 4 for me i will probably never use half the stuff that is capable in the watch but i just wanted to have the best apple watch on the market so i bought it the battery life 2k nit and aesthetic are enough for me
1248,i just received the new ultra and the size is not a surprise from a 45mm i like the overall look but the battery is what i am waiting to see if it is going to do it for me i can not wait for that software update that is suppose to add more battery life a well the durability is what got me looking at this one a well i banged up my series 7 the glass around the curve wa always taking hit i like the flat top with the protective rim of the ultra it feel heavier to me than a 45mm when i put it on i wa like ok i thought the weight wa not a thing but it is noticeable
1249,apple watch ultra battery life suck ball compared to amazfit garmin fitbit
1250,exactly my versa 3 last over a week
1251,not one smartwatch or smartphone is worth the price they are currently asking for it in germany the watch cost 1000euros worth is the maxmial 600euros also the guy who set the price for repair wa shit in the brain
1252,anodize it please
1253,6 20 100 m water resistance doe not mean it can be submerged to depth of 100 m
1254,good battery life until apple kill it next year with an update
1255,battery life is shit to begin with any other smartwatch destroys the watch ultra in battery life
1256,pip boy v 0 1
1257,w intro wow
1258,nice product from africa
1259,if you wear an apple watch you clearly have no style truly ugly design disgusting you clearly do not care about privacy you clearly do not care about data collection and you clearly do not claim about long term health care and insurance
1260,they finally made pip boy slim nice
1261,you have it on the wrong wrist
1262,id get one but i have tiny wrist and it will look like i have an ipad strapped to my wrist
1263,i am a scuba and freediver and bought this watch funny enough i crashed my motorcycle 2 day ago and the watch detected it and called the police which wa the only reason i got off the highway safely since they then escorted me off the police knew my exact location and came to the rescue i love it i love that feature and since this watch is virtually indestructible it did not even scratch crazy
1264,i do not have a digital daily driver watch i use a shearwater dive computer and a shearwater dive watch for diving but my daily driver is an omega speedmaster because i love the simplicity quality longevity and timeless design of it i realise it is comparing apple with orange but there is a watch for every person and their need want after all i have nearly always got my iphone on me so why would i buy an ultra i must be one of the people off the page thanks for the video i love your content and the way you present it
1265,curious on what your setting are to get that kind of battery life that is well beyond apple is claim of 36 hour which is what i typically get
1266,in my experience without two 3 hour workout on consecutive day i got 3 day from my first wearing of the watch with sleep monitoring turned on including the sleep focus setting charged to 100percent at about 10pm and 71 hour later at 9pm i wa at 18percent i could have gone one more sleep but then charging would have taken too long in the morning and it would not have been at 100percent before going to work i do not use the always on but i may try that to see how much of a hit it is i am at 24 hour since that second charge right now and i am at 75percent remaining so if that trend continued i could do a full 4 day down to 0percent
1267,the oceanic is a subscription well played mkbhd forgot to mention this
1268,marque make a really professional review with nice visuals and information also him 0 15 nice
1269,man how do u sleep with the watch
1270,you know that a watch is supposed to be worn on the left side
1271,say 69 take a small pause say nice continues the video
1272,for iwatch ultra with big screen it should be able to play youtube watch netflix fb instagram and internet web browser if this stuff are not added then i will not buy it until they add all this app i want on iwatch
1273,man doing any smartphone stuff on that display would be as and probably make your finger cramp up in about 30 second
1274,you wearing your watch so far back on your wrist make me uncomfortable
1275,why is not it round
1276,this apple watch is a small iphone 1
1277,the intro are so amazing
1278,i am a garmin fenix user and i laugh at this battery life i get 2 week minimum out of mine with ten of gps activity
1279,lol that thing is comically massive
1280,i am still on the series 3
1281,lol
1282,i still think apple watch is not worth it
1283,soon will be wearing forearm device think of leela on futurama she is always drawn with one just above her right wrist look even better than this boxy thing
1284,turn to the lord for he is with u repent and you shall be saved even i need to repent but god love is so un imaginable god is so so good even i need to repent but ik the lord with me and there is nothing to worry cause god truly is so so amazing praying for this and god healing comfort and return i pray that he help put thought into people head to help fine curneous for all thesis horrible deseases praying for this and healing comfort and return praying for this and god healing comfort and return pray that the lord put thought an image to help find curniouses for all these horrible disease and i praying for everyone is repentance s and share the wordbut fr screenshot and share the wird befire it too late i encourage this praying for everyone amen
1285,amen
1286,at 1 11 the airpod battery noise scared me and i had to listen again thought my airpods were dying
1287,where is your tee from
1288,oneplus pixel samsung gt apple
1289,oneplus betrayed it is fanbase
1290,why doe it not have a ultra low battery mode already
1291,they r a waste of money it is been a gimmick since the very beginning but for whatever reason if it could detect blood sugar that would be insane
1292,wow 3 day battery life and all that can be yours for dollar800 apple can go suck a lemon
1293,why do not you review a garmin watch like fenix 7 or enduro just wan na see your review
1294,i ended that day going to sleep with about 69percent battery nice
1295,thanks for the update
1296,what we only want is real men is watch to see time calendar and that is all no need bring to the table such cutting edge bullsh t watch
1297,69percent battery nice getting a thumb up just for that
1298,garmin is laughing at that battery life
1299,garmin user here when apple can reach the 2 week battery life then i can think about switching
1300,thanks for introducing me to 20syl pretty sure you used inertia for the iphone 12 video great gym song
1301,i know y all too young for this but the apple watch ultra look like the kid that used to wear the calculator watch
1302,in greece this watch ha euros1050 let that sink in i bought the m1 macbook air with le
1303,why do people continue to wear their watch on the wrong hand
1304,not sure if my comment came but try to put it again wanted to see if the dive part of the watch wa gon na be included in the review is it worth it for dive what feature doe it have for it can have the air consumption with tank air pressure with a sensor is it available doe anyone know if there is a review with a diver trying that feature of the watch
1305,marque 69 percent battery life nice lmaoooo
1306,no way did you burn 2100 calorie in 3 hour unless you are an immense athlete
1307,thanks for the review learned a lot
1308,i came for the watch i stayed for the drawing
1309,man called most middle class broke
1310,i have had mine a week really enjoy the look of it
1311,if it doe not tell time then it is definitely not worth it
1312,800 buck and you need to be in the ecosystem with all it problem no thanks
1313,whats the best bang for this watch
1314,i wa getting 3 day on my samsung galaxy watch before covid with the rotating bezel which is still the best feature for an actual watch enthusiast
1315,ultra maga my
1316,for me a watch is functional jewellery this thing are so ugly
1317,buying apple product is just a hyped up scam
1318,no it is not worth 800 but people are still going to buy it because it is an apple product sheep baaaaaah
1319,i am 100percent happy with my garmin epix 2 with awesome screen offline map and 2 week battery life
1320,good job marque
1321,i wish the ultra wa a more all around pro power user watch rather than being so heavily extreme fitness focused
1322,give me free apple watch ultra bro
1323,finger blaster
1324,thing i learnt from this video frisbee throwing is a real sport
1325,life is easy when youtube pay 1 million per month
1326,you always post a very detailed review thank you
1327,hey apple i do not care about sport diving or climbing i am a regular office worker with mostly outlook notification how about a week of battery life no thought so
1328,battery life is trash garmin 7 for me
1329,you did talk an awful lot of drivel there i did not enjoy this vid
1330,just returned mine too big for me it bothered me so much in the gym i have now bought the apple watch 8 in aluminum this doe not interfere with the exercise at all
1331,what is the song at 1 02
1332,battery still suck people will still buy this for luxury not necessity
1333,lol not paying dollar800 for a watch that is already obsolete this year i would rather buy chicken nugget for that money
1334,9 24 this watch is so huge that it gave you scoliosis
1335,2 48 that unboxing wa soo much better than i expected from apple it is nice to finally get some satisfaction from them
1336,apple care a lot about the customer experience
1337,but they already have the most satisfying unboxings i see what you were were saying it is incredible but it should not be a surprise
1338,just ordered my ultra because i currently have a series 7 small screen product red i originally got solely for working out to replace my series 3 big display but found myself hating it cause of the battery and the size wa not big enough to do anything with plus always thought the watched looked ugly regardless of the size and color and resembled a spy kid watch looking forward to the ultra and seeing if the battery life and big screen make it a good solution a far a the spy kid look i would not be wearing any apple watch to the met gala anytime soon put it that way
1339,there is a diver extension band for this too on apple is website
1340,maybe i can strap my dollar10 refub burner phone to my wrist
1341,probably just my unpopular opinion but there is no chance this watch would fit on an average woman is arm it seems heavily targeted towards men which is stupid a you are cutting that small target audience in half anyone else thinking this
1342,marque are you a lefty
1343,since io 16 siri is extremly slow and it often break the loading process thats very frustating just a quick timer take like 30 sec to load and sometimes even after that it say try again whyyyyy apple ha always worked well no matter what but now it is a slow a my old samsung galaxy s3
1344,do you think they will release one in gold
1345,nah
1346,this thing is not gon na age well lol
1347,7 47 seriously
1348,no
1349,not 90hz just be trash
1350,apple watch ultra tecnologia g shock
1351,google pixel watch or nothing
1352,get a black case oh look now it is black
1353,you said it ha air integration and then said that it doe not monitor tank pressure those are thr same thing air integration on a dive computer mean that it connects to your regulator and show you your tank pressure some dive computer take it a step farther and also metric along with that
1354,who just swap the wrist they wear a watch on you are out here just go8ng back and forth mist people just wear a watch on their nondominant hand
1355,the main reason i left behind my apple watch wa for battery life i really really liked my apple watch and what i wanted it to do i wanted it to track my sleep step and calorie i did not use most of the other stuff it could do i went over to a garmin forerunner 945 and like it too it doe a million thing i will never use but i literally get 8 10 day on a single charge i know there are a plethora of other smart watch that get 5 10 day on a single charge what the heck can not apple create a watch that doe that i am sure this new watch will get 3 5 day if you are not going crazy with every single feature for me i want sleep tracking step and track my workout that is it i might think about going back to the apple watch the ultra but 8 hundo is pretty steep my garmin wa 6 hundy which is a lot dollar200 more for the ultra it is dope though
1356,it is not shiny watch are not supposed to be tech device
1357,maybe they just want to leave the pro for later use such a apple watch ultra pro this way they can have another turn of sale
1358,are you left handed feel a little weird to see a watch on the right hand
1359,great intel thanks
1360,i wish they would make a device phone slightly bigger then the watch ultra but smaller then the i phone mini
1361,who is gon na tell him that a full apple fit and a tesla is not a real life
1362,well i am no athlete but i am excited to try the sleep tracking coming from the series 5 though what i want to ask is how low can i get the battery while keeping it in a good cycle meaning i will not destroy the future battery of the apple watch for i remember back in the series 5 or so time it wa recommended to charge your watch and not let it go under 50percent of charge so i just want to ask how low can i push the battery without destroying the future use of the apple watch for all day and all night use
1363,he just said also too sigh lol
1364,it is about 1100 usd in south africa definitely not worth it
1365,thats the only problem is that it dollar800 about double a series 7 which is what i use but do not get me wrong the feature they have added on this watch id say is like going from an iphone 8 to a 13 it a noticeable jump the added water depth is nut and given the fact it can be used a a dive computer for those scuba diver is insane but for me i do not need it if i had the money id probably buy it for the shit and giggle but do not have the money so
1366,the mic and speaker on the ultra are worse than those on the series 8
1367,you can utilize the feature of apple watch ultra if you are an athlete but man look at that it impressive especially the battery life i mostly use my apple watch to track my sleep i am not athlete nor heavy workout person but i still want that i think it is worth it to upgrade
1368,an action button that is useless offline map and turn by turn navigation are missing lack of recovery metric seriously apple who is this watch for
1369,maybe colour o can paint this thing to oppo
1370,0 17 nice
1371,i have never been a big apple fan but i do not mind the product what doe intrigue me about this watch is the feature to set unlimited gps way point but i know that this item is a high end product and it actually make good on that title nice review once again
1372,a a free diver spear fisherman i would love to try this out
1373,incoming iphone ultra
1374,i have a garmin tactix delta so i use my watch a lot more for the outdoor capability i love it i had 3 other apple watch and just not impressed soon i heard this wa coming out it definitely got my attention went to the store to try it in fell in love with it definitely can not wait to try this watch out the feature seem way better especially when i ride my motorcycle i like how ican see and talk into it
1375,tunjung utomo yes you can it come wit the charging cord with can be connected to any usb
1376,el a g itr n you would like it
1377,nomadprax i were both just both have their pro and con but i still choose the tactix
1378,trey sander can it be charged using power bank
1379,el a g itr n it is not a bad watch but personally i like the garmin tactix better i have used the ultra in the same situation i use the delta and the feature are a little better garmin is just an all around outdoor watch the ultra is not bad but i would use it if i had to the battery life between them both is just not comparable so if your planing on being out for day at a time i would not recommend the ultra i got the ultra more for when i am on my bike especially using the gps feature for when i am in the road i did test it out in the wood and it not bad just try to cary an external power supply
1380,is it me or all the top comment look like they are ai account dropped by apple
1381,i think it going to be a hit for all the people that work outside or with their hand but still want an apple watch i have a friend who is a conservation officer and another who is a mechanic and both are getting these since they will be more rugged for their physical dirty job
1382,look like you have an ipad stuck on your arm mate
1383,ill stick to my garmin battery life is much better
1384,haha battery life is the only reason i want this watch
1385,it should have the battery life at least 5 day to compete with garmin all the feature are cool but those people would not budge in 36 hour battery life
1386,why i left apple watch is because of battery life i can not enjoy wearing my apple watch for at least a week without having it charged everyday so i am currently wearing garmin tactix 7 pro ballistic it last me month or so without charging same material a the new apple watch ultra it ha more what can apple watch ultra could offer for daily and other rugged activity
1387,i promis you that watch aint a accurate a you think it is
1388,returning mine today after work gave it a 24 hour test battery wa at 50percent after one full day going back to fitbit 5 day battery huge fail for apple
1389,this wa sa helpful review but why do not reviewer cover the pairing aspect the other apple watch you needed an iphone to use it etc is this the same with this one people keep skipping over that part of thing also the network issue with passed apple watch is that the same this time is there a limit with spotify downloads and playlist like the last watch i mean comon
1390,man said 2 5 day is impressive
1391,too big
1392,i think this watch is super ugly for casual wear it look like those fake china market apple watch for hiker and outdoor people it def fill a gap
1393,ridiculous price to be honest the price is taking the piss it is not a rolex ffs
1394,not even in the same ballpark a high end watch in term of price a rolex or omega will set you back 10k compared to that the ultra is cheap
1395,battery huawei
1396,you are not supposed to actually wear a watch with a tuxedo they are called leisure suit and by not wearing a watch you are making the point that you are a man of leisure and you do not have to be anywhere on anybody else is schedule
1397,casio watch battery go 10 year
1398,do you switch wearing it left and right for a reason
1399,great review
1400,otter box is going to make a black guard for the ultra just like they did for the series 6 and 7
1401,if i can not make the interface look like the watch on goldeneye then i do not want it
1402,that is why i like the galaxy watch 4 large watch but watch shaped
1403,mr bownlee best reviewer in the business
1404,no thank you i like my swiss watch no need for the purchase of apple care to compensate for chinese junk
1405,well just to carry the watch around it probably burn about 2000 calorie daily a pandemic of tennis elbow coming soon thanks to
1406,one i will have to wait to see what watch ultra 2 brings to the table
1407,i am an apple pro everything guy i am also a watch guy omega grand seiko iwc are just to name a few that i own all are at least 44mm and round i have never owned an apple watch before because they are the ugliest smart watch on the market today so when i heard apple wa getting ready to launch a new larger rugged watch i thought finally a round apple watch will it have a black curved case with a rubber strap and rotating bezel then there it wa a cheesy looking 49mm block with a cheap looking strap basically a magnified version of all the other version that came before it what a complete disappointment apparently the word refresh doe not go very far with apple
1408,couu ali ultra for ultra marathon lmao stop making stuff up if someone want a real sport amp fitness watch they are going to buy a garmin the only people that are interested in a ultra are those with iphones and do not care about the aesthetic in a watch design
1409,ultra is for ultra marathon they want to compete against stryd run with power and polar and garmin and others
1410,it is worthless you need to have an apple phone to use it for tracking checking back your running i would not change my garmin fenix 7 for the apple garbage garmin fenix 7 give me the flexibility to use any platform of my preference
1411,i think it look like one of the first smartwatches like a mini smartphone strapped to the wrist i am an extreme sport person skydive basejump wingsuit dive freedive rock climbing etc and to me the biggest issue is the form factor entanglement and battery life there no way 2 day is enough my go to watch is a garmin descent g1 solar it look like a gshock is super durable ha gps is a full blown dive computer without subscription and ha week of battery life with solar recharging to me the apple watch ultra is like a porsche suv it for people who want to feel a if without actually needing the functionality a hiker can use the normal apple watch a runner a well a real diver not just 1 2 scuba dive occasionally per year would not trust this watch in the mountain and snow the cold will drain the battery even faster i also do not like the display bright sunlight and polarized sunglass will make it hard to read garmin us a technology where the watch becomes better readable the more sunlight reflects off the screen
1412,agree
1413,i would buy it just for the better battery life phone clarity volume and gps i do not care about anything else
1414,preordering wa a waste
1415,doe it compatible with android spasticity with fold 4
1416,pro tip use the watch on your left hand for easier use
1417,and yet still no galaxy watch 5 pro review hmmmmm
1418,i have the apple watch 2 and now i am considering a new one and not sure if this is the one my husband say that i would be ok with the 6 or 7 version need help choosing the next one thanks
1419,i just like to have the pro version of everything up until more recent i did not even own apple product i wa anti apple for year and used samsung note and samsung watch then the macbook pro released with the m1 max and i got that then the 13 pro max ipad pro then just upgraded to the 14 pro max and my ultra watch should have been here day ago but got held up in custom and transport so i am still wearing my samsung watch with my iphone for 10 month now
1420,is it just me or that watch should be on the left hand
1421,junk you have an iphone another thing ti charge stupid nice video mate
1422,only thing left is a built in solar charging option
1423,why could not they just make a alllll black one
1424,even at like dollar450 dollar500 still a maybe when you can get the old garmin fenix 6 at sub dollar500 why waste dollar on this
1425,wonder were they got the ultra from
1426,by the way your wrist is not skinny
1427,ultra is for ultra marathon they want to compete against stryd run with power and polar and garmin and others
1428,i am part of those people who are not using an apple watch because we can not afford it maybe apple can do something about that
1429,i think this watch is not enough for the price gbp800 and you get 3 day if you are lucky all the people who this product is aimed at are probably already into the garmin ecosystem and have been using watch like the fenix with 21 day battery life for year
1430,bruh do not you carry a microfibre
1431,bruh my 2 year old mi band last for 20 day apple is 2 5 day is is pretty sad
1432,damn my series 2 is starting to feel a little old
1433,a a child that wanted a casio calculator watch never got one this watch will be mine
1434,if apple watch ultra can not connect to diving equipment it is useless for proper diver and it doe not have the tech to connect to your oxygen tank to see the oxygen level remaining apple watch ultra is a luxury item with a big battery it is not for diver and with screen at max brightness it will die long before you finish a very long bicycle race for example
1435,stopped watching after run to bike transition in a triathlon
1436,maybe i missed it in a prior review but why is marque wearing it upside down the crown button is normally facing the hand for easier access and it asks during setup which wrist you will be wearing it on so it orient the face correctly
1437,best intro
1438,i have a dollar6k omega speedmaster i have to wind it it is a real watch not a gadget
1439,800 u dollar high way robbery
1440,dollar800 watch try dollar1299 in australia
1441,are you a righty or a lefty because this video is giving ambidextrous amp i need answer marque
1442,would be sweet if they added some feature for aviator i know there are apps but it would be nice to have some baked in feature for pilot
1443,who is here after tech burner apple park vlog
1444,great style in your review marque
1445,i wear an apple watch 5 45mm and i just got this and can not wait for the awesome battery life i am a woman and i like big watch
1446,like all calorie tracking device this one is wildly optimistic you are not burnimg 700 cals an hour whatever a device say for that stat divide in half
1447,i have been have trouble with the microphone on my new apple watch anyone know what to do
1448,stupid question but if this phone is for endurance athlete how would you charge your battery if you a hundred mile in the wood or on top of mount everest
1449,it amazes me how a dollar100 watch battery can last for over a week and a dollar800 watch battery can only last two day and you call that good a a matter of fact my health insurance sent me the watch for free that they paid dollar50 for
1450,i think every youtuber who review this watch forget work related activites alot of u need a durable watch when working with machinery etc and with dirty han you can not check your phone in these case this watch is a really nice thing to have
1451,yea i have been buying the stainless black watch for their durability to survive 7 day a week in a metal forming shop i got the ultra since it should be much better
1452,pro tip never use the term pro or pro tip
1453,great video a always what is your wrist size
1454,how did you get the stitch on your hand look like it must have hurt a lot
1455,their strategy for this replacing ultra watch dive computer reminds me of how they targeted expensive color correction monitor with the pro display
1456,69percent nice noice
1457,i hope apple add the db alarm to the regular apple watch
1458,now i love it even more
1459,apple iphone make watch ultra a deal breaker and google is pixel watch will make the pixel 7 pro a potential deal breaker never have i felt like i lose both way
1460,i hate apple but i have to admit this watch is very nice
1461,definitely worth more if apple didnt skip the screen notch
1462,should have called it the apple ultra maga edition
1463,did you put a screen protector on it
1464,you talk about the watch being great for people who dive run long distance and get lost in the wood but what about blue collar worker those who work 8 12 24 hr day in construction or horticulture or em fire police those that need the ruggedness because of the element they work in and maybe not so much because of the capability of the watch i would love to see apple make a watch for people who work hard labor 90percent of the time outside do you think they did with the watch ultra
1465,i would purchase it just for the size the bigger the better for me i always love big watch
1466,never knew you were a runner a well good stuff man
1467,still no alexa
1468,golf t holder 3 33 i will buy it just for that
1469,charge to go through to the metal band locking point
1470,one thing no reviewer seems to cover is the discomfort level of this watch i have worn every apple watch since apple watch 1 day and night and after wearing the ultra for 2 day and night straight the bone under my watch started to feel sore such that i had to take the watch off briefly for relief i thought i am wearing it too tight but after another day of adjustment i gave up a my wrist could no longer bear it comparing it with my apple watch 5 which i replaced i noticed the glass used for the bottom sensor is more pronounced ha more depth and roundness and literally dig into your wrist this digging into my wrist wa what wa giving me the sore bone this and the discomfort when scrubbing the crown a it wa very abrasive to my skin touching it a the crown would push the watch down every time i would turn it the crown is big ha sharp edge and pinch the top surface also ha a very edgy sharp wall around it for protection but if you have got the habit of swiping from the edge of the screen a you would on older generation your finger will swipe over the sharp edge and it is not a pleasant experience the additional weight of the watch the constant pinching soreness uncomfortable overall squareness a it sits tall on your wrist leaning on one side wa just too much to handle overall i gave up after 3 day and am returning it i can not imagine wearing this thing day in and day out including while i sleep to put thing into perspective i am an avid runner very active during the day use the watch for sleep tracking i do not have skinny wrist and have no other medical condition or allergy this wa a dream watch replacement for me until it became obvious it is not from the picture it feel the normal apple watch 8 also seems to have added an additional height to the bottom sensor which may result in similar discomfort although i am not sure a the watch itself is lighter so it may be easier to wear all the time
1471,hoping casey review this
1472,it is not just for extreme athlete alpinist and hiker it is for everyone who want to signal others they are serious about sport huge market
1473,give it 5 6 month for another boy i got ta tell u something
1474,i have my og galaxy watch and the battery last about 5 day straight
1475,i am probably considered an average user but the battery of the ultra is very appealing i use for sleep tracking for health so very appealing indeed to have a few day wear without charging is it nice looking on woman wrist too my wrist are kind of small so i worried about the aesthetic but it is very appealing especially for the charging great review thank you
1476,ste wood it is called autosleep app on watch and iphone and it is great
1477,what sleep tracker do you use
1478,guy is this only me or anyone else feel that marque is device clip are better than what company shoot love your work
1479,13 11 yes i did fall but i am ok dagnabit it finally got one right
1480,totally worth it just got mine and it is by far the best apple watch i have ever owned and i have literally owned every single one of them exception being the hermes version
1481,i feel like a watch need solar power to be called ultra
1482,we do have professional apple consumer out there
1483,doe it work with android well
1484,it is not lol
1485,with a tuxedo it is proper etiquette not to wear a watch at all
1486,i do not trust anyone that owns a tesla
1487,why doe the tech guy know what anodizing is
1488,i never owned a smart watch but i started doing crossfit and running and i am thinking about getting one but which one doe a se have enough feature for my need
1489,eddy well there are only two feature which are not important for me more on the 8 compared to the se
1490,series 8 is good
1491,i have a 7k watch on just take a few wind and i am good for 50 hour how much have you spent on your apple stuff
1492,maybe dollar7k if i add up 10 year worth of phone watch tv is and airpods weird flex though
1493,just a head up if you decide to get the cellular stainless steel series 8 it cost the same price a the ultra just get the ultra
1494,thanks this video is good but i love casio more hahah
1495,it is so wierd and kind of an expected thing seeing all these youtubers wearing an apple watch ultra just because it is the latest and the greatest and the most expensive thing apple ha to offer even if they do not need it or it wa not designed for them or for their activiites it wa the same thing with the mac pro or the expensive wheel or the airpods max they buy 1tb varient of iphone pro max every year just to switch it the next year without even using the full memory just because it is the top of the line model they want to get it and show it off it never help a regular viewer or the regular customer in any way most of the people can not afford such thing and will not be bothered for their everyday use review
1496,got to be the most useless device that is pare to a phone no matter how you spin it
1497,i would say i am an apple pro
1498,verdict worth it for those who can afford it
1499,they should make it kinetic charge especially if it is for sport and fitness ijs
1500,people are watching you also outside of u why do you never cover eu uk price
1501,brilliant review thank you
1502,circle
1503,marque is not a fan of fingerprint magnet surprised he did not wipe while filming great vid a always
1504,oh no mom nurse in me concerned about long laceration stitch on marque hand look fairly recent watch vid tho very cool
1505,let is be real with ourselves this will be worn by most people who do not do anything ultra except going to pick up drug and a mcdonalds run i am not mad at all with the watch nice looking bit of tech and wicked design
1506,such an informative video i am genuinely shocked
1507,fnck that sh t get a life people
1508,good lord that thing is a huge brick apple watch were not the sweetest of watch but this time apple pushed it too far
1509,3 day huawei watch 14 day full rough usage day in and day out well i think apple need to learn more
1510,it is too much for you you can not handle it please go and use it for at least a 70 3 ironman and enough of the sleep tracking else just stick to the non ultra version if you please
1511,15 min video 3 non skipped ad in between video this is where we are heading now
1512,so basically it ha the amount of battery life a normal apple watch should already have lol
1513,wish you would talked about how they need to add these feature to a regular series watch and not pigeon holing people into buying the pro max or ultra model because apple arbitrarily made some feature exclusive to that model
1514,i have been using the ultra with work currently for the past 2 day the size is nothing to me since i am accustomed to dive watch i wa shocked how light it is in the past 48 hour the watch currently sits at 48percent i check my watch on occasion checking in with physician i work with utilizing the timer for 10 hr a day when i work a a phlebotomist on site and texting i suspect i will be charging this on the 3rd day but the screen size make visualizing all text easier on the eye i am hiking this weekend and i am very excited to utilize the wayfinder and backtracking i will be traveling to surf spot in a couple of month and indulged in diving soon that will be fun to explore i am not an extreme athlete but the new feature and the price point being cheaper then the ceramic watch a few year i am happy
1515,are you going to pay for the dive computer
1516,those intro never feel bored hat off to the mkbhd editor
1517,apple zombie are easy to fool
1518,i wish the button were black or titanium instead of hard stuck orange can not dress it up at all
1519,well marque i am one of those people on the outside that have never used apple and the reason why is mostly price their product cost a lot but i am watching your review and thinking of what it would be like to be part of the apple ecosystem but before i get ahead of myself i am a big fan of foldable phone and apple doe not make one yet but we will have to see anyway thanks man for your review stay up
1520,im returning my se 2 for an ultra i do lot of activity outside and workout 5 day a week i feel like ultra is win for me and it different compared to other watch the battery life got my attention
1521,maybe it is just not convenient for enough people but i use my galaxy watch for week to well over a month without charging becasue i put in on battery only mode when i am not in need of additional feature of course charging is not really an issue either unless you are sleep tracking but it is just one of those thing that i do not understand how the battery life is an inconvenience there are plenty of time during the day when you can charge it up while doing something else
1522,i am confused you are promoting your watch band for apple watch but you do not have any for the ultra lol
1523,i really want this new watch but i can not wear a watch when doing brazilian jiu jitsu
1524,a lot can be said for the protected screen edge for mechanical work
1525,i wonder about pilot an e6b would be nice
1526,the apple watch ultra is awesome but this video is superb and excellently made
1527,i did not know this exsited
1528,daaaaamn
1529,how are you comparing it with a casio watch which is devoid of 90percent feature on the apple watch wtf lol
1530,wish i had dollar800 to get one but with dollar800 i can pay my rent for a month
1531,iqoo messed up all
1532,imagine paying 1000dollar because you are too lazy to do all those from phone
1533,dollar1000 is not much
1534,i am really interested in this watch because of the longer battery life the compass and the red light filter while i understand that battery life is pretty limited on the normal apple watch i find that the compass app and the filter are thing they definitely could add i am not into any extreme sport though so i can not justify buying an apple watch ultra
1535,that watch look thiccer than a bowl of oatmeal
1536,ultra extreme the name is game and instantly conveys the idea of hardcore mission
1537,how about you do not film while driving so you can focus on your actual driving tesla or not it is not smart
1538,burn cals with frisbee
1539,why did not they make it not look absolutely horrible
1540,i am an apple watch se user and i am happy with it just using it for notification and extra control for music
1541,a a person that work in a metal shop the durability wa a big sell
1542,a stellar review
1543,apple is favorite user
1544,a a deep diver i just need it instead of my dive computer it would be really great
1545,no it is not worth it the only way it will be is if you buy it and put it away for 25 year
1546,in europe 1000euros
1547,if your wrist is big enough and your pocket are deep enough
1548,enduro 2 yeahhh
1549,seeing a watch on the left wrist eh
1550,i do not have it cause it doe not exist
1551,please come back in a month a let u now how the battery is holding i love my apple watch but it seems that everytime i get a new one the battery is good for only like a month and then i have to charge it every night
1552,will it work with garmin i am a cyclist and i am tired of my hr band and wonder would this work
1553,seems like you are using your age a an excuse
1554,a an adult film star this watch is perfect i shoot for 8 12 hour a day of nonstop action and it is for the most part my workout for the day i love being able to keep track of my heart rate calorie burned and recovery for long day on end
1555,wait for gen 2 trust me
1556,where did u got your black band from
1557,i get 10 12 day of battery with my garmin fenix how are wearable user still putting up with daily charging
1558,i have a weird question how comfortable to wear this watch while sleep i have been wearing apple watch to monitor my sleep quality for a long time and it is kinda important to me so curious to see your thought
1559,smart people do not need a watch
1560,hey marcus i heard it is ok to say the word ugly
1561,another thought almost everything out there ha a blacked out version shoe clothing car motorcycle everything why are not these manufacturer coming out with a blacked out version of their stuff it is an entire market that ha existed for the last 5 to 7 year and they are not even paying attention
1562,i do not know folk this watch with it three specific band and color combination look to me to be very minimal viable product i see more color and combination coming out so if you do not like the look of this very ugly color combination i am pretty sure somethings going to come out here soon
1563,0 15
1564,the day my smartwatch only ha 3 day of battery life remaining is the day i throw it out
1565,for me the watch is an absolute win because of diving however i still got to see some real world review for this also my regular apple watch doe not work that great underwater so i am curious how it is gon na be with this one
1566,1000euros in europe
1567,a a
1568,mini pip boy
1569,mini pip boy
1570,you still missing the pilot people just like the garmin watch are dominating the air
1571,being able to monitor tank pressure is a very basic thing for even recreational diver a this is one of the biggest safety issue do not think is a technical diver issue so until this integration is there where ultra can speak to pressure monitor will not be used by anybody apart from occasional diver will still buy one but not for dive computer
1572,compared to last year is dollar800 titanium cased watch 7 at least this one ha all sort of new feature and a new utilitarian look
1573,a a motorcycle rider the apple watch is such a pain in the a the battery life is so bad and you always have to take the charging cable with you i wish there would be an apple watch that last 5 day which is great for a nice motorcycle trip or work week i wa really looking forward for the ultra but now i will look for an alternative
1574,it far closer to a real watch apple ha gone i will stick to an se a a daily driver and my ridiculous ancient dumb watch for formal setting
1575,why can not these thingies be solar recharged powered
1576,nice to hear 20syl voice again a the intro music
1577,800 dollar are they mad
1578,hmmm i do not entirely agree with your theory i do not think it would make sense for apple to build a premium watch at a relative low price point to attract a minority group of professional athlete and adventurist is i am not sure if the ultra is the right watch for them this move i think is to go after the large market of sport watch fan bringing an attractive product at low price point doing so they will push garmin to the upper market segment eventually if garmin is playing the wrong card to a niche market smart move from apple but not sure if i like it a a consumer
1579,thanks for good review like you said 2 3 day of battery life is nothing for a outdoor action watch i just do not know why apple do not make solar apple watch so you can be in the jungle camping for week without electricity can wait for that day
1580,man i have a gen 2 that is limping and i wish i could get my hand on this apple say it will not ship to me until november
1581,you do not burn 2k cals at a practice the average person burn about 100 calorie per mile ran you run a marathon you are burning about 2600 calorie to put that into perspective tracker are always highly incorrect with calorie burned
1582,fyi titanium can be hard black anodized i have had it done regularly in my own work
1583,mark as brownlee
1584,my fitbit last a week
1585,disappointing for price no built in navigation map like the garmin watch which do not require a cell signal or data to update and have 16 day battery life so ultra not a useful for serious hiker or pro outdoor type
1586,if this can actually replace my suunto dive computer i will buy it for 800 question is will it tho
1587,what about reviewing the galaxy watch 5 pro
1588,bought the apple watch 6 in 2021 battery is still good i like the watch but i would not buy another one
1589,just noticed that you have the same scar a me on the right hand
1590,i think it is biggest money waste
1591,there is no way you burn 2k calorie in any sport that tracking is not accurate at all
1592,i still do not think smart watch offer enough for me to no longer see them a a fad it is not become necessity level yet like smartphones maybe the day will come when they are no longer gimmicky to me
1593,were you using it on both hand
1594,maybe they wan na make a pro better with advanced technology
1595,apple watch basically released a pipboy
1596,i miss pebble
1597,first few line i wa like mehn we finally got a day in the life vid a while later i wa like yh missed a few big it is enough
1598,maximum will be the new pro after ultra mark my word
1599,it is a great watch with good battery life that doe not feel heavy or too big on my wrist i never got a smartwatch and waited year for apple to come out with a watch like this because others apple built look like toy this look more like a real watch and the new function make it pay for itself a a dive computer is pretty expensive too i wa not sure in the beginning and my girlfriend hated the idea of a smartwatch but already after a few day we both think that it is a pretty cool device
1600,omg that thing is ugly af
1601,this method work perfectly thanks for sharing
1602,holding off for the version with glucose monitoring i could gift that to so many people
1603,manufacturing cost y pricey
1604,i just need the regular apple watch
1605,insert garmin fenix meme adventurer biker mountaineer military garmin ha gps map 2 week battery life up to infinite if you get solar if you ask any military person garmin fenix is the only watch they recommend if it lasted 1 week and did not have an orange button then maybe otherwise for that price point you will get more from the last gen fenix than an apple watch
1606,for that price i will ride with garmin forerunner 945 battery last me minimum two week putting in work with it apple been playing catch up if you ask me maybe for a inside gym quick session and going out for look yea but not for all the way outdoor fully activity like they make it seem garmin the goat of that
1607,a a very large man tall big hand this might be the apple watch that get me to buy
1608,it is so overkill that i would feel bad buy it
1609,this is on the apple store too
1610,i am with kevin o leary on this subject i think it is for commoner and when you walk in a room wearing one it scream i am 20percent off retail for the same amount of money you could buy a nice hamilton that will hold it value longer than these tech heap will i think smart watch are tacky and scream i am a broke commoner
1611,casio pro trek is my tried and true watch currently i have my apple watch 7 which is my fitness amp daily driver and the timex expedition which charge via solar but no gps or receiver and use when i am at work rugged outdoors or even diving for me it boil down to how much tech do i need for the moment i am excited to eventually get the ultra and test it myself still got to keep my casio though it is been through alot and still work
1612,p w if all you need is reliability toughness longevity and a bit of abc alti baro compass the casio pro trek solar will not disappoint you i have been using it for year when i am outdoors alongside a series of huawei smartwatches for everything else admittedly this apple watch ultra get me on the fence seeing if there is one watch which could do it all
1613,g t damn what is the model i will never wear an apple watch because i do not need that kind of analytic over my daily life anything on my wrist i want durability reliability and low maintenance i find having to charge a watch or being aware of it is power level every 2 3 day to be a tedious task i will save for my phone and that alone this casio pro trek sound like a winner in my eye i have a couple titanium sapphire solar watch myself one being a casio and they are always my go to v the mechanical watch i wear only for vanity sake
1614,buy a garmin gps watch instead of apple watch
1615,gah dayum
1616,i ended the day with 69percent battery nice hahaha i see what you did there
1617,you are a clown bro this is bad for athlete and way too expensive garmin 955 better than this garbage all day
1618,battery life is pretty shit
1619,lol i will stick with garmin 17 day of battery
1620,we never got the samsung galaxy watch5 video
1621,ultrarunner here this will not cut it for most of u
1622,i would like to use this to track my fitness during football
1623,doe the apple watch show on screen when your iphone which is paired to is unlocked
1624,burning 2000 calorie with walking and minimal aerobic excercise is absolutely wrong by around 7 11 fold
1625,69percent battery nice lmao
1626,still not a garmin
1627,i hate the way this product in particular ha been unashamedly fragmented by apple do we really need a new one every year and they expect you to not have any fomo but on the other er hand the competition is so far behind that it may a well not exist
1628,garmin gps watch set the bar higher sorry apple
1629,im going to get the ultra but what 800dollar in my country it is 999euros so 1000euros
1630,i would say you get the same value with fitbit charge 5
1631,my god i hate that steering wheel
1632,lol computer on a wrist maybe we will live to see apple pip boy in the future just like the fallout game
1633,i want the ultra to replace my series 7 because of the screen size and flatness and battery life and i do not do any of those other recreational activity
1634,there are better and cheaper smartwatches other than this i am sure people buy this just to show other people that they can afford it
1635,at this point you are becoming a robot pal i am telling you you are far away from reality and the real world go back to mechanical stuff drive a 1972 cadillac with a 472 ci
1636,the problem with this ultra watch is the close source that will not let your trainer set you up on a training program because apple doe not let 3rd source app for training you will find it to be a more fashion or wannabe enthusiast one day a month work out folk wearing these not really the athlete
1637,that intro with the green icon and also a green light in the actual watch wa so pleasing
1638,the random god damn audio insert at 0 10 absolutely sent me lmfao
1639,can you please make a video about apple care and your opinion about the service
1640,you can not pack all the pro feature to one device this size they did make all of them just enough it feel like but i still would get device made specifically for the thing i am doing rather than a watch with 10 000 different feature professional deep diver will not use the ultra since it cap out at 40m 130ft professional hiker could use it but a garmin watch for example a garmin fenix 7x sapphire solar that ha the necessary feature for hiking not a smart watch tho with 28 day of battery life the ultra matron people will definitely not choose a apple watch because of comfort garmin ha the forerunner series for that a an armature athlete i use a garmin forerunner 245 music while a professional friend of mine us a 945 music both with 10 day of battery life
1641,ben10 watch
1642,800dollar to have 5g on your skin all day no thanks i enjoy living
1643,hey marque what is that laptop you are furiously typing away on 10 34 it look sleek
1644,i work in the construction field and a couple year ago i bought the apple watch i think the series 4 and within a week it wa all scratched up now the ultra with the sapphire crystal would be a game changer for me because it is way more scratch resistant and also the battery life of course
1645,never heard of a prosumers marque
1646,exactly me having bit skiny hand and a much a i love all the feature except it look like computer on hand way bigger for me
1647,sir please give watch my dream please give me sir
1648,i am still waiting for a watch shape that is the only reason so i am still on the outside
1649,comparing the battery life of a smart watch with a conventional watch make no sense they are two completely different gadget
1650,12 56 to 13 00 is an underappreciated shot
1651,these 69 420 joke got to stop
1652,so talking video game i am here me the life form
1653,69percent battery nay
1654,great review but i think you are missing a massive subset of potential user people who need a simple rugged watch with increased battery life such a police fire and em the apple watch failed in two aspect prior it wa not rugged enough for job that require a more physical nature and the battery life required to frequent charging given some occupation is shift some firefighter and em work 48hr shift a typical apple watch would not make it through one complete shift on a single charge but taking the watch off at night to charge it would not be feasible the ultra is the first apple watch that is on the job compliant in that it can last an entire shift plus is hearty enough to take the daily physical abuse running an ultra marathon or scuba diving is a niche market that is over glamorized for apple is marketing making a watch that police fire em can wear now that is breaking into an untapped market
1655,these intro video animation are tooo sicccckkk
1656,try a dress watch for a tux
1657,can not believe that thing we watched in sci fifilms a kid are now commercial feature in cell phone in our lifetime i wonder what is coming in the next 10 year
1658,why you wear your watch on your right hand who doe that dude
1659,a pro is a bourgeoisie
1660,the thing that all gadget reviewer totally miss is that apple are considering it watch for the watch enthusiast too how many people that buy a rolex deep sea or submariner do you think use that for diving or sport pretty much zero customer for premium tool watch do not use them a tool the ultra is an excellent tool watch but considering how well it is designed and how considered everything from material to ui to watch band is this is a watch enthusiast watch it is jewellery therefore the whole take with the drawing i think miss the mark this is a watch not a gadget like an iphone
1661,yo is that mkbhd crouching on my crop martha look at this some farmer probably
1662,you forget about the cycling crowd battery life is still barely enough and no ant support or able to connect ble sensor for very important thing like watt meter heart rate band to get accurate reading cadence and so on
1663,iphone ultra when
1664,a a blah blah blah i blah blahhh how about that even a a lover of tech this shit is way too expensive
1665,the apple watch ultra reminds me of the old samsung galaxy active phone with the active button on the side you could pretty much do everything with it just a more compact version on your wrist
1666,i might get it because im a scuba diver and it an act a a dive computer
1667,marque u r so great guy stay healthy
1668,there is no way an athlete would buy this over a garmin
1669,just wait til apple come out with the pip boy then we will talk large hehe
1670,dumbest logic comparing apple watch to regular watch and to diving gear lol
1671,how accurate are these calorie spent number i sometimes play tennis with my apple watch it get me crazy number such a 900 1 000 calorie burn per hour that is insane i play at a higher amateur level but that must be wrong
1672,sick intro love the work by the team
1673,would you expect the iphone ultra down the road a the active line of apple expands
1674,i hate apple but this look amazing diehard android user wishing he could change
1675,i have never had such a deep appreciation for something i know i do not need such thorough objectivity make for great personal counsel
1676,you are missing more ring in your diagram ultra watch is for amateur athlete i mean that in a positive sense outside of them you get the pro am athlete then the pro athlete and then tactical athlete apple is marketing to the pro am and higher with a watch only suited to the amateur athlete they missed the mark by taking a watch that is great for runner cyclist and triathletes and trying to market it like it is useful or useable for mountaineering expedition and ultra running which it most definitely is not
1677,one thing apple ha done is to open door for new technology and idea but a a young african technologist i think the most important breakthrough they can make is being able to allow wireless simultaneous charging which allows user to simultaneously gadget for example when charging iphone user get to connect to the desired gadget either airpods or apple watch to charge simultaneously through the iphone
1678,way too big look ridiculous on your wrist
1679,why do you always talk about apple product time to unsubscribe
1680,i like mkbhd video and love the production quality especially after they have the studio this however is the first video that i feel compelled to write the background is off the stacked cardboard box are a distraction and could have been done better my 2p of course and no i am not a designer
1681,my man flashing his boxer fracture like me lol
1682,not sure how i have missed your video in the past but loved this and have liked and subscribed
1683,i have always liked the apple watch however i am a purist when it come to my watch so i do not own one nor do i ever think i would for style alone it will never be a replacement for a standard mechanical watch which never requires charging
1684,compared to a titanium seiko breitling or rolex it is a bargain so many feature for pocket money compared to the big brand
1685,the lack of color is another ploy for them to add it to the next new update ya know it is coming for next year
1686,i belive apple pay you very god to play them game evething from aple is about money
1687,that is because you are using it on the wrong wrist lol
1688,i still think for hiking other outdoor activity and battery life the garmin fenix 7 7 7x is the way to go my fenix 7x with everything turned always on display except the 5 satellite my battery last 3 week if you turn every extra stuff off then the battery last 1 year if i have the 5 satellite turned on for hiking and other activity then the battery last 48 hour the garmin map and tracking are superior for hiking and ultra marathon most people do not know about the garmin fenix and epic watch you should check them out
1689,hi marque will you be doing a series 8 review aswell
1690,the video ha no music that is good
1691,are you ever going to use all the functionality how long i am suppose to wait for the watch to be fully charge
1692,69percent battery nice i like that this ha like become the standard thing to say after the number 69
1693,can not wait to get the watch
1694,it is 999 euro in europe
1695,that battery should last a month my casio battery last for 10 year my kindle last for a month no way a 2022 model of a smart watch should not last at least a week with modern battery technology fail by apple imho
1696,marque the watch doe not look a big a it seems on your wrist look in a mirror with your watch hand in front of your body palm towards your belly and you will see what other people see when they look at your watch arm
1697,i get mine friday and excited to get the oceanic app for scuba diving i am also a mt biker and looking forward to using the waypoints when i go exploring so a not to get lost
1698,waste of money
1699,try the huawei gt runner
1700,some company should do an apple watch band with small solar panel on it kinda crazy idea and probably expensive but
1701,look like a toy you can open it up for some chewgum can not believe anyone would chose this abomination over a similar priced garmin tactix delta or 7
1702,what about apple user that just want to appear wealthy and popular
1703,just realised that the youtube app is now matching the colour of the area surrounding the video to the colour present in the video maybe i am super late but nice little touch
1704,marque i have gained a lot of very valuable information from you in the past and it is the same for this review so thank you i will say however a an avid skier xc triathlete and backcountry hiker this watch doe not quite do it i did not see in your review if it could download a gpx file for you to follow with turn by turn guidance the battery a you said is very short when compared to other adventure watch for reference i work out every day for at least an hour running gravel biking mountain biking swimming and many hour on weekend my garmin 945 last more than a week with all of that activity i do not think the ultra can monitor power which is a key cycling metric which triathletes track the only thing that i really wish my watch did that the ultra doe is allow me to respond to text message if i had a non iphone actually it would but unfortunately apple just doe not support other brand communicating with it device very well at all
1705,i am not sure i agree with calling the ultra a pro model watch the ultra is a watch designed for outdoor activity in mind while pro model are meant to be the premium in build and feature but are not outdoors focused an apple watch pro would be more fitting of a series 8 in a titanium or steel body maybe we will see the ultra line expand in the future
1706,sold for a surfcaster fisherman like me this is essential
1707,honestly extreme watch doe not make much sense if come w o garmin like solar powered battery
1708,bling bling watch real runner for instance will use a garmin fenix 6 much more interesting that is the reality i personally run 5 time a week i will never buy this apple watch to replace my garmin
1709,the quality of these video are insane i feel like i am watching an apple showcase you even go on a trail just to show one of the feature insane dedication love u mkbhd
1710,too much white supremacy in his video for my taste
1711,i saw a interview where he mentioned that one of the camera he us for his video cost him 35k and that is just 1 so yeah his video are top quality
1712,thanks
1713,sponsored by you too naive
1714,i liked the sudden frisbee catch
1715,800 buck what a great deal huge and really nerdy
1716,garmen battery still last waaaaaay longer
1717,i have an apple watch series 1 never buy another apple watch again
1718,apple should make a camera build in apple watch on the side of the watch people who like taking pic should be better
1719,my biggest watch face is 46mm
1720,hey man what color do the ultra come in
1721,apple watch should change the square face sam sung watch is better is circle watch
1722,that subtle nice
1723,can you make a video desk tour 2022
1724,im sold just because the full keyboard
1725,no black no buy for me
1726,am too broke to afford this am definitely not the target market
1727,technology is evolving my friend
1728,it look like a amazing
1729,i did not know that jidion ha a tech channel
1730,cringe
1731,it is called the apple watch ultra and not pro because the word ultra mean beyond it take you beyond
1732,hearing voice by 20syl come up and knowing that there will be an epic intro sequence is just so you keep up the great work marque and co
1733,do you need an iphone to use apple watch
1734,it is finally big enough that i can think about getting one
1735,they are tying to make samsung mad i would not be surprised if samsung came out with a samsung pro
1736,bro tell u how to off auto enhancement on iphone 13 i did many thing like off the hdr mode and on the burst mode
1737,marque there are screen protector for the ultra that actually cover the whole watch and you can get them in color like black
1738,11 00 honestly not utilizing the built in accelerometer to recuperate power to the battery like an automatic mechanical wristwatch wa a real waste maybe it is technically not doable or maybe i am just an engineering idiot i do not know enlighten me
1739,4m view but yet you fail to mention the ultra doe not have edge to edge display what a step backwards who care about a 49mm screen if the display is only 47mm with an unusable black bezel around the display how irresponsible of apple to fail to mention this going right back they are not getting my dollar800 to downgrade
1740,apple just need to add a proper golf app to the option
1741,great video tank pressure monitoring is not really extreme actually but quite widely available and cool in recreational diving i love that feature in my suunto vyper i hope apple will find a way to include that feature but it doe require integration with a separate antenna or apple to sign deal with 3rd party
1742,my thought too when they showed off the dive feature i got really excited and the moment it ended without show anything about pressure monitoring i felt pretty deflated i want to replace my s5 with a new apple watch and thought that the dive computer might be enough to push me to upgrade now but there is no way i would upgrade for that price without pressure monitoring because then i just will not use it for diving anyway
1743,are you going to review the galaxy watch 4 pro aswell
1744,the worst thing about apple watch for an international traveller is that the cellular is not compatible across the world like an iphone because of the band it is possibe technically for apple to build a wacth that work internationally for cellular service

1779,none of the apple watch feature are necessity i wa intrigued i bought it and now i am wearing it it is just too expensive to stay in my drawer newer buying it again because there is no use case for it even the step tracking feature now build into an iphone but for now i will wear all my money out of it 4 year anniversary with my apple watch 4
1780,69percent battery nice that made me laugh more than it should have
1781,i just need the battery from that watch and insert it onto my series 2 i would be so happy
1782,do these watch have voice recorder a well i need for school lecturer and also to record bully
1783,marque flexing on u with that highlight
1784,middle of nowhere walmart parking lot
1785,i swear all they are doing is trying to get u to wear amp use thing that allow them to track u amp now monitor our health 24 7 this is all about data tracking amp the selling of it to people we really do not want getting their hand on it we are paying for it amp could not be happier to do it no turning back now
1786,dollar800 00 without vaseline well if you buy it you will be supporting the fleecing of america the phone have been over the top for delivery now a watch too bend over sucker
1787,never been into apple is watch but this i totally dig i guess because of how big and rugged it look but at that cost nah
1788,how did the nike band fit on the watch
1789,the battery life is a joke outside of isheeps
1790,i thought you would want to keep it charged above 70percent at all time
1791,the gps and battery life 2 plus day like you said new daily but not for dress up
1792,unless is made of gold it ai not worth it
1793,hmm seeing this make me want to finally upgrade from my series 1
1794,what are those overkill feature you mentioned i see none
1795,i like how you included your dive frisbee catch nice flex
1796,whoopy so it is 36 hour battery compare that to garmin month long battery just in case it is needed for a mountain climb v the fake adventurer is that may think this will be there to save them when it will not
1797,i just got mine on release day and love it so far great info on the battery optimization yet to release
1798,calling b on that frisbee calorie burn
1799,800 buck no way traditional watch like a citizen all day long
1800,the animation you put on your video are gorgeous and amaze me
1801,a awesome video
1802,apple is like costco you go there to see what they you think you need
1803,i am very interested to see how well the battery hold up long term my series 4 apple watch barely last a full day now but when i got it it would last a day and a half with my usage great video marque
1804,damn nice catch on the frisbee not sure i will need an ultra will skip it for the next one
1805,i think that this worth it for select individual for example i a diver am planning to get one of these just for the dive computer capability usually dive computer are incredibly clunky and an upper range one is around the same price a the ultra even if you are getting it just a a dive computer it is worth it that is exactly the point though it is worth it a a dive computer but for a casual user person the extra 400 is not really going anywhere it fully depends on your situation and usecase
1806,bro the quality of this video is outstanding it almost feel like a commercial good job man
1807,bullshit the watch should last atleast a week apple can do it but will not do it right away
1808,dollar800 seems a lot for a watch but then again dollar800 is not too much for a watch if you are looking outside the budget or entry level analog watch i have owned the huawei watch and galaxy watch and from what i have seen i think apple is watch are a far better implementation v wearos with tizen being a bit better than wearos in my time using my smartwatches extended battery life is certainly a plus since it feel like everything need charging nowadays ultimately i just went back to my citizen promaster sst which charge via sunlight no smart feature but enough for me personally
1809,watching how you hold your steering wheel yoke look so uncomfortable
1810,catching up with the pebble a few more generation and it will be just a good maybe
1811,nice vid but can we talk about those sick edits at the beginning
1812,the new watch ha a better presentation than the new iphone 2 day of battery life is sad when huawei best watch ha a 14 day battery life with all the same feature a this new watch
1813,could be fun to use a a pocket watch
1814,people asking me why i am not buying an apple product i told them because i am not idiot
1815,not too bad but imma keep my oneplus cobalt watch seeing a it doe everything i need it to and it can last 10 to 12 day dependant on heavy usage
1816,almost all of the population doe not need any kind of smart watch
1817,apple pro hustler d save that dolla
1818,two day and two night dude been reading the bible
1819,what is that scar how did you get it
1820,this watch cost more than the original iphone
1821,let meet please how long are you in nyc for
1822,my biggest question is what do you drive that is not a steering wheel
1823,it is a tesla i do not know which one but one of the newer one
1824,what about the battery health kind of like on how iphone you are able to see if it is healthy or if it is time to be replaced that is what i want on android instead of guessing when you need a new battery it will just tell you the battery health of the matter i want to see that in the android please make it happen
1825,what doe mkbhd stand for
1826,apple is worth nothing double any spec from apple lower the price by half and you will get huawei good luck burning money with apple and tesla
1827,off topic but that catch wa sick
1828,a a heavy equipment operator mtb biker crossfitter occasional bodyguard whose starting to dabble in camping and hiking this is what i wa looking for in previous model weather it wa climbing in and out of equipment trying to hear phone call over the equipment banging the screen on weight and bar inadvertently falling off my bike on trail taking down crazy fan or attacker who rush the client well done apple well done cue standing ovation
1829,0 08 1 800 calorie that is absolutely nothing
1830,another useless gadget maybe
1831,i fault your logic that only a fraction of watch user want the feature you are most excited about battery life i would argue that every single watch user would appreciate having that same battery life i think every user can take advantage of longer battery life not just pro user apple just chooses to charge a premium for basic feature that should be free i also think any user would appreciate ruggedness think your average high school or college student imho it is a rip off if you consider the dollar450 competing delivers pretty much all of those at half the price
1832,can you do a review on the latest garmin smart watch
1833,whatever info i know about tech come from you i love watching this channel the only thing i want is to work with you when i grow up
1834,marque is review are getting kinda lame recently in term of verdict
1835,until they do not make it solar and black i will not buy
1836,nah you would be healthier without it
1837,graphic are amazing
1838,earned your like already 20 second in
1839,nah
1840,you forgot about the group of people who do not do any of those thing and just buy the most expensive thing apple offer for drip point or whatever
1841,i am wondering how much it cost to replace the screen and whatnot i am getting the watch and want to skateboard in it if it break i hope i can replace the part for a reasonable price
1842,if we are honest this is the range rover of watch a very small fraction of the people that will buy this will use any of the extreme sport feature and even those that do will be exactly like yourself weekend warrior not professional diver or alpinist i expect those extreme sport activity occur over many week or month most extreme sport athlete i expect use a heart rate chest strap a it is much more accurate than a wrist based one the super vibrant color screen kill battery life that is why the high end garmen watch are black and white which doe not sacrifice function over form also the ergonomics of the watch are laughable at best they really need to work on their hardware instead of software but most tech company are not good at that which is why tesla remains one of the most unreliable vehicle on the planet this is a classic apple money grab plain and simple and those that do not see it are probably just apple fan boy
1843,hilariously big based on how it look on mkbhd is wrist i am gon na pas
1844,32gb ram on a watch can we game on it haha
1845,only if it is girl value i like old school bike for 800 and then in 3 year it is about dollar5 000
1846,for the record the old samsung watch got two full day and two full night that actually last like 4 day just sitting there but if are doing a lot of thing with it then no last two and a half full day also the screen is really bright a a matter of fact is brighter than that but i feel like he ha to say those thing
1847,honestly the apple watch look like those cheap as watch used to get back in the day a a kid that only cost dollar1 or dollar0 25 it is not a good look it doe not look impressive however that samsung watch doe look impressive i am not just saying that because i am a samsung person i do like apple and i like this watch however the look is terrible and they should really stop going for that look it look like cheap watch whenever i see people with those watch i remembered the cheap costing watch you find at the 99 cent store or even a dollar general at least samsung ha the look that everybody want when it come to watch for example if you go to a swap meet and get a cheap dollar20 watch you could guarantee that that look more impressive than the iwatch they have color that you want metal and more metal and they look premium there is no freaking way that if anybody saw those watch they would think you had a lot of money whenever you see it i watch from a distance it look like a cheap costing material when all the kid would know their eye watch but you are 27 then you know it is that s look like a f piece of crap watch that you get a 99 cent store
1848,you are missing another group i just like fancy stuff hah i wa looking for a reason to upgrade and more durable bigger battery and new party trick wa just what i needed
1849,i consider myself a pro but gave the pro airpods to my wife and got the new regular airpods when they released i do not regret it at all since i do not like it when they go all the way in your ear bosse still ha the best design with the inner lip for comfortability
1850,i think the idea behind the pro is because this actually is not a pro watch the stainless is the same watch but more luxury same price i do not think they want people confusing the titanium with better when it is just designed towards active people with certain need whereas if you want those feature but you are a guy who is closing acquisition or something there is the stainless
1851,not bad although my garmin fenix 6x pro solar still get about 22 day of battery life it track my workout 6 day a week my sleep every day us gps on my run ha actual map is far more resilient more water resistant more shock resistant more everything resistant and the new one have even more battery life and the tactic version is infrared or night vision compatible apple make a nice watch but they will never come close to garmin
1852,they will not come close to garmin until they change their screen technology oled or whatever it us eats too much battery that is what i have heard at least love my garmin
1853,i have been waiting on a smartwatch to be able to be completely independent or i can make phone call and text and hail a uber or lyft from my wrist i want to get away from having a physical phone if i could do everything from an apple watch that is what i am looking for now if i need to browse the web and whatnot i would have a tablet if i need to take picture to i would go back and get a actual camera but to do everything else that would be cool to not have a physical phone on me and do all the thing i could do on my wrist
1854,what the heck is that on your shirt
1855,the space x shirt
1856,what about the ppl that just want crazy battery life lmao
1857,dude let me download wtf mkbhd disappointed in you i live in a country where internet access is not always available
1858,calorie count on the apple watch and many other device are generally overstated by about 50percent i have tested this many time in many way and when i am calorie counting i multiply the amount on my apple watch by about 6 at the end of a workout to give myself a picture of what i probably burned for example i estimate that at my age and weight i burn 500 calorie for an hour of intense cardio sweating like crazy running or stair i probably burn 300 to 350 for an hour of super intense weight lifting my watch will consistently tell me my burn is 800 and 500 calorie for these respectively i have even adjusted my weight downward in the watch to change the calculation and it doe not help much to test this on your own find a good website for what you probably burn doing exercise and compare this to your watch i know this is not the point of marque is video but his calorie count at the beginning of this video triggered one of my gripe with my watch and with calorie racking on most device
1859,all that feature are great and all but if it only going to last 2 day is a pas hard pas
1860,it is an ultra and not pro because it isn t for professional use it is for hobby user with more money macbook pro imac pro iphone pro these are for pro user a pro scuba diver or pro mountain hiker never gon na take an ultra
1861,for 800 buck u can get into the swiss watch game tissot hamilton brand like that i really like the concept of this smartwatch but the idea of a smart watch doe not appeal to me in any way like a mechanical wristwatch doe
1862,bro it is not pro a they made it strong for ultra user pro is for professional people who need more performance but not strong ultra rough and tough hardware plus there ai not anything like more performance in an apple watch so yeah they made an ultra plus it is the only device that help you the most in emergency so they they made it rough and tough than more performance and ram and all new apple watch have most feature so no ned for pro pls like and comment if you agree
1863,should have been apple watch pro max why go samsungs route and the same with samsung they call they high end watch pro now should have been galaxy watch 5 ultra
1864,it is going to be a definitive nah
1865,marque i love the aesthetic that you put in all your video but wtf wa that drawing jk love you man
1866,i prefer my garmin fenix and i wear that not only for work out but all the time maybe i should get the apple watch to wear it once every other month while i have to charge the fenix
1867,when the music started i started to look for other tab that i might have opened by accident weird outro
1868,just say 48 hour
1869,he is a watch guy that hodinkee john mayer edition
1870,fun fact samsung released the latest galaxy watch 5 pro i feel like apple released the ultra to fire shot back at samsung
1871,4 17 get casey neistat to paint it after all he is back in nyc
1872,massive garmin do not lie please
1873,look like trash tbh would prefer series seven any day
1874,i am sorry but this watch is made for men i have the the 40mm watchse and it fit well this ultra one is ginormous it is not fair for small wrist person
1875,i would love to see the next year is galaxy watch 6 pro challenging this year is apple watch ultra
1876,being hyped over an dollar800 smart watch lasting 2 day is not something i will ever understand i have a huawei gt2 pro that cost a tenth and run for two week straight no issue track my sleep and my workout just a well sure the apple watch may have feature like running fortnite i would assume but the test you have made only cover 2 basic function all smart watch nowadays offer for le lasting week on a single charge
1877,after selling my one kidney i can easily say this watch wa worth it
1878,that watch look soo good if i had the money i would buy that thing right now sadly i do not have
1879,i already decided not to buy it but still sat through the whole video speaks so good so easy to listen to
1880,why do not they come out with a pro max apple watch in making the screen size more larger too since they got the 12 13 and now 14 pro max not ultra i can not wait until they come out with a 8 inch foldable iphone like it is competitor samsung for a change instead of the same boring shape and size all the time
1881,you wear your watch on your right wrist
1882,you wear a watch depending on what your main hand is he might just be left handed or he might not like the crown to stab his hand
1883,man your intro graphic really is amazing
1884,just get a garcin forerunner
1885,marcus always ha the best review and apple always make good product
1886,give me a watch that is shoot laser and i will buy it
1887,they should have called it the apple watch explore
1888,apple is real talent is making money the only dollar800 watch i will ever use is the mudmaster
1889,nah
1890,0 17 nice
1891,waiting for the airpods pro 2 review
1892,this is a poor man is garmin pro in my opinion in term of the perfect adventure watch if anyone is considering a watch for activity sport tracking then you would be mad not to consider the garmin fenix range the battery is still dreadful compared to my garmin nice style here from apple though but they are far away from a real sport watch still
1893,we know the new iphone 14 pro and max ha the chinese chip in it but doe that watch ha it a well
1894,no fiuck your stupid as drawing everybody need ruggedness feature battery
1895,i have never wanted a product le than this one completely useless to me
1896,in my opinion the apple watch ultra gen 1 isn t good enough good for pro scuba diver and for pro hiker i don t know how good it is for pro trial running i m pretty sure gen 2 or gen 3 will be much better but gen 1 is only for hobby diver and hiker
1897,a someone that sometimes take bath or go for a walk i probably do not need this
1898,the background and aesthetic are not a good a it wa once
1899,hey that is your personal opinion regarding the look and size a a tech reviewer you should state doe this watch check all the box for the ultra user
1900,most of these feature u do not need in daily life i hope u guy should focus more on that whether whats necessary or not
1901,if you turn on the workout app on your apple watch and went to sleep you will wake up to find that you have burned more than 1000 kcal test it out mkbhd with the same workout you used to record your frisby play
1902,lol thats pretty good thats two day and two night what a way to give additional point
1903,the production quality of your video keep getting better and better love it
1904,to be honest dollar800 is only slightly expensive on the grand scale of watch
1905,the true why they do not use it because of the price
1906,apple watch garmin pro
1907,not expensive enough for a pro name
1908,hi i do not think it would be the same after an year or 6 month what is your experience i used apple 1 2 and then stopped now
1909,this is the first device that is beyond any tech reviewer aka ultra none of ya can actually review it
1910,but is there a feature to delete all on text rather than 1 by 1
1911,this thing is ridiculous
1912,it kind of ugly to me
1913,i have a fossil 6 i wanted a samsung both the same price but doe not work with iphones the battery barely last 24 hour on extended mode i can not afford a dollar800 watch
1914,bought this and returned it the same day decided to just get the i watch se
1915,anodize it yourself
1916,it also show where apple is heading to flat screen and edge in watch too
1917,that thing look like the watch inspector gadget used to wear in the 1980s go go gadget watch and ultra is a cool word to the anime kid so had to use that instead of pro because logic hahaha awesome video a always those transition when showing the different feature whew buttery
1918,can you change lap while running with the press of a button
1919,hey bro why you do not talk about all the bug packed on the new iphones because the pixel one or the oneplus late update ha been in every review you did from them you are cool bro but this channel is not a objective a it used to be
1920,how did you get that gnarly scar
1921,nice
1922,lol toy company who would go trekking for day with this
1923,i love apple watch i left for garmin because 22days battery life and map over path in forest apple can not do that apple messures tvings thats not realy is important and just stress people
1924,i would love a video on the best watch to get i am on a budget and i have a samsung i love apple but i would enjoy a best watch to get type video

1929,apple watch ultra 3 4 day use garmin huawei samsung and etc
1930,is marque a lefty
1931,at the beginning of the video the watch wa on theater mode that is why the battery lasted so long
1932,do you have notification on i feel like the notification kill the battery life
1933,who the fuck wear the watch on the right wrist and randomly put it on the left wrist super odd
1934,that graphic music intro damn
1935,meanwhile galaxy watch4 with around 5 day lit of the box battery hmm
1936,nah
1937,bro where is the airpods pro 2nd gen review
1938,i would love apple to make a smartphone slightly bigger than this ultra watch so that i can just hook it with a carabiner with a spring and hang it on my trouser is belt hook can even hang on your shoulder bag or wear it on your neck like a stopwatch i think we need smartphones to change shape for diff usage style already i would trade my pocket phone for that
1939,markass brownie
1940,i am holding out on orion is wrist computer from chuck
1941,that battery life and screen alone is reason to upgrade i bought one and love it
1942,i am a pro airpods user bc of the tism need that anc big time
1943,you have a tan line on your wrist
1944,i do not watch his video for just only review anymore but is like a story now

1946,to expensive wor what it doe no thanks
1947,thank you for this amazing review
1948,mark as brownie
1949,what is that cherry blossom like bonsai on the left look dope
1950,i saw so many hype chaser buying this watch on friday people that will never use any of it potential i am getting this watch for the fact that i plan on becoming scuba certified but mostly because i hike a lot and i see the waypoints feature saving my life last year i wa in the desert in california and wa limited to walking in a straight line to avoid getting lost in the dune had i had this watch i could have retraced my step and gotten back to safety having it for it new cool factor ha no bearing on me
1951,i do not do any of that sport stuff and i work in it i do not need any of those top end feature but i got this watch anyway because the battery and size i have wanted one but never liked the smaller one battery for battery reason and the material
1952,the only reason i am getting and want the ultra is the size i like be a pip fatboy on my wrist
1953,funny when people get stuff for free the complain
1954,amazfit for the win ultra there will be the ultra pro next year
1955,imma wait for the ultra pro max model
1956,imagine solar panel under the display that would be a game changer
1957,why do you switch wrist
1958,marquise you do not get any issue from sleeping with the watch on
1959,can you play pandora on the speaker
1960,bro so go for you bro for iphone 14 is the best one today is cool
1961,they should have made it so it track your distance within your sport
1962,look fine
1963,thank you for illustrating what a hiker doe with a shot of you walking lol
1964,anyone know where to get that t shirt
1965,i just watched the iphone 8 from apple and it doe all the same thing my iwatch 4 doe when it ha a camera then i will be impressed
1966,hii marque need one help
1967,seems a watch for poser
1968,you are right in the middle of those circle
1969,for a guy who strictly review tech there is another level of comfort in knowing marque also ha great taste in pen
1970,800 dollar for a watch is crazy
1971,not really til you account for the strong dollar
1972,it is a watch for people from the inside who think they are anywhere near the outside same people that spend 10k on a bike while being overweight
1973,did you have display on through your test
1974,make for a nice flashlight if you need it
1975,aluminum sapphire and orange band seems a page from garmin fenix watch
1976,doe it have an always on second hand other apple watch do not have that feature
1977,is marque left handed he put watch on his right arm like i do and i am left handed
1978,dress it up
1979,the ultra give me the thing i wanted why went to garmin the action button when running i wanted to start stop with a physical button and not do multiple touch screen gesture while i see this watch competing well with the top tier garmin model out there cheaper one will still have their place
1980,i really would like to have this ultra but it cost the double s8 and since your explanitaion wa very good i belive the s8 it will suit very nice to my need and work out thanks for the video
1981,i would love if apple do minor version of this one 45 mm would just perfect
1982,nice
1983,it almost biologically impossible to burn 2k calorie in 3 hour lmao you would have to be doing hiit and it just not possible to keep it going for 3 hour lol
1984,i really like this review the illustration pointing out who would be more fit to use the watch help me understand if i really need this watch ultra
1985,did you take your shower
1986,yes worth it just for the extra battery life
1987,hi marque they have come long way to still i guess little more to catch up with garmin especially if you consider battery life and more accuracy obviously the integration of apple ecosystem in cellular version like ultra which is edge over garmin and the ecg or body temperature but still little long way to catch up on the mentioned thing and ruggedness hopefully they will catchup soon till then i am on garmin fenix pro solar series what do say about that
1988,2000 calorie burned every day
1989,here the million dollar question which will prob happen first big issue with it is it not for all wrist n they will lose purchase due to that reason alone also one color a well will be a issue for people who want that option 1 do we see 2 size next year maybe this size and say a 45mm for smaller wrist 2 do we see color option there prob looking at sale for now n determine it from there
1990,yooooooo we have the same tree lego set
1991,just dropped my first video check it out please
1992,how is apple gon na top this next year i think they should make an ultra with only 47 mm to get people back they have lost with the my wrist
1993,2 30 mkbhd graphic really coming along
1994,look good doe the screen have pwm
1995,what are in those box behind you i am so curious
1996,it is going to sell like hotcake
1997,actually iwatch ultra is a watch for people who want to display status on their wrist people who do those extreme type of sport are better off with a watch that is specifically made for their type of activity and that is what you gon na see in the end like 90percent of people who will wear this watch will propably use it to check their message
1998,what would be an instant solution to the battery life not lasting a long a other rugged extreme watch is if they made a band that had solar charging panel and allowed the charge to go through to the metal band locking point
1999,you always make a big deal for no reason marquess
2000,hello marque if you look on amazon you can find different coloured snap on protective case for the apple watch 8 and ultra a well a watch band for le cheer
2001,nice try apple but we are having garmin for this thing
2002,how long did it take you draw all of the stick figure how many calorie did you burn
2003,make video about samsung watch 5 pro
2004,the oceanic subscription is a no go also i wish they had air integration soon i hope
2005,that is pretty good i have got a fitbit versa 3 and it last me 6 day of charge
2006,i would say the pro version of apple product are for cooler people a a cool person i definitely feel this is ideal for me
2007,it look like a watch 8 enclosed in a larger case watch 8 or 7 ha smaller frame around the screen
2008,my ultra is not lasting nearly this long did you run yours in low battery mode for some of the time
2009,i could not get past that you kept switching the watch to ur right wrist when you drove
2010,apple should look into tiodizing the watch titanium version of anodizing not black but a darker grey color
2011,or or it is for people who wear gshocks or like big watch like a seiko tuna
2012,how long doe it last without the iphone close by for how long can you go iphone free so with iphone in airplane mode and blutooth switched off in setting not just control center
2013,nice review and i am exactly one of outside people yet will not buy those a the battery is not simply good enough for me the minimum is week on battery to event think about buying any watch tbh i am surprised that apple did not built long battery with their watch such a innovative company full of genius people yet battery suck while competitor have it for year
2014,in your opinion what airpods do u think fit the most airpods pro2 silicon tip or airpods with no silicon tip
2015,i am sorry apple for fuck sake make a round watch until they make a round watch i will never wear one of these thing watch are round make it look like a watch already holy hell
2016,this watch seems awesome but damn dollar800
2017,i am just a regular user who need a resistant case to my job in an ambulance and like the design or the bigger display and more brightness from the ultra and i am not in your draw
2018,if apple watch battery can last day why do not they make the iphone battery last that long bro
2019,the thing funny with this person is he always end up complaining pretty much sure about it
2020,10 36 what computer were you using xps maybe
2021,my biggest complaint is that they did not add the satellite so that we see in iphone 14 that is what would have made this a must have for me instead of buying an apple watch ultra replacing s7 and an iphone 14 i will just be buying a 14
2022,you are missing circle there in that diagram where are the demographic of people who just love and look for oversized watch there are watch brand dedicated to this demographic diesel invicta fossil and the demographic of people that do not love but just do not mind and concentrate in the feature your diagram is incomplete and full of whole style and fashion are missing how many different type of watch have you wear in your life which one you like the most
2023,i am buying one for sure just for the battery life doe it have cellular feature if so it is also a life saving device should your phone not be an option they are out now going today thanks brother
2024,that intro is one of the sickest intro i have seen the team and marque continue to outdo themselves
2025,no it not worth it smartwatches and save dollar500 00 it is apple way to get you to spend more money on something you will only use for a week or two
2026,that wa impressive catch
2027,wow i would never imagine frisbee a an actual competitive sport thanks for the new information
2028,i can see a lot of people buying this just because it is a wicked watch like people who wear courier bag even though they do not even own a bike
2029,apple product to unbox at the back
2030,waiting on mine is now
2031,commenting for youtube algorithms3
2032,why you drawn only thin people where the fat people and why they are all bald
2033,compare it with galaxy watch 5 pro or a separate review for that will be good too
2034,into epic review really good now on to unrelated question 1 anyone know if marque did an operation on the wrist due to any injury playing ultimate frisbee i ask this super privacy invading question cuz i had a muscle injury on my wrist 9 month old and i still have not recovered and the doc said surgery will only lead to lifelong chronic pain and i will never get my full strength back 2 the part of the video where he go to nowhere how is a black guy in u unafraid of cop or some random psycho that he dare to go into an unpopulated area
2035,just fyi the new compass app is available for series 7 and up not sure about 6 and below
2036,6 hour of ultimate frisbee practice over a weekend are you pro
2037,mkbhd is a right hand watch user righties represent
2038,are you sure it is 100 meter i remembered they spoke about 40 meter deep in the presentation
2039,but it still dollar800 watch
2040,i am still waiting for your apple airpods pro 2 review
2041,cool thanks
2042,airpods pro 2 review is up
2043,whoah what is that keyboard
2044,i really want this for the dive computer that is fancy a hell but it is just wayyy too expensive for me
2045,no chance buy a used rolex it would be worth more in a few year whereas this will be useless
2046,at 8 59 marque mention oceanic will be able to do air integration but that is not true the apple watch ultra doe not have any capability to communicate with wireless air integration transmitter that are attached to the tank is first stage regulator edit i have now continued the next few second of the video where he mention it doe not do tank pressure monitoring correct but that is what air integration mean so i am still unsure why he say it support ai
2047,compare it to a garmin watch
2048,how can i get one of this tho wanted an iphone for a long time too
2049,a an avid hiker and fitness enthusiast i wa drawn to the ultra while the battery life is a key feature for me it is the ruggedness and lightweight body sold it for me i did not preorder at launch a i wanted to try it out and see how it looked it is a big watch and i have skinny wrist but i did not find it to be too big it arrives in two day so excited
2050,2coop4u part 2 if people like it and can afford it what is the problem
2051,unske the dual frequency gps is super useful for me with photography and i will leave my phone at home when i go out it also ha very good triangulation with the mics so no wind noise come in i also can take this watch skiing and have a big enough display for my huge hand the night display help with night photography it is great for me to each their own
2052,lol avid hiker and fitness enthusiast describes half the planet trust me you do not need an 900 dollar smart watch this product is for niche clientele and professional but if you want to waste money be my guest i warned you
2053,starbase sight why is everyone attacking me
2054,2coop4u part 2 and you are sounding pretty broke
2055,8 13 a cheaper product surely wont solve the problem lol
2056,i got the previous model but will trade it in a few year for this model
2057,it is ugly
2058,i would really love the ultra in matte black not a fan of silver
2059,studio tour 2022 pls pls
2060,where the watch lack is software tracking weightlifting amp strength training workout recording set amp rep marking body part i mean garmin is above amp beyond i would use every feature i just got ta save for it very impressive and love the review pretty spot on thanks i will be saving for it
2061,yup my coros pace 2 can do all this and for a fraction of the cost obviously i can not make call or send text or control music from the watch but it can do everything else also it is battery last about 1 week so catch up apple
2062,29kalel i know there are many amp are good but who want to have an additional app syncing issue with strava and they usually have a subscription tied to it garmin ha it all included for free
2063,there are apps in the app store for that
2064,i have had like 8 ad on this video wtf youtube
2065,if the water resistance rating is anything like that for regular mechanical or quartz watch please do not wear this watch for diving wr 100m doe not actually mean you can submerge a watch to 100m and also an apple watch with a tux is just a fashion faux pa not matter which version just saying
2066,it is a question of style over function and style always win
2067,2 day and 2 night what a joke d
2068,all that radiation wearing a smart watch no thanks
2069,just something that i noticed you were wearing the watch on your right wrist and i thing it wa not built to be worn on the right hand because then you can not operate the crown a you could if you were wearing it on the left hand
2070,buy garmin otherwise you are a loser hipster
2071,really is not for me waiting for apple to release a minimalistic watch so i can continue wearing my automatic watch in the other wrist
2072,the best no sense apple ultra price watch
2073,test same watch after 1 year amp make sure post the video here
2074,apple suck get over it
2075,i think the calorie these thing show that you would have burned are a little too optimistic
2076,to worth that price it need to have solar charging 2 day battery is nothing
2077,it is only worth it if you are not living in la lol in la it is or hand it over bro
2078,love the shirt marque a a spacex technician that look like a falcon heavy great video by the way i plan on scooping up this ultra
2079,part of my problem with every smart watch is that unsightly gap between the watch and wrist
2080,why not just get a garmin
2081,a a person who is lazy this watch is very helpful to me a it will not break under my weight after 2 month
2082,why do you wear your watch on the right hand do not you know
2083,i think the fact you did 6 hour of workout and got 2 full day is what will work for most of the target market anyway is there anything else out there with that quality and size of screen and the gps plus heart and that battery life i would have thought they would have made sure it would work for an ironman triathlon though i get the tradeoff of what is even possible should be enough for 99percent of people and scenario do i want one no not at all but i gave up long distance running a long time ago
2084,i will stick with my garmin tactix delta just spent the last three day hiking in the rockies using gps tracking on my watch 6 7 hour per day still have 60percent battery life left
2085,here i am again watching something i can not afford to buy
2086,hey marque love from india waiting for airpods pro 2 review thank you
2087,69percent battery nice that is what i am here for well done
2088,just love the falcon heavy shirt
2089,im gon na get the apple watch series 8 i just have to wait for my check to come in im gon na order the apple watch series 8 from amazon
2090,i am impress ultra thank you so much brownlee
2091,impressive feature and beautiful display but miss the mark big clunky and mediocre battery life this ultramarathoner will stick with coros
2092,but why he is wearing it on right hand
2093,incre ble video bro
2094,wow it ha a smartphone price
2095,watch go on the left it nothing me haha
2096,i am not at all athletic i just want it because i like watch
2097,not sapphire crystal just ask jerry rig
2098,these watch are worthless after 4 5 year might a well invest 1k on an actual watch that will last you year
2099,why do we need an apple watch
2100,i think you are wearing the watch wrongly that crown ha to be on the other side if you are wearing it on the right hand otherwise no direct access to use the crown without blocking the screen
2101,is ultra better than pro i consider the edition or stainless steel to be pro
2102,where to watch the match
2103,i do not believe the calorie counter on the apple watch one bit
2104,no way you had cellular enabled for that 2 day battery life
2105,or you could buy a garmin and get allot more funtionality
2106,the battery life alone worth the update
2107,i always find it interesting when righties wear their watch on their dominant arm i think they might be somewhat ambidextrous to pull it off
2108,ultra gt samsung
2109,anything apple related is obviously not related a it is already outdated technology just a bunch of soy boy sheep is obsessed over garbage lmfao
2110,this watch is overkilled again
2111,i need this for diving great review
2112,doe any apple watch band fit the ultra
2113,it need ant
2114,protrek yeah
2115,i got the amazfit gtr pro limited edition and the battery life is amazing l9ve it
2116,cool still fold combo though yeah definitely getting there
2117,i am not mad at this but since i have the 7 i will wait and see what they come with next look like they are paying attention to consumer need but for me i need it to be black definitely expensive but if they learn enough i would bet they nail the next version bigger screen better battery and black
2118,69percent battery nice
2119,i do not know if i could live with dollar800 on my wrist
2120,if you look at the color available with titanium anodizing you will see that most are very vivid and bright black is not among them
2121,i have de casio protek you show and look and feel better using it apple watch it feel too big square design i will stick with casio never end battery triple sensor
2122,this is the only apply product that ha generally wowed me samsung new watch ultra instinct will be far superior though lol
2123,6 50 ultra ftw in scrabble
2124,we use the same pen
2125,not gon na lie i hate apple for many year but im considering the iphone pro max with the watch ultra air pod gen 3 charger and case would be around dollar2500 tho
2126,who edits for you please tell me i need to learn from them
2127,short answer no long answer do you like just burning money
2128,i know your not the right person to be asking this question but come on is spotify ever going to consider adding 2fa
2129,yo can not you like give me a short answer a yes or no would be nice
2130,why did you choose gimmick collector a a lifepath you likely only have one human life
2131,i am not sold on this i am waiting for the ipad watch pro lite
2132,nope black color would absorb the sun light and your watch will heat up during your adventure trip
2133,they will launch another apple watch next year with just the bigger screen and battery and call it the pro
2134,ultra is a better name than pro for the watch because they are trying to target people doing ultra marathon ironman etc
2135,if you pay 800 for this you are a super sheep and you are trying way too hard
2136,i get two day from my series 7 i have never thought to worry about the battery life i see people saying a few hour you need a new watch
2137,i have series 5 and with the os9 the watch is still very nice the ultra is made for the people that make these activity the rest of u i believe that we can live with the normal apple watch in the usa it is cost 800dollar in europe it cost 1040euros it is expensive for a watch that if something happens to the screen what would be the cost to repair it with that money you could buy a good regular watch or a cheaper garmin or a gshock or 2 apple watch
2138,you could have mentioned sth about charging speed for this model is it still fast to charge or not etc
2139,look like during part of your testing that you had theater mode turned on wa that part of your testing
2140,1570 dollar in my country turkey in your country usa 800 dollar
2141,i personally like the watch ultra mostly because it reminds me of running ultra is or doing ultra triathlons
2142,watch in general is gimmick
2143,did anyone catch the website for the leather band he mentioned
2144,annodizing titanium to a variety of color is actually pretty easy they could have a rainbow of color and black if they wanted
2145,a a cross country skiier i have been looking forward to this finally i can do 3 hour workout then do another one and still have sleep tracking in a single charge
2146,incredible waste of money
2147,just ask yourself is battery the reason why you buy a watch yes the answer is indeed what you are thinking you are an idiot
2148,epic battery life but the thing is just too big for me
2149,not worth it
2150,great review crazy cal burn thanks
2151,why is on a different wrist every other shot
2152,airpods pro 2 review
2153,i have skinny arm too and i have the 44 mm 2020 se but i would get the ultra anyway look good
2154,probably because samsung named their watch pro first
2155,what is there for poor pro like me
2156,hey marque if you are really after making it black check out dlc diamond like coating us a carbon coating with a rockwell hardness above that of common metal to provide a scratch resistant coating extremely popular for folding knife and edc gear
2157,start reviewing cheap product also
2158,have you tried amazfit trex it give 45 day in standby
2159,i am sure after market company will make silicon case in different color for those of u who would like some variety in it is look
2160,nice
2161,2 17 channelling his inner minutephysics
2162,i hope they are going to continue this line next year i will be replacing my series 4 with one
2163,2 day and 2 night and into the 3rd day but seems you had theatre mode on the whole time
2164,i would have liked to buy one but it is the shape and battery that kill it for me and make me love my fenix even more common apple 7 10 day battery with 38h gps mode and a shape that doesnt look like a toaster strapped to my wrist and ill buy one
2165,why doe the watch keep switching wrist
2166,how doe it compare to a high end garmin watch doe anyone know compared to the f nix or enduro
2167,your airpods have run out of battery is that 1 11
2168,ok now just make it work on android and i m in
2169,correction you are apple reviewer most if it come to phone and watch you never reviewed any wear o watch like never so do not expect u to take your word for it i am sure you biased a other apple user
2170,very impressive the fact it went 2 night doing sleep tracking is even more i would expect it to last that long without sleep tracking and just being idle at night but the fact it wa actually doing something over night is that much more impressive
2171,mohammed rajab but doe it do all the feature that this apple watch doe like diving
2172,mohammed rajab xiaomi is a ccp chinese communist party company so no thanks supporting the ccp and sharing your data with the ccp is for idiot
2173,xiaomi mi band can do 2 week of sleep tracking
2174,sleep tracking is basically just heart rate check and recording motion it is not super battery heavy to track sleep
2175,could have partnered with primer
2176,a much a i like marque review this one of his weakest he is really not giving u the use case scenario for this watch other than it is got a bigger battery cnet went place to show how this thing can integrate in an active lifestyle
2177,broo please share your workout routine 2000 cals is insane
2178,missed opportunity to say this watch ha major r b f
2179,i do not know why but this watch kinda look china ish to me
2180,am i crazy or is the watch switching from your left to right wrist when you are driving
2181,still oneplus watch is much better
2182,ultra 2 maybe not particular fond of no choice
2183,watch is insane wow
2184,why can not apple make a right handed watch like rolex did
2185,you inspired me to start my own youtube channel i think i will name it bdsmmlk what do you think
2186,what a coincidence he inspired me to make my own channel i named it bbwmlk
2187,all i wan na know is can i get every app on the watch that i have on my phone that is all i need
2188,i got my ultra watch today and literally do not know what i should try first should i go swimming should i go up a hill hmm
2189,the editing and style of this video wa very casey neistatish now that he is back in new york really hope you collab for something new that no one ha not seen before
2190,i wa just waiting for the line u can get d brank skin matte black
2191,pricing make iphone look like a bargain
2192,i do not know why but this watch remind me so much of my omega that i have which is plus i love my omega sea master to death
2193,what you know about the fight club scar adn do not tell u you can not talk about it
2194,gimic but apple zombie are fooled by anything
2195,in serbia retail price for this watch is 1220 euro gigatron and in germany it is 1000 euro mediamarkt
2196,can it make me transform to four arm if not the price is not accepted
2197,i had 2 different apple watch but i could never get them to match my work out battery life wa not great i invested in a garmin with a week is worth of battery if apple can do a apple watch with a week is battery of course le feature i definitely fall in that outer ring of people that have different need
2198,pretty sure you got it on the wrong arm
2199,a watch is supposed to be worn on the left wrist that is why the crown is on the right accept when your right handed
2200,hiker battery will not last mtie day with gps no map for navigation from what i have seen endurance athlete can not connect additional external sensor
2201,kala munda
2202,99 dollar for the band whaaaaaaatttttt
2203,nah
2204,zero interest in this hideous thing
2205,throughout the video i wa wondering he is wearing watch in his right hand
2206,weird that they went with ultra name like samsung
2207,cheaper than my titanium and sapphire series 6
2208,doe le than the garmin epix 2 and cost le id say apple nailed the pricing for once hopefully they will step up to the better battery native navigation and ant or at least let you pair external sensor without a 3rd party app in the future otherwise garmin will always have the edge
2209,bro burned 2000 calorie
2210,it a really impressive watch i really like the dual gps i think that is useful will you also review the samsung galaxy watch 5 pro
2211,i think for apple pro mean prosumer
2212,any serious athlete or outdoorsman will still get a garmin this feel like the poser hiker watch to me
2213,99dollar watch strap lmao
2214,i wish it wa black also
2215,doe that casio do a fraction of the apple watch though when considered it is quite impressive of apple
2216,lol 2 day battery android watch have 1 week battery
2217,it should not be pro it should be explorer edition
2218,why theater mode
2219,i honestly believe that the apple watch got steve job spinning in his grave just do not think it is the idea he would approve
2220,to think i thought 200dollar for a series 3 like 4 year ago wa crazy
2221,if you have never scuba dived you should definitely experience it you will not regret it definitely a whole new experience
2222,for it to be truly a standalone watch i would like to see it have camera recording
2223,i think apple should stop beating around the bush and make the actual pip boy from fallout game lol
2224,i think the pro added to apple product name just do not matter lmao i honestly still do not get how some people i know like try and figure out the literal meaning and i am depth message and shit bro it is a name relax at worst they wan na tailor the product to professional who it would work for it ai not that deep
2225,apple ha really upped their game with this watch i am impressed however i am an avid garmin fenix 7x user and previous 6x owner i know the ultra should be compared to the epix 2 based on battery life and screen but i opted for the bigger and better for longevity i think apple is on the right track if their goal is to keep gain even the extreme adventurer interested i must say i am really digging the look of this ultra and would love to see where they go with it there are some small feature on the ultra i wish would be on the fenix but it go both way even though the fenix 7x is a little overkill for my us it still brings an app that is a capable on android a it is on io it is not an amoled screen but it still touch capable and the reflective display is super readable in sunlight and add to the overall 28 day average batter life fenix 7x is a watch i know i can also make last 5 year minimum with feature that will be a strong then a they are now
2226,the big lack that prevents me from buying a fenix is the fact that there is no cellular possibility i would like to go running without having to bring with me my phone
2227,joel and also can not connect to device like ant bluetooth device poeer meter erg bike chest strap hr etc for the intended user
2228,if people spend big buck for case material and band a well a being part of the apple ecosystem why would not anybody anybody pay for a bigger screen longer battery life bigger control better gps better water resistance etc not just extreme athlete yes the normal watch is fine but we are talking about the apple universe
2229,how the hell are you gon na charge that watch if you are in a mountain for a week
2230,for some of u that ha bad eyesight the bigger screen will help
2231,i think this time the perfect user are the one that us all the feature i think that the review must come from these guy just to get a perfect accuracy of the phone
2232,feel like part of why apple didnt name it a watch pro is due to samsung is watch pro 4 5 already having the name and the galaxy phone with the ultra a extra fuel
2233,so they swapped name basically
2234,hi marque great video here is the real question what did you do in the 3 hour work out in the morning that burn 900 calorie you are a cool dude
2235,the editing is getting wild i love it
2236,that wa a sweet catch
2237,flex factor yeah it pretty good
2238,hello mr mkbhd a you know iran goverment cut the internet in iran and they killing men and woman for protesting against morality police and they recently kill mahsa amini because of her hijab please be our voice and let the other people know what is happening in iran many thanks you re big fan bigby
2239,i believe that apple didnt call it a pro due to them might wanting to have a watch between the standard series and the ultra which they could call pro
2240,finnaly i can say thank you my dear may love help you
2241,wow i just purchased the apple watch 8 i did not think the battery on the ultra would last long enough while in gps mode for long 100 mile bike ride or multi day hike if i had known about the gps battery save mode i might have purchased the ultra
2242,it is a fucking pip boy
2243,great review
2244,it would be great if they just make the normal apple watch is battery last more than a day the main reason it will be a long time till i get another one i will stick with my garmin that last 4 5 day
2245,finally someone asking what pro mean in phone tablet earphone etc dumbest name ever they put pro on tech the way they put sport on every other car out there
2246,best tech youtube channel in this world subscribed since 2013 10 year for me
2247,phenomenal drawing
2248,garmin wa right
2249,3 hour practice man i struggle to find 1 5 hour to go to the gym
2250,if marque make a shirt out of that caricature it will sell like crazy
2251,literally choked on saliva at the middle of nowhere very convincing over there lmao
2252,but doe it blend
2253,pro to apple is another name for rich if you are rich get the pro if you are not get the regular one but they are not gon na come out and tell you oh the pro is for rich and the regular one are for the poor people they need all the money they can get so that is bad advertising they just call the product pro common sense should tell you what it mean the more expensive one come with all the feature you could possibly think of it is just there do not be fooled
2254,ok it is been too long i need to see an airpods pro 2 review i do not care about apple watch ultra or the iphone 14 is
2255,pro having increased feature performance with fewer material ultra bigger material with bigger spec like a samsung i feel the naming here is a dig at samsung
2256,i feel like this will be a much better fit for me especially in my line of work working on metal stamping press something is killing my regular apple watch with no physical damage they just start glitching and trying to power off or call 911 un prompted after a few month or so send them off for warranty repair and they just send a replacement and i try and see if i can make it last a lil longer lol
2257,what size band did you get with your watch
2258,would be interesting to see the accelerometer data during a frisbee throw
2259,i will buy an apple watch ultra or pro the day it come with solar charging else not good enough for me garmin and casio got the method down proper
2260,i am up to minute 9 59 and i am waiting waiting to find out the exact screen size did i miss it i guess i will have to google it myself
2261,i wanted to buy apple watch but my si told me it hold only a day is it true
2262,dude go get your open water dive cert you will dig it
2263,hey what happened to your hand marque
2264,i like where it is going but it is still not strong enough for u real alpine climber
2265,high pro mountaineer and diver keep saying it is not good enough compared to a garmin yet you still advertise that the watch is made for u how much is apple paying you
2266,i crash often and i crash hard on my mountain bike great to have a tank beacon on my wrist just in case i need it
2267,the waypoints bring a gta esque map to life
2268,honestly i am waiting for a iphone se pro lol
2269,that bass drop on 1 11
2270,the first 1 2 minute intro wa dope better amp honest than apple watch commercial
2271,i would buy it if they did not make the button orange and massive and the frame grey
2272,intro graphic
2273,tesla stearing grip elite
2274,i just do not get the main appeal they basically make a sport watch my two year old not too of the line sport watch ha nearly all these feature is not a massive and the battery last nearly a week that is with having it on 24 7 and 1 3 hour of training six time a week oh and it cost dollar170 new not dollar800 but oooo apple so i have to get it
2275,when is watch 5 pro review
2276,i am not an apple fan but i love this new watch from apple i like the look i love big screen i am on the galaxy watch 5 pro now but i much prefer that apple watch i never thought i would say this one now im shy lol
2277,a good friend of mine ha this amazing garmin watch purely for sport he run and bike with it it ha an amazing ai system couching you ti help with your goal i miss this software on my apple watch doe this one ha new feature for these sport
2278,absolutely love your review man
2279,i am not an extreme athlete far from it actually i just happen to do a little of everything the apple watch ultra touch i dive very casually swim way more often i hike and camp occasionally but never too far off a beaten path i also run and ride bike though never in the same day that said i still want the apple watch ultra the battery life is the biggest reason i have held back on getting an apple watch i just do not enjoy having to charge my phone my laptop and my watch every day i have plenty of mechanical watch that i love just having around being able to tell time no matter when i need it it doe not need battery yet get the time down to the second what a beautiful example of engineering but a an it professional i do not get the luxury to be truly on vacation some time i need to monitor my computer even when i am out and about i need to be able to check my email and slack when i am on the beach this is the one thing my mechanical watch can not do my iphone can but it is not ever present like a watch is the apple watch ultra with the battery optimization option is perfect for me i can probably get through the majority of my vacation charging only once midway and i would never need the constant ping for anything health related just a general trend and min max range is plenty now i have an apple watch that is right for me i can dress up my mechanical watch and i will dress down and use the apple watch ultra for casual outing and travel
2280,the aesthetic is kind bad
2281,it is dollar800 in the u but over here in europe it is 1000euros doe anyone know why is there a feature or something significan not that we get in the ultra here in europe i want to get the ultra but if the watch is the same i will wait until i visit the u
2282,can not really compare a casio watch battery to an apple watch battery slight difference in processor power
2283,just another thing apple is stealing from samsung apple is garbage compared to the s22 ultra muchless than the s21 ultra you all are getting feature we have had since the galaxy 10 pathetic
2284,the biggest thing that hold me back from this is how apple tends to work by debuting a look for one device you know on the back end similar device will be following suit shortly after so do i need the ultra for the larger flat screen or just wait one more year when the 9 debut and likely ha this look or something similar i have already made the personal decision that outside of the louder speaker and the action button everything else is not a necessary for my daily use or lifestyle it is a dope look either way but justifying the extra dollar200 did not quite add up great in depth look at thing though much appreciated
2285,a someone who worked apple retail for two year i would say it well worth it if you are an athlete yes they will continue to come out with better version but only once every 4 5 year do they truly innovate on their product with a big leap they did it several year ago with the series 4 and now again
2286,where is your review of z flip 4 z fold 4
2287,my farming last 5 15 day on a single charge and track everything i need for 450
2288,how many of you rewatched that sick catch like 20 time more
2289,for myself to buy an apple watch and get the use out of it would be to make a ruggedised watch like this one a i am work would destroy any other apple watch in day but this one is not the one for me a it is too expensive and designed for a completely different user a shown in the keynote what i would need is this watch without the deep sea diver part and have that replaced by feature that could shrug off fine dust chemical such a turp and solvent and getting covered in paint but this watch doe not make me feel i could wear it work an all round everyday day watch i would be better getting a g shock watch rather than this especially at that price point in saying that it doe not stop me lusting over it but it is way too expensive for me
2290,oh nice someone else wearing the watch on right hand
2291,what is up i have been 40m under water for the past few week with the apple watch ultra
2292,bruuuuh i do not think somebody is goin or would risk scuba under 100meters deep with a 800dollar smart watch
2293,0 10 gaah daymn
2294,is it really common for american ppl to have 2000 calorie day thats insane im always like 500 900
2295,the thing is i find this impossible to accept my galaxy watch 4 last me 48hrs and i got it for free with t mobile i think the retail price is 200 no way in hell would i ever drop 799 or more on anything other than phone computer tablet or camera camera lens my watch can do 95percent of the thing this watch can do and if i needed something more pro i would look for better watch price is unacceptable
2296,which other smart watch is worth buying shitty google wear o watch
2297,why can not apple put a massive 3 day battery in the iphone
2298,can you hear people talk through the watch underwater curious
2299,i eat a much calorie a you burn haha
2300,can not wait to get this watch
2301,according to your logic should not the surgical grade stainless steel watch be the pro series imagine repeating the entire name instead of just watch pro maybe it is introductory reserving name for the iphone fold aka iphone ultra in the future think about it
2302,watch look terrible
2303,um casio charger
2304,mate you were talking about garmin and sunto and you showed a g shock watch they literally have nothing in common
2305,very nice review and video but damn that watch is fugly
2306,thanks for deleting the boring intro edit oh you just retard it forget it
2307,huawei best in smartwatch battery life
2308,i am not in any of the market classification but that battery life is very pulling i am not a sport person but i do depend on my watch quite a bit for navigation and such and those burn through the battery like nothing only 50dollar difference from my usual 749dollar on top of that not bad at all
2309,it doesnt look like apple anymore more like a sony product
2310,why 800dollar i have xiaomi s1 26 day battery cost just 120 dollar
2311,i am a mountaineer and for me this watch is unfortunately not the right one it is not about the hardware but the software i have no integrated possibility to plan my trip or to upload gpx track and watch them on offline map i can use 3rd party apps sure but if i have to pay almost one thousand euro then i can go for a watch that can everything i need
2312,i barely use my series 6 cuz it dy so fast but damn thats a really cool looking watch i can appreciate it it look a lot more squared and flat than the usual round and sticking out apple watch which look soooo much nicer
2313,do the watch sensor work over the sleeve of a winter jacket or diving suit
2314,plz make a comparison with samsung galaxy watch 5 pro
2315,decent review marque
2316,what an expensive price for an ugly as watch this is clear indication of lemming fake action watch for starbucks drinker
2317,speaking about target audience for these watch honestly i just want a regular aw with battery life the same or greater than ultra priced the same or slightly more than regular aw before that happens i am sticking to my garmin despite being a mac and iphone user this show that there are still a lot of people to be convinced despite of what you have drawn on that piece of paper
2318,for the first time am interested in an apple watch
2319,airpods pro 2 review
2320,apple watch samsung ultra
2321,that catch wa dope
2322,i really like the look of the watch and the additional feature but i wanted it in a black
2323,my casio wa going strong on one charge for the past 3 year
2324,great comment here from scuba dive community i believe is a lot of skepticism i am garmin descent mkii user definitively i will try this apple watch on a diving i am wondering if i will jump only with the apple watch or i will bring an extra dive computer with me do not ask me why but i am not 100percent confortable from security stand point
2325,this guy really know how to make a perfect intro
2326,practice what watching watch
2327,look good but i think i will not even utilize 60percent of all these feature nah
2328,welcoming back the intro with voice still miss the ongoing thing
2329,it is a gaming watch only that you do not game on it but you wear while gaming
2330,i would love to see you living with a garmin epix 2 for a week and perhaps review it
2331,the diving aspect really interest me a a rec diver and i love my apple watch 7
2332,something i would love to see you or others discus that ha not been brought up very much is how especially with this year iphone and apple watch feature apple ha decided they are okay with putting a very wide range of company out of business from garmin to all those company that make specialized tool for diver or world class athlete they have serious competition all of a sudden this is a bigger issue than anybody ha yet to really talk about great review a always love the qualify and effort shown in all you do
2333,in the quartz or mechinal watch world 100m wr usually mean it good enough to wash hand be in the rain or at most take a shower with a watch on just keep that in mind before going swimming with it for long period
2334,apple watch ultra 2 day garmin fenix 7 2 week or more
2335,reading the brochure like always
2336,hey marquis when are we going to get an apple v galaxy watch
2337,they seem to have put a lot of thought into this one onto something also that shirt is awesome
2338,can u please cover the motorla edge 30 ultra thank you
2339,if someone is walking into the wilderness they are not using an apple watch this would be something you add to your arsenal after the fact a a bonus most trek are longer than 3 day
2340,buy a garmin mine last 24 day cost dollar200 cheaper
2341,keep in mind for that drawing those people that you drew are still a small percentage of the population most people do not wear smart watch this watche is built for a very small amount of people most people buying this are bad with money
2342,yeah no they should not have called it pro because it is not no idea why habitually misnaming the other gadget make it somehow ok they either do not own a dictionary over at apple or have a hard time understanding definition unless the watch is specifically meant for people who use it to make a living there just is not a reason to call it pro
2343,okay the pen paper thing confirmed that casey neistat is really back in ny
2344,so the galaxy watch us the name pro and ultra for the phone apple us watch ultra and phone pro i think there something here lol
2345,you already got 60 hr of battery 2 full day 2 full night into the 3rd day with 20percent left so 24x2 12 60hrs just a thought
2346,look good on your wrist what size is your wtist in mm
2347,apple and samsung switched their name samsung ha s22 ultra and watch 5 pro where apple ha iphone pro and watch ultra lol
2348,super cool that apple now made a watch that ha a proper battery too bad it is so huge that most people look hilarious when wearing it
2349,800 usd
2350,the best review so far period great job man new subscriber for sure
2351,mkbhd just casually flexing on u peasant about dressing down for the met gala what a chad
2352,worth on your long blessed built body people arm no worth on our short ungifted far east asian guy arm
2353,nice
2354,i would have worn it if i had thicker wrist love all the detail of the watch but the size
2355,a pro smart watch for me would be one that replaces the phone i would only need to take out the phone to take photo or watch video
2356,watch on the right hand feel wierd
2357,i think we exaggerate the wearable tech in general i barely use my apple watch besides looking for time and fitness which could be easily replaced by 20 buck 1 month batery life band wearable are not a usefull a they are hyped just like ai assistant today
2358,all i can think about the watch ultra not being the watch pro mean they have got a different idea for the watch pro
2359,this watch is mainly for adventure purpose and it is called ultra note company is not responsible for charging your watch
2360,ultra is more of a samsung term apple need to stick to pro
2361,extremely niche watch but for those that want it and will use it it will absolutely be an amazing tool
2362,thank you so much for this explanation i preordered yellow ultra
2363,i have just wanted a bigger watch im using 44mm and it is too small for me but idk if 49mm is a big improvement so yeah all those feature would be probably never used by me but i still want to buy ultra for this only reason that it is bigger watch not even a battery life
2364,nice apple watch
2365,fairpoint mkbhd apple could start naming their pro device a ultra
2366,for me a a street biker with 200km ride if it doesnt have ant it really isnt appealing
2367,hell nah
2368,man i got ta say your production value is amazing i am not even interested in the apple watch a i wear a resin marathon gpq old school one with the plastic crystal let alone a smart watch pretty sure you outclass most tv production which i guess is not saying much post mid 2010s but still keep up the great work and be a bastion of high quality content
2369,i wish it wa possible to make the self winding mechanism in automatic watch charge the battery in smart watch idk if it could generate enough energy but if it could that would be a great way to extend battery life
2370,it is funny how this is still not a insane a that gold apple watch they created i seriously hope the people that paid for that thing is still using it to this day
2371,le than a day before the public will finally have access i am so excited
2372,why do you keep switching arm my guy
2373,great review still wearing the watch on the wrong arm
2374,nice review upgrading my 6 edition to this mainly for that l1 l5 gps tech a an avid runner i always felt apple watch wa behind the garmins etc in distance pace tracking but obviously exceeded those running specific watch in daily livability looking forward to workout with this thing
2375,the casio garmin are more for the adventurer id say like the hard core diver and hiker apple samsung are trying to get into the game and not a bad start but battery life a you mentioned the casio with solar or like say the garmin felix or epic 2 will be much better id say too due to the lack of mic or speaker and losing some of the smart feature from iwatch gw 5pro
2376,it look like a pretty good smart watch but if you are looking for a more sport watch than a smart watch i would give garmin fenix line and the garmin epix 2 a check
2377,look dope af tho not a fan of apple watch cuz i am more of a round guy wish they would make like a 50 in samsung pro 5 but this this look like good video you ofcourse can always put like a slim case on it that snap on to protect change black too
2378,for adventure i prefer rolex explorer
2379,i will wait for the apple watch ultra pro max it is 10x better than the apple watch ultra
2380,one aspect i do not think i have ever seen you test i could be wrong is the inability of apple watch and others to properly track heavily tattooed skin i bought and returned my apple watch because i could not use the workout app because it keepa losing my hr i had to dig deep into yt to find a reason for it it wa too annoying and i settled for a fitbit because it wa cheaper and even though it ha the same problem it wa cheap enough to make it a decent choice it suck that there are not really any option for heavily tattooed peep out in the world thanks for your vids and info
2381,i do not understand who is going hiking with this watch and doe not have a whistle on or in their bag this 80db alarm seems designed without a hiking trail in sight
2382,im sorry but watching you try to hold the tesla wheel is so funny like what were they thinking when they made it that way
2383,they are saving the pro for the apple watch ultra pro fyi
2384,can any body share a to which watch he showed for reference please
2385,garmin fenix user here doing workout every day have not recharged it in 2 week still plenty left
2386,feel like apple employee have hacked into your comment section and are rooting for the watch by pretending to be athlete
2387,please do review for samsung watch 5 pro
2388,the reason why they did not call it pro is because by next year they will release a new one and call it ultra pro
2389,great review a a mountaineer i can say that the more accurate gps will be the most important feature i came into life threatening situation just cause my gps wa off by a few meter the backtracking feature will be very useful a well look like a great watch
2390,2 day battery life in the snowy mountain however is not enough it will drain battery very fast and the screen in bright sunlight is not very readable
2391,joel this guy mountain
2392,probably should learn how to navigate with a map and compass then like we used to before gps
2393,my garmen get over 8 day barely 3 with apple tech is sad
2394,series 6 or se 2 got waypoints too
2395,how come sometimes you put the control dial facing your elbow it is annoying i must say
2396,marque i think you hit the nail on the head with your explanation i recently completed a half ironman and my apple watch died with 4 mile left on the run also the new button to press transitioning from each portion of the race would be way easier than having to end the workout and start a new one with wet sweaty finger
2397,julian plazola i m pretty sure gps tracking for 4h killed it
2398,i think you just managed your watch battery terribly my series 3 watch from release date still to this day last me a full day i get it a half ironman is roughly 6 8 hour it should have lasted you longer
2399,brandon so i just picked up the watch 8 for about 1 2 the price of the ultra with a good case probably get the job done when climbing i ran a marathon last weekend and it still had 50percent battery with ao turned off started at 100percent so about 8h it would have been dead
2400,cory kroneman true but older garmins do not have all the feature you are going to find on this ultra like anything it is a trade off if you are running ultramarathons you probably know this watch is not for you based solely on the battery life hopefully apple can continue to improve the battery life but like any product it is not for everyone for me a someone who doe a lot of rock climbing and marathon the battery life is suitable for my need i am not running or climbing for 24 straight hour
2401,this watch will never make it through a full ironman in it current form assuming you are going to be 12h there are quite a few video of people going for 50k run and putting the watch through 8h of gps hr etc and finishing with sub 30percent battery life marathon 1 2 ironman you are good to go 100 mile run is also a no go assuming you are an average runner that will take 24h for a 100 mile run i used the polar m for imwi19 and just made it used both the polar m and a garmin vivoactive 4 for my first 50 miler in october 2020 about 11h run probably 25 30percent battery still remaining this is a great watch but no where near older garmins
2402,he nailed it at the end the reality is it is the best watch
2403,a a garmin and an android fan apple is doing some big thing i will not buy one but it is quite impressive apple fan out there will likely be happy
2404,that orange band is
2405,nah
2406,i like how my ancient gear sport still ha the exact same battery life a that new apple watch and yes i am active even though it 5 year old and the battery capacity is not nearly a much a it used to be not to mention it so much smaller
2407,damn i purchased apple watch series 7 bruh apple watch series 8 ultra
2408,apple want pro to be the upgraded model that everybody want it is an upgrade with no downside except the price you can not call a watch that is ugly af the pro it is called ultra because it is for people with dollar800 garmin watch who are used to wearing ugly but functional watch i run marathon and garmin watch have better battery life and better spotify integration i have no idea why spotify can not get playlist sync working right with apple watch maybe it is just a problem with background refresh and apple watch before the series 6 could never last a marathon the gps used a ton of battery and even bluetooth streaming used a ton
2409,who else is watching tech they can not afford
2410,hej do not worry dbrand will came out darker skin
2411,so how many time did you replay marque ultimate frisky clip
2412,can i wear a regular sport band on this apple watch ultra
2413,my dial button face my hand you have the dial button towards your shoulder why
2414,i think unless they replace your phone entirely people are growing sick of how many screen they have to manage they are also extremely ugly you could just get an oura ring amp an actual good seiko watch
2415,people embracing the watch me embracing 1 00 1 12
2416,idk if it just me but i find you putting the watch on your right hand is extremely uncomfortable
2417,do not worry ultra pro is coming for dollar2000
2418,i click the crown by extending my wrist that would easily cut down on accidentally hitting the new action button which could be a huge pro or a con depending on which button you need
2419,9 38 ha he ever made a video about his scar
2420,yes it is in a ask mkbhd video
2421,man you are really an excellent reviewer it is rare someone can hold my attention for 15mins on anything here on youtube already ordered the watch by the way wonder if there is a couch potato app coming anytime soon
2422,man you are really an excellent reviewer it is rare someone can hold my attention for 15mins on anything here on youtube already ordered the watch by the way wonder if there is a couch potato app coming anytime soon
2423,ill wait for the black pro version
2424,and it is ugly
2425,may i ask where you got the bonsai decoration you have on the background from this video tia
2426,those transition and graphic where impeccable
2427,you press the action button by accident because you are wearing it wrong
2428,i am done sitting tight for the award advance since i acquiredollar23 000 every 12 day of my investment
2429,this is really helpful for my situation i think for people to talk all this good about him he must be an expert
2430,i have also been hearing a lot about his goodness and perfection in trading cryptocurrencies with awesome trading
2431,amazing i also started trading with him recently dollar180 000 profit in just 2 month and still counting mr charles is the crypto trade king a far am concerned
2432,thanks a lot i have contacted him now and he responded i see this a an opportunity to escape my financial situation
2433,how can i reach out to mr charles i urgently need his management on my investment
2434,only apple can sell u watch that can last a whole 2 day a revolutionary i had a series 7 tried an amazfit gtr 3 and have not looked back i do not load up my watch with apps i just need notification alarm workout and hr sleep tracking the gtr doe all this and last for 7 10 day with hr every minute and it did not cost 800dollar lol
2435,i spy a john mayer gshock
2436,you sit there complaining about the product and you still buy it and use it lool
2437,a pro at launching my airpods across the room when i drop them
2438,2 58 i feel like if this thing ha 2 5 day of battery life with regular use it will not cut it for ultra runner and long distance hiker with contant gps recording no way not even if you triple the battery life with that upcoming feature but of course that is the need of one in a thousand looking great though
2439,i am curious what your eating habit and routine is like burning over 2 000 calorie in one workout please enlighten me
2440,complaint about how expensive the ultra is are disingenuous the most comparable aregular apple watch 8 in stainless steel with cellular and a milanese band are also dollar799 dollar749 with the sport band
2441,would you buy the ultra for your 1st watch
2442,knew you from the frisbee vids first1 awesome you still play
2443,why do you keep changing which arm you wear the watch on is that heavy
2444,i think it is called ultra for the ultra running crowd the one that run 50 and 100 mile race these people are using garmin i do not think apple made a good enough product to get that group
2445,fuck spending 800 buck on a smart watch
2446,ok for the record that wa a great catch in that short ultimate clip by the way
2447,hate you man i did not want this watch until your review now i got to have one
2448,marque my broda with a new trim
2449,play music on it thanks if it ha speaker a well
2450,i just came here to say no you did not burn 2000 calorie in 3 hour of ultimate frisbee practice watch and similar device are not accurate i am sure you burned alot but i am sick of people always telling me they burned 800 calorie from a small bike ride so now they can eat an additional 800 calorie of food
2451,i am glad apple ha a watch that go 2 day plus i mean if it doe not last over a day then it defeat the sleep tracking my active 2 watch is like 2 5 day easily and it ha a pretty small battery but these smartwatches need to be like 2 3 day easily to make them worth using all the feature i think dollar800 is a lot but it doe have a lot of pricey feature but apple is usually overpriced to begin with
2452,a year ago i had zero interest in smartwatches i wa only into wearing dive or tool watch then a friend gave me an old apple watch series 2 that i started wearing only for workout and then more often i will admit it grew on me quickly and now i have a series 7 that i love i will definitely be getting an ultra at some point
2453,same here always resisted son gave me an old series 3 a a runner i wa like whoa i do not have to measure my run with my truck odometer anymore
2454,that battery life still kill for most i know in those fringe group they seem to be trying to target i will stick to my fenix that i typically charge up maybe twice a month
2455,the tech is good but it look absurdly big on wrist no thanks
2456,laugh in garmin
2457,5 48 i see you with the hint you just said i pray they do
2458,long a a real watch
2459,i do not think he will ever review a product and not bash something about it
2460,2 000 calorie burned holy shit mkbhd must be eating like 4 000 calorie a day
2461,waiting for galaxy watch pro
2462,can wait for jerryrigeverything to test the saphire
2463,wow the battery sound so interesting to me
2464,8 16 that is not how a compass work if you walk a straight line in a given orientation your heading should remain the same
2465,what would i miss what happened to marque hand
2466,the apple watch ultra may not have the longest battery life out of other dive watch or workout watch but it sure ha the most feature compared to any other watch the apple watch is amazing and the apple watch ultra seems like it will add even more functionality to make apple watch even more awesome
2467,apollo joseph sound good i suppose haha
2468,all those feature and yet battery life is not great nah will stick to withings with the 30 day battery life and meet all the necessary need
2469,the biggest problem with the apple watch is the fact that it is utterly useless without an iphone an iphone is required in order to activate the watch when it come new out of the box you can not even set the time and use it a a plain watch without an iphone so people who are not in the apple ecosystem already will not be going out and buying one of these watch in order to join the apple ecosystem they would already have to be in the ecosystem to be attracted to this watch
2470,those are rookie number my huawei gt3 pro can easily pas 10 day
2471,okay samsung galaxy watch 5 pro next need to know how the battery stack up
2472,hi can i wi an iphone 14 pro and the pro watch a well
2473,win
2474,live a life worthy of the apple watch ultra
2475,honestly just look like an apple watch made for shaq
2476,i do not need those feature but would love the ruggedness of it the normal watch get damage fast in the end it is probably not worth it because i will never keep that thing a long a a real watch
2477,anodizing wear off relatively quickly i have jewelry that is anodized and where there is high contact after about a year it started to wear down not too much where someone would notice but on a watch it would be pretty noticeable
2478,wait to see what the pixel watch will hold
2479,for a watch that is supposed to be helpful for sleep tracking it sure is dog shit to wake you up cover to mute disables alarm not snooze them so you just miss it if you ever so slightly brush your arm i wish i could return this terrible product did nobody at apple actually qa would the stupid thing
2480,the only minor flaw is next year ultra 2 paying 800dollar for a disposable watch no hate against disposable stuff but
2481,would love to see you do a full head to head against a high end garmin for sport a someone who cycle and run competitively this can not replace my garmin yet but if they can do another 2x battery improvement and allow me to hook up sensor now we are talking
2482,randall bakken you might be right but 800 dollar watch with only 36 hour battery is a joke
2483,mixed review same here
2484,mb one it is true i think garmin will win but if apple is serious about getting into the fitness game then doing head to head with each generation apple make would be neat to see if they make any inroad or if they are just interested in the casual hiker all of the cyclist and triathlon friend i have use garmin or wahoo but many use apple watch a a daily if that gap start to narrow even a bit they could probably be convinced to change
2485,i agree i had hope but garmin is still the one i am a long time fenix watch user
2486,garmin watch will win every time so there is no point of making head to head with apple watch
2487,it is the battery and screen size that sold me if the 8 had that battery amp screen size i would go with the 8 and not the ultra
2488,i have an idea what if the smarwatch us bracelet that can be connected and disconnected any though
2489,a second ultra video but no series 8 video
2490,i would love it if marquess could make an ultimate frisbee channel so we can see what he is like outside the office
2491,i am an endurance cyclist and i have both an apple watch for everyday use and a garmin fenix solar for trainig and workout i would have loved the apple watch ultra to replace the two device for someone like me but it is missing a few key feature 1 ant and bt le sensor connectivity for thing like my rear radar garmin varia unit or my power meter pedal 2 broadcast hr data to other device like my computer when i am doing indoor cycling on a turbo trainer like while using zwift or to a head unit on my bike when i cycle outdoors 3 more performance and training analytics like garmin connect doe which help guide your workout and training session to gauge your weekend load 4 a few more button in addition to the touchscreen like the fenix epix enduro since a constantly moving wrist make it hard to use a touchscreen soley not to mention sweaty or wet finger this is a great first iteration for apple to recruit someone like me full time to an apple watch but with those four reason above and a few more minor one i will have to wait to see what watch ultra 2 brings to the table
2492,i am in the boat of i want apple to make a larger round apple watch once they do that i will switch from my fossil watch i would also like it to be gold just saying
2493,i already an dollar800 garmin watch so but if there wa a dollar200 watch would more for me yes i run a 100 mile mile run and often to save my watch i will wear a music watch no big deal if i decide when i like music whan i can or maybe even play on my fancy watch ok i looked the feature a pretty cool just maybe a few close in the party
2494,that intro though dam
2495,jeez a garmin can go a whole month or what couple week on full use
2496,also stride tracking
2497,the best fitness tracker doe not even have a display all apple needed to do wa make the 8 slightly thicker for the battery charged 600 rather than 800 and called it a pro
2498,the se feel like a lite version like the lite version of apps i will always go for the regular series watch
2499,can not wait for the se video that might be my first watch
2500,i wan na get an apple watch which one should i get
2501,bruh who is the editor
2502,it is worthless for the ten and maybe hundred of million who have diabetes they can concentrate and make the glucose monitoring work if they want to no more watch for u until they make the glucose monitoring work
2503,guess i have to wear it on my right wrist now that it s so big
2504,marque brownlee how many hour do you put in a week on making content you are always working hard
2505,almost 3 day lol my huawei gt 3 pro last a whole week including workout and sleep tracking besides that it charge fast enough to keep it charged when charged a couple of minute each day when i shower
2506,how aboug samsung galaxy watch 5 pro
2507,this intro should be the apple watch commercial
2508,what happened to your hand look like you have had a surgery
2509,im afraid there will be not much change in apple watch and iphone is design
2510,i have always looked for way to ruggedize my series 6 fun fact i could not at least not without the help of an oversized watch band but now that the ultra is available ruggedized trying is unnecessary thank you apple
2511,apple advertises the ultra for extreme sportsman if i am going for 1 week in the middle of nowhere how on earth can 36 hour of battery be useful another mistake lie is that it is good for 100 mt underwater i have been scuba diving for over 40 year then they correct that for scuba it is only 40 mt it is 100 mt or 40 mt a brutal contradiction my garmin last 12 or more day without recharging and 100 mt depth in ocean that is a real sport watch
2512,great review have the haptics been upgraded to be more prominent
2513,if you are one of these people on the outside that doe not use an apple watch apple wa trying to find a reason you did not use it and add the feature or capability to make you actually want to use it that made me laugh i use a samsung phone and if apple would allow me to use an apple watch with it i would the only reason i do not use an apple watch is apple actively preventing me
2514,they named it the apple watch ultra since they are targeting ultra marathoner ultra triathlon athlete etc it resonates more with an athlete than the word pro my two cent
2515,dick tracy would approve
2516,i can see a market a real pro market for people who are making a living working in extreme condition like working on remote isolated location without reliable cellular service and there must be aplenty mining digging drilling foresting fishing
2517,how long doe it last without a phone just cellular with this watch
2518,if pro is for apple ultra is for samsung apple is using ultra to make people think that apple is a good a samsung i think mb what do you think of my opinion
2519,iphones airpods and ipads all do not require you to be a pro because we all know no one is shooting a movie with the iphone 14 pro
2520,on which wrist do you carry your watch it seems you are switching
2521,i am 14 and spent 95percent of my bank account on this also someone tell me why if i cancel and order a new one it say it come quicker i feel like my order timeline just ha not been updated
2522,se would work for u
2523,kinda funny how apple used samsung is ultra on this watch n samsung used apple is pro on their watch they done do a big switcheroo
2524,doe touch screen work underwater
2525,waiting for airpods pro 2 review from you do not really care to watch anyone else is video on it
2526,name make sense to me the pro label would be like the 8 with more feature this watch is a sport watch
2527,is it supposed to show 2000 cal or 2000kcal im confused my aw show 500 600kcal after just 40 min workout
2528,i am definitely not in the target demographic for this watch that said i would still buy it for the battery life alone i hate having to remember to charge my watch every day it would last at least 3 full day for me
2529,it is terrible it look like cheap chinese
2530,watch is worth but not suit on your wrist your wrist could have been better
2531,wtf 15 min video and zero ad
2532,earthly worldly material thing i would absolutely buy that if i have butt load of money reminder buy what you need not what you want i wanted that but i do not need that
2533,i do not own a single apple product but i still watch nearly every video of you hearing your opinion on new tech is great about watch and battery i have a casio with a 10 year battery which is running for 14 year now so for now i can not imagine getting a watch i need to charge daily also no watch for 800dollar damn
2534,that gad dayum sfx took me off guard i nearly spit my drink
2535,it aint no garmin
2536,not good at all i will consider such a device when it will have 2 week battery a band can do 80percent of the apple watch and it last 2 week no need to spend 800usd for a device to charge it daily when it is intended to be worn non stop no hate but still not developed a it should be
2537,i will wait till the battery life is at garmins level a week between charge would be good
2538,with the regular apple watch 8 or se could i get 2 day if i turn off always on display and use it lightly
2539,i get why some people love smartwatches but for me personally i would never buy one because they all look so stupid imo a watch is probably the most important part of an outfit to make it go from cool to awesome with the right watch and a smartwatch especially not from the major phone company never look good if you ask me
2540,it look nice overall but still ha way to go in order to catch up with garmin for example when it get to the specific function for specific user group still a nice device for sure
2541,i still have my garmin saphire solar ha all these apps and more and the battery last a week of full use i want an apple watch but even their premium doe not stand up to other smart watch
2542,great review well done one thing that you did not mention that is important to me is that the battery is replaceable for dollar99 but otherwise without applecare the cost of any other repair is out of sight i am getting an ultra but despite the fact that it is big and a bit of bling it ha the feature and ruggedness that every smartwatch and the other apple watch should have i own an apple watch 6 gps while functioning a a little iphone on your wrist cellular i have a cardiac condition want 911 calling everywhere longer battery life resistance to high pressure water my sprinkler system when i work on it and supposedly better temperature resistance i will see how it last outside in 106 deg f texas heat i like to go hiking so the more accurate gps under tree cover or in big city where did i park my car etc is a plus too for such an expensive watch it is a shame if it eventually obsoleted by not being upgradeable to a future watchos five year or so would be a pretty limited lifetime for a good watch
2543,well i do not need a smartwatch but if i really wanted a watch to monitor my workout i would just get a casio under 200euros with a battery life of 2 year in combination with my phone thats just fine but 800euros for a watch i do not get it
2544,any apple watch vid since met gala mkbhd did i tell u i went to the met gala w my all black apple watch much love man been watching your vids it feel like since forever huge fan keep up the great work
2545,this i a fake ad for apple this guy get all the item for free in order to praise them to the sky fake shame on you
2546,that intro by 20syl make me feel nostalgic
2547,how would you get that scar on your hand
2548,shocking to me apple top smartwatch ha some great feature with the increased size but they sacrifice the battery life a top end smartwatch should have for example garmin top watch speak about battery in length of day not 2 night 2 day if that make sense my current garmin fenix ha not been charged in two day and i have literally 28 day of battery left lol
2549,middle of nowhere oh man you got ta go on a real hike
2550,yeah still sticking with my fenix
2551,wow that thing is huge look like the ipad of apple watch strapped to your wrist way too bulky
2552,my huawei in titanium watch last 5 day and way cheaper than apple overpriced junk
2553,smart watch are just overrated
2554,man pls tell size of your wrist i can not try on a this watch but i can compare with you
2555,marque thanks for the in depth video i have had every apple watch from the beginning and trade phone about every year some people spend their money on car boat motorcycle etc i spend mine on watch and phone used to be android and now apple my wife love me and i love her but sometimes the watch and phone thing drive her crazy enough about that got my iphone pro max and apple watch 8 by preorder on launch day and replaced an iphone 13 pro and watch 7 i have been giving the thought to returning my watch 8 and ordering the ultra simply because i worry about swimming in a pool with my regular apple watch so i have been watching the spec and review on the ultra and yours wa the best my big issue with the ultra v the 8 is the size and the ability to dress it up since i wear a suit for work everyday so you answered a lot of question i had and have probably come to the conclusion i am better off with the series 8 thanks
2556,69percent battery nice mkbhd 2022
2557,hey man do you think you can do a review of an acer aspire xc 840 it will help out on buying it
2558,hehe you put your best catch on frisbee nice dive rodman style
2559,look cool even on a thin wrist
2560,is this useful a a soldier
2561,i saw u at apple park with tech burner love from india
2562,i am just your average joe that like tech mine will be here mid october
2563,your video is awesome
2564,ok doe this watch come just gps are we forced to get a line for it
2565,2 day and 2 night of battery life lmfao that is really not that great
2566,gahh damn
2567,nah ultra is perfect
2568,intro music
2569,i am not an apple user and i do not care for smart watch but i got ta say i like the look of the ultra despite it being overkill for me if android compatibility wa there i would probably save up for one
2570,thanks for explain this tool bro
2571,for me a watch must be something we never want to taken care of but something we can rely upon all the time the real not so smart watch remaining that way for long time it the core of timekeeping there is a lot of people need a smart watch with even long battery life atleast a week how a smart watch becomes smart when it need your attention in every two day it just a wearable health band not a real watch apple can add their pro tag when they found a solution for this problem
2572,another piece of crap from apple for isheeps
2573,heck nah it an accessory an extra a non repairable toy are people getting crazy 350 dollar euro max and that is pushing it
2574,problem with apple watch is it need an iphone for over 80percent of the apps plus a apple is music based not having the speaker on the watch to listen to music on the go without a bluetooth headset make the watch sort of useless
2575,what happened to ur right hand
2576,yeah yeah i am buying the watch but my question is what happened to la roux
2577,what happened to the glucose sensor and why doe the watch go full ultra maga with a red screen it is just like a red hat
2578,a someone in the hiking group and slightly in the running and cycling group this doe not cover what i want from it and will stay with my garmin had an apple watch before curious now how these people would use the watch that it would fit
2579,noticing that mkbhd is wearing this watch on his right wrist but also writing with his right hand do not be one of those wrong wrist guy
2580,this watch ha an absolutely enormous pull for me a an astronomer it ha a red filter for the display which is absolutely crucial for astronomy to protect night vision my current apple watch if i accidentally tilt my wrist kill my night vision however the biggest reason is the waypoint marker often u astronomer need to travel far and to remote location to find darker sky my closest dark sky area is beautiful but ha absolutely zero signal of any degree and can be pretty easy to get lost something like the waypoint marker if accurate and reliable would massively increase my confidence and enjoyment traveling to remote site and further my enjoyment of astronomy
2581,no watch from apple google or samsung will be viable for me until they drastically increase their battery life my tic watch pro 3 ultra get me 5 7 day on a single charge and the competition doe not even come close i wish company would focus on battery life for a change and le on gimmicky feature that i will probably use once and then never touch again
2582,wow that is a big watch kinda look like it would survive quite a bit of punishment
2583,a teammate of mine brought up a great point for u runner do we want a running endurance watch with smart feature or a smart watch with running endurance feature many of u will still fall in that first category my garmin fenix 5 still ha 7 day of battery despite being almost 5 year old
2584,you can not anodize titanium
2585,this mean they going to have a new iphone ultra is the next few year
2586,if anyone still listen to this reviewer come frisbee player they are lost you only need to hear the podcast he reference to see how much of a shill he is become for apple
2587,no chance it is worth dollar800 but the phone ai not worth dollar1k so
2588,it doe look le and le like a watch
2589,14 04 if your wrist are big enough and your pocket deep enough
2590,what keyboard is that 2 20
2591,thanks for the video what about the heart rate zone is it accurate how doe it work
2592,hey marque what size wrist do you have for reference thx
2593,this will not replace my whoop for triathlons it is too expensive and too big
2594,review for new apple watch se please
2595,i really wish they had included something for pilot but that is just me
2596,i do not know for those who live in a poorer country paying the same a a 2005 used car on a watch will always seem absurd
2597,800dollar for a stupid watch
2598,majority of people doe not need it professional can not use it bilionaires will not buy it so bacically it is for no one
2599,what is your wrist size
2600,the apple watch ultra is nice but for people with bigger wrist if they make a smaller version that would fit people with skinny wrist speaking of pro apple decided to call this the ultra because the ultra is not the highest price apple watch they make if they going to call this a pro and it is only dollar799 then might a well call the hermes edition a pro because it start at dollar1229 so yeah they can not call the ultra a pro
2601,watch wa so far from his wrist he could wear a two apple watch
2602,middle of nowhere
2603,would have preferred an apple watch 8 with a better battery life ultra is a niche segment a normal user may not be interested in majority of the ultra feature except battery life
2604,for yor notice huawei gt watch battery life is one week to two week which you can forget to charge your watch everyday
2605,still wearing my apple watch 4 and it still work for me
2606,doe it have a keyboard like the 7 series
2607,am i the only 1 who got 5 ad during video
2608,i am not an apple fan boy but objectively i say that i find it very beautiful since i like big bulky masculine watch i thought the dollar499 galaxy watch5 pro wa expensive so i ordered the regular watch5 but now that i see this apple watch is dollar799 it make the watch5 pro seem like a bargain so yes i ordered two of them and i get them next week
2609,0 09 god damn
2610,69percent nice
2611,overpriced af
2612,where ud get that stiches on hand dude i wonder
2613,nah
2614,the biggest problem i have with this watch is that you can not wear it on the inside of your wrist people who wear there watch for a professional reason pilot prefer to have them inside the wrist it is easier faster and more ergonomic to read
2615,is it bad that while i am a pro user on most of apple device but do not need any of the watch ultra it feature but i still will get it co i wan na
2616,the smallest aw still feel large to me i can not imagine walking around with this clock on a wrist unless i absolutely required it i want the watch to be a unobtrusive a possible charging every day is a pain in the neck but i have gotten used to it
2617,ultra why did not mkbhd state that samsung ha been calling their flagship device ultra for year
2618,a a watch person the sapphire crystal is imperative and it is only available on the stainless steel version so the price of the ultra need to be compared to the stainless steel version or better yet the last titanium version with that understood i think the only decision would be whether you think this watch look comically big on your wrist or not a everything else make the ultra a 100percent worth it
2619,next is solar
2620,can not wait for my ultra to come in i am an avid mountain biker a lot of place i mountain bike my apple watch gps could not pick up anymore gps signal this is a game changer for outdoor enthusiast like myself
2621,apple sangi
2622,epix 2 garmin
2623,i charge my fitbit once a week
2624,best tech reviewer on the planet
2625,i love this watch i got an inexpensive cover and screen protector to protect it while i am working and playing i also love that i will not have to charge it every day like my s7 or older series apple watch and and and it is beautiful to look at the screen is amazing it ha way more to offer than any of my other smart watch i will be selling them lol
2626,nate horlick how do you not know it is not out yet
2627,how do you know it is not out yet
2628,my fitbit last 6days
2629,should i finally upgrade from the original apple watch that doe not even hold a charge for a full day if i am tracking literally anything haha
2630,i think a lot of review are not taking into account the extra durability of the sapphire screen and titanium case for everyday worker i am in the life safety industry and something that hold up to more abuse is something that i need
2631,nah
2632,the watch is impressive but nothing compared to your video production quality congrats
2633,somebody should make a tapered solar charging band that look more substantial for this watch and keep it charged using the sun
2634,what happened to your hand
2635,some people will buy just to show off
2636,you mentioned a depth rating of 100 meter but i believe you meant 40 meter
2637,you are using the wrong band when you compared it to the g shock between minute 5 6
2638,but i am adventurous people lying to themselves to justify the purchase
2639,there are some people who will never be fully into apple watch at the end of the day a watch can be more trouble than it is worth to have on all day and people who always carry their phone on them will not also feel like wearing a watch i fall into this camp
2640,apple is smart we are stupid i will never buy apple again not because i do not have the money but because i do not want to be stupid anymore
2641,why are you comparing the battery life of the ultra to a standard wristwatch like a casio obviously a wristwatch s battery life will last longer
2642,completely agreed with the pro moniker portion and a for the black or space grey option it will just be one more device that apple can create yet another version of the color that doe not match any of the other device you may have that are space grey insert eyeroll
2643,look good on you actually maybe just need to get used to the size
2644,bro my brand new laptop only cost a flipping dollar90 and it is a second handed one too
2645,is the display flippable so that the crown can be on the left for ppl who prefer to where the watch on right wrist
2646,i am just curious what size is your wrist so i can have an estimate of how it would fit on me
2647,20syl
2648,dive app only work too 40 meter so it is water spec are basically pointless
2649,that intro is sick
2650,i love this idea and i am a 2 phone guy do you ever think apple will allow u to connect an apple watch to android phone
2651,your voice absolutely doe not match your body in any shape form or fashion
2652,i am a pretty active outdoors kinda guy and while this apple wearable personally is not worth it to me in comparison to the rugged watch in my collection it is worth it to those it is worth it to when the apple wearable can function independent from the iphone i will give it a look then
2653,iphone phhroow macbook phhroow i love you man nohomo keep going
2654,i use huawei watch gt2 mainly use it for time notification activity monitoring alarm always on heart rate monitoring and sleep monitoring also the phone camera trigger logging every imaginable aspect of my outdoor running controlling the music playback spotify on my phone or computer plus occasionally the other smaller feature of the watch and the battery last 2 week easy if i do not use gps tracking for the workout and turn off the constant heart rate monitoring i bet it could go for a month on a single charge if i would have to charge a smartwatch every 2 day i would not even be using it even more so for a one battery life you could not even monitor your sleep if you had to charge it every night absolute stupidity
2655,and it only cost 170 usd new 2 year ago not 6 or 800
2656,brilliant review
2657,absolutely no way this is worth double that of a series 8
2658,a a child i dreamed of a computer on my wrist i love it
2659,can i have your old apple watch please
2660,i just think it crazy apple sell a 60hz display phone for 900 buck in 2022
2661,the video are getting longer and le crisp
2662,god that intro damn
2663,a a skateboarder i wonder if this one will not break on me i have broken 1 gshock and 2 apple watch while skateboarding how tough is this apple watch
2664,1000 euro embarrassing
2665,in italy
2666,ultra versus pro name wa a waste of time
2667,so i have to spend dollar800 to finally get decent sleep tracking apple tech is so trash but their marketing is so elegant please please please buy these my aapl need your lift
2668,i had to say it is good smartwatch but the price is nah
2669,2 day but with cinema theater mode on
2670,i rather go for coros vertix 2 or garmin fenix compared to apple watch ultra lol
2671,the watch should go on the left wrist
2672,se lineup will be the next re branded normal version the now regular version will be re branded a the pro series and the ultra will be ultra apple is way of re branding in the future just like iphone 11
2673,i did not see you at the met gala
2674,would you be able to do a comparison of garmin epix 2 v apple watch ultra or in general the garmin epix 2
2675,wow a whole 2 day of battery life really guy it is not worth it
2676,i think this might finally be a watch that could allow me to get rid of my phone completely i have an ipad for home
2677,why do you wear your watch on different arm at random point in the day most people wear their watch on one arm left if you are right handed and right if you are left handed couple of time you had it on your left arm my garmin fenix 5x will go for a week on a battery charge i hate apple watch but mostly because i hate apple and i hate square watch
2678,never would have worn an apple watch the battery is in a word horrendous that said they got me my ultra come on monday
2679,it is ugly it is expensive it is targeting a niche in a niche and missed the much larger market of people who want long battery life with sleep tracking
2680,it is ugly af though
2681,i really miss any comparison to the garmin epix 2
2682,and once again i just wish this came in black
2683,another useless novelty from apple
2684,mkbhd please can i have an iphone
2685,the intro trying to outdo apple or did someone steal an apple employee
2686,fun fact samsung going for watch 5 pro amp apple going for ultra
2687,in the intro the airpod battery sound got me
2688,saw him in captain phillips amazing actor
2689,nah
2690,people here in the comment section are acting like this is a blessing in life constructor and worker are like ohh so useful for me n all it is 900dollar and ai not nothing good but just to flash
2691,a a dad and an apple watch 4 owner i am concerned that my son will think he can also make a living being a youtuber and a frisbee thrower
2692,for 800 usd you can buy an actual watch with actual heritage this garbage will last for a couple of year
2693,nah
2694,that watch is too big for his wrist
2695,emergency satellite communication that iphone 14 ha
2696,odd watch wearing habit below your wrist bone instead of above
2697,hint hint maybe next september it is gon na be iphone 15 ultras and mac ultra range
2698,lol garmin watch 2 week batterylife try harder apple
2699,i personally like large face watch still love my stainless steel series 4 although old and the battery is not what it used to be this 49mm look awesome to me if you went with aw ultra you better get applecare with this the repair to this watch are insanely expensive also the problem with apple watch and many smart watch is the battery will die even bulge eventually which happened to my original aw1 now apple may replace the battery aka send you a replacement watch for dollar79 or charge you a lot more and charge you far more than the watch is worth trade in is with aw is are abysmal also you may drop dollar399 on a regular aw7 8 and the value of that the following year will plummet 60 70percent older series may be worth 10 buck or apple will give dollar0 00 except the offer for them to recycle it for you will ultra drop 40 60 70percent in value next year a a trade in no idea
2700,probably you got the apple watch ultra for free from apple so you have to give a good review i am waiting next year to buy the new ultra i hope they do a nike plus
2701,it could definitely be black and rugged look at the garmin watch
2702,you do not need an apple watch ultra to run a regular 42km marathon it doe not take that long at all 4hrs or le
2703,maybe they are taking a dig at samsung by calling their watch ultra a in our watch is better than your flagship ultra phone
2704,if it cost more than my phone then nah
2705,i noticed you are right handed and you wear the watch on your right hand a well did it size get in the way of any of your activity or make it harder to throw a frisbee accurately etc doe throwing a frisbee ever trigger the fall detection
2706,fuckapple
2707,the hell with this trash get a real watch
2708,ultramarathons pardon me but to run for more than 24h with gps and all the tracking on i do not think this watch could do that even my garmin fenix 6 pro need charging the 2nd day of that heavy use so no it for not for endurance sport period it still for city jogger who are lazy to charge their watch every night
2709,bru got a macbook on his arm bigger than a 80 inch tv
2710,i have always wondered how marque got his right hand scar
2711,how rugged is the ultra i am in maintenance and work with machine and outside work can it stand up to a beating i now have a series 5 in a rhino watch case wanted to upgrade but want to know if it can handle a blue collar worker i do go to the gym daily and do driving but only 2 3 time a year so that would not justify
2712,so maybe there will be the apple watch pro this one is going for garmin the pro will be for the poser
2713,probably you got the apple watch ultra for free from apple so you have to give a good review i am waiting next year to buy the new ultra i hope they do a nike plus
2714,do a vid on the se
2715,man the intro
2716,that is a pretty gnarly scar on your right hand
2717,i can not justify spending 800 dollar after spending 1k on the pro can not see the worth in it
2718,apple watch know it my heart problem now the watch check all the time even i forget it so not just for sport for health too he think just sport made it this watch but like people too
2719,nice review look forward the diving review in coming day
2720,the feature mean nothing to me if it is not comfortable to wear i am not out doing extreme sport though so maybe that is irrelevant to some but i tend to buy apple best product anyway amp i will not buy this watch for the fitment alone
2721,are you left handed
2722,for cyclops no doubt
2723,man these intro are so good
2724,dope animation
2725,is look like cheap chinese smart watch
2726,proabaly pro here mean professional people who use their product for productivity not everyday use
2727,mkbhd what is that scar on your hand for ultimate frisbee injury
2728,shit reviewer
2729,i am just here for the animation for real they keep getting better and better
2730,the second i saw this watch i knew i wanted it i do not like the bulbous glass on the normal one i whack it on thing quite often and the crystal doe chip and even delaminate when you hit it a fast glancing blow on the normal watch learned that the hard way
2731,okay this intro wa fuckin sick lol
2732,it is nice but we are about to hit a recession so yeah no
2733,dollar800 and only 2 day battery lol
2734,still waiting for that one video one day where he us the og intro song
2735,sound like they just taking advantage of samsung is note s22 23 ultimate the best way possible
2736,can you compare garmin v apple
2737,2023 apple watch studio
2738,i have been waiting to get an apple watch because they have been way too small for my large wrist so finally i can wear one yay
2739,using the watch on the right hand is a cardinal sin fuck off
2740,two plus day of battery life what i do not need the ultra but i might get it just for the battery life alone
2741,i have been a dive master for 7 year and i had always hoped that apple would had dive capability to the apple watch i currently use a shearwater teric which is a very robust dive computer and i will wear it a my primary watch when out of country it is much larger then my apple watch so i am very interested in getting the ultra in hand to see how it feel on wrist one thing i wa very interested in wa air integration a it is a very useful feature on my teric however according to oceanic air integration is not part of the feature set of the oceanic app at this time you mentioned it wa something the ultra is capable of but currently this is not the case air integration is when the watch can receive data from a transmitter attached to the 1st stage regulator that can give you cylinder tank air pressure i would certainly love this feature added to the ultra a i am sure many diver would so i thought i would clarify for all my diver friend out there
2742,black cerakote finish on that would look great
2743,this very intrigue me legit training for a marathon and my apple watch will not make it the whole time ran 13 mile last week and it wa done to 10percent after the run which is very frustrating i love tracking my mile m heart rate during my run
2744,how do you know what size to buy
2745,i think you wa at the table when apple wa putting this watch together or at least a fly on the wall keep teaching bro we keep turning in
2746,that circle you drew represents your belongs owning you
2747,did the apple watch showed any emergency message when you jumped for that frisbee or because you were recording the activity it just ignored the sudden run fall
2748,ah the irony of a black person driving a car built by child and slave labor classic
2749,69percent noice a fellow man of culture
2750,way too over priced for a watch that doe not even have a 7 day battery
2751,skinny wrist gang
2752,i am a big guy big guy need big accessory i like apple watch but they look small on my wrist i have been waiting for this
2753,a an ultra runner and an alpinist i have been waiting for this watch for quite some time i love my series 7 but would have to put it in theater mode to extend the life over my ultras and even then it would die soon after the end of the run i wa about to order a garmin when i got wind that apple wa making a watch for ultra athlete they knocked it out of the park for the ultra athlete with this watch for alpine setting we frequently get an alpine start when summiting a big mountain start around midnight and climb all night to try and catch the sunrise this extended battery life red filter and waypoints are perfect for big mountain the only thing missing which i am sure will make it in the future is the emergency satellite communication that iphone 14 ha
2754,gesture while i see this watch competing well with the top tier garmin model out there cheaper one will still have their place
2755,i went on holiday for 8 night with my garmin venu 2 plus and did not have to charge it once 2 3 day of battery life is not that great
2756,interesting wan na buy one
2757,love the editing
2758,pre smart watch suunto used to refer to their watch a a wristtop computer
2759,my g shock last longer amp tougher than these pro watch seriously no joke it could even survive nuclear fallout
2760,can we see an apple watch pro
2761,do not know how it worth it for diver or substitute for dive computer even a normal budget dive watch is like 150 meter typically 200m water resistance twice the apple watch i would not say it great for diver
2762,not for me a i fall into the group that the regular series 8 cover however this ultra give an insight a to what is to come from apple watch in the not too distant future
2763,hey marque would love some help figuring out how to get an external mic to my sony rx 100 vi camera without needing to sync audio in post from an audio recorder can not find this done properly on youtube anywhere i have searched man i am thinking maybe an adaptor micro hdmi or usb c to audio female 3 5 mm thought appreciate it know you are a busy man
2764,that little clip introducing the watch incredible
2765,what an intro actually make the viewer more interested in watching the rest of the video love it
2766,can you also review the movie rrr
2767,the paper concept wa great
2768,i can get a laptop and a smartphone on that price
2769,the thing is the other watcher arnt really smart watch so oviously they last longer
2770,this watch is only for shaq o neal
2771,cool
2772,hopefully by the time i have enough money saved back for this thing they will have it in more color option
2773,them to make it one color is great for selling though because then you do not have to deal with customer who want it specific i like that it is one color
2774,i feel like apple really missed an opportunity by not marketing this specifically to hunter far more hunter doing remote backpacking trip in the mountain than regular hiker every ounce matter on multi day backpacking trip and more importantly you can sell the idea to the huge casual hunting market who would buy this just in case they end up drawing an elk tag in the next few year i like they catered to a bunch of small community niche activity but you are missing out on an audience of ten of million just in the u
2775,samsung owns the term watch pro
2776,my amazfit gts 2 mini last 2 week with the same usage my apple watch se the new one last 1 day it is battery life is absolutely horrible
2777,black are afraid of water you are not alone
2778,i could get a fitbit for 200 and it will last longer
2779,you will understand mkbhd more if you listen to his waveform podcast
2780,wa not the old titanium and ceramic apple watch more than dollar800 while it is not for me i think that this watch is underpriced compared to old apple watch line
2781,3 hour 2k cal impossible
2782,wow new button take my money honestly apple watch are lovely but why are people paying these price they could honestly stick anything on that price tag an moron pay it probably cost about dollar80 to build
2783,what is sleep tracking for
2784,100 meter of water resistance doe not mean that you can dive 100 meter underwater but it mean 100 meter of water pressure which mean you can barely go snorkelling with this watch but for diving you go for 200 meter of water resistance and for scuba diving you go for 300 meter of water resistance
2785,that is a debate for another day
2786,apple watch cause hand cancer
2787,here is the thing of course it will not be worth it for most people they advertised it for the extreme athlete and it only for them
2788,yeah but why the feck is the ultra 800dollar in the usa and 1000euros in italy i could understand up to 50 60euros increase due to taxation fee and sheesh
2789,tveni percent is meh but twenty percent is good
2790,i mean oh my god the production quality
2791,when they bring a black version of this out then i will get that
2792,do they make case for the watch because i race motocross so i need something that is going to handle a lottttt
2793,maybe dbrand can make a skin for apple watch ultra
2794,it is about 15 min video i get to know that this watch is not for me damn i love that but yeah that is it good review well tell me a thing hypothetically someday apple include some feature in there device which you are not capable of to test it in a real world is not that apple make your job tuff
2795,you should test it on the golf course is it more accurate with the additional gps for distance apple watch range finder about the same price a apple watch ultra plus the other bonus feature you get with the best watch apple make
2796,moto edge 30 ultra review bro
2797,wearing a watch on wrong hand
2798,no
2799,do you think this would be a useful tool for a sailor navigation speed direction intensity and weather alert would be fairly important
2800,i will be keeping my 7
2801,i thought about it for many day and finally came to the decision to order a mechanical watch the explorer ii model 2022 although it cost more than ten time a much and the waiting time is 8 month my concessi but it will have at least the same price in ten year probably a much higher resale value that is ok for me i saved some time on that
2802,well if you take the stainless steel regular watch or the ultra i go for ultra price wise it is pretty clear choice
2803,who the f wear a watch on his right wrist tha fuck
2804,i am sorry it look great but an apple watch ha never excited me in anyway shape or form
2805,black anodized and other color are coming with the apple watch pro ultra maybe ultra pro in a year or two
2806,i have no idea who the heck edit your video but please say congrats from my side
2807,doe this apple watch ultra work for tattoed people
2808,smartwatch are dumb when apple released a watch you sitting there scrolling like an idiot pretending that it is useful lmao it b it rubbish people be like it track my heart rate lol you went through your life not knowing your heart rate you never knew how many step you took lol and when apple released this b everyone is pretending that it is useful lol rubbish
2809,doe it have whatsapp
2810,800 00 dollers you can keep it
2811,hearing voice by 20syl come up and knowing that there will be an epic intro sequence is just so you keep up the great work marque and co
2812,i wait for his intro always
2813,cool but it is hella ugly
2814,man that intro is even better than apple comercials
2815,not to mention the fenix 7 is solar a well
2816,whatever happened to elegantly understated brick watch plus brick iphone clunk
2817,garmin fenix 7 thank you
2818,so much tech and it still can not give me turn by turn navigation for trail running hiking exploring
2819,2 20 mkbh yo i need some cool animation showing how many people will use the ultra video editor i am on vacay mkbdh ok i will do it myself then
2820,i wan na know how much editor work for mkbhd make
2821,the reason the apple watch ultra is not reliable a what if you got stuck in a forest while hiking pressed the buzzer so and everything and no help came for 36 48 hour then what how this watch will save your life in some extreme rescue mission people get rescued after day with this watch out of battery good luck with the bear in jungle b this watch specifically say to carry a backup device while diving yeah of course unless they make a watch with at least last up to a week i do not see a point using it a your extreme adventure companion
2822,i wish they would copy whoop with an attachable charger so i could charge it while sleeping on my wrist my whoop ha not left my wrist once since i put it on
2823,mkbhd what is up with ur hand
2824,i thought that wa will smith
2825,to help you out with the reason why there is no black ultra apple watch hard metallic surface such a titanium are not good candidate for painted finish if you brush or spray paint directly over titanium surface heavy flaking and peeling will ensue apple could anodize titanium but that will just make it blue or purple there is something called black titanium but you do not want to know the cost of that thing i do not think 800dollar would cover that production price
2826,ok ummm there are more issue in the video scuba diver will not use that apple watch 100m is not nearly enough for scuba diving not alone saturation diving 200m is like standard minimum for that 100m is for recreational diving or just snorkeling but i would just avoid going into deep on longer period with a 100m watch of any kind with no screw down crown that cost 800dollar uff people are gon na have a bad time with their ultra watch after this video it is really not a pro watch that is why they call it ultra pro name would confuse real professional and they would lose watch in water with low wr or experience battery death 2 day into 5 day hike in wild and what not
2827,13 13 son heung min much
2828,hey nice chase down to snag the frisby mkbhd lol at the post catch swagg that is how to bounce up like it is just routine
2829,but the intro wa lazy
2830,the true intro start at 38sec
2831,note i believe the diving certification is en13319 reason for this comment is this a aregular 100m water resistance rating on any other watch mean you can swim with it but not dive watch that only label a water resistance in meter or bar are not suitable to be used to those depth believe it or not so to those who may be confused this watch ha a diving certification not the aregular 100m water resistance rating you often find on your wristwatch
2832,not bad but battery still is not good enough compared to my garmin watch
2833,oh we do love a mkbhd intro
2834,if you run a 100 miler or somethimg longer it gon na be garmin and coros if your gon na go to a starbucks it gon na be the apple watch
2835,there still is not any way to switch from apple watch to apple watch in an easy way is there this would make me more interested in buying a more specialized apple watch ultra if i could switch back and forth with ease and not lose my data thank you love the content
2836,tech user reviewer etc big company are not going to make product for a niche group of people apple hold my beer
2837,these video are such high quality it insane
2838,found somebody else who wear the watch on his right wrist marquee you can rotate the watch 180 degree and then you can use the crown much easier with your left hand no accidental button pressing
2839,ultramarathon alpine scuba watch ultra test video let is gooooo
2840,ultimate frisbee practice
2841,fitness track stuff is so bloated stats are not accurate just are not
2842,cute drawing
2843,wow

2845,there is a proper definition of pro it is do you get the majority of your income from the activity you are a pro youtuber
2846,mkbhd wa batman in his privious life
2847,nah
2848,let is be real must buyer will be like me lazy and think we will go more outside once we buy an outdoorsy watch
2849,saw his scar for the first time curious what really happened
2850,super
2851,video top
2852,top
2853,the look is not good enough other function do not matter
2854,he forgot the people that can actually afford it and always need to latest apple stuff
2855,yo yo
2856,i have a series 5 and wa looking to finally upgrade this generation but had no idea there wa an ultra in the work the main reason i preordered it instead of the series 8 is for the longer battery life and how rugged it is i wa looking at garmin too for their super long battery life but i like the lte with the apple watch a that is only available like on one garmin model
2857,durmd
2858,totndbxhx
2859,dhdhdhbd
2860,supldjd
2861,it is a hobbyist weekend warrior watch which is a sweet spot
2862,in serbia it cost 406dollar more then in usa
2863,dude your intro
2864,love the old school music for the intro always super cool to hear it with this chanel
2865,1 59 the pro mean professional marque ffs only someone with a profession can pay for these item you dummy
2866,that watch is huge
2867,i get 2 day out of my sasmung watch 4 classic half the price
2868,okay that video intro wa fantastic
2869,top
2870,most important if you know there is a high chance of you bump somewhere and brake a normal iwatch why would anyone not play safe and choose this one a grant more chance of not need buy another one soon
2871,title getting lazier
2872,why can not i download these video to watch later offline
2873,top video bro
2874,maybe it is a good idea to share the aw is tracking feature with emergency service or other people to be able to follow your track instead of wasting time searching a way to get to you the one that show you how to go back the way you came
2875,serum
2876,super duper
2877,are you going to do the galaxy watch 5
2878,super
2879,ask yourselves do you really need all this latest technology and fancy gadget
2880,love from india bro
2881,best
2882,nice video
2883,i would buy it if they offered it in black that colour is a no go for me waiting for more colour option
2884,have you ever worn a smart watch while having sex
2885,a someone that doe absolutely nothing this watch will ensure i can track how little i do i am only buying it for the flex which will match with the other flex in my life
2886,it is an interesting marketing approach for apple but a smart one the extreme end of sport is certainly a clever area in which to hinge a product i guess apple would have always ended up here but a someone that is never bought an apple watch and ha been waiting for the pro rugged version i dunno to me this is something else i wear a g shock have not changed the battery in 10 year and it is nice that you mention the taper of these sort of watch i dig the plastic and the way they shape your wrist they are also indestructible i am not sure what i actually expect apple to do because an apple watch surely doe a lot more than a g shock in term fitness health and feature the ultra still come across a precious to me a sport watch should have way better battery life durability and perhaps a cooler style before it will be on my radar
2887,there is a possibility that there will still be an apple watch pro fashionable and upscale but not rugged
2888,u did not mention the pipboy lmao jk
2889,ha nobody here heard of the garmin epix it blow the apple watch out of the water except for one thing it is not in the apple ecosystem but still having owned both i sticked with the epix because of the 2 week battery life with always on display very accurate metric the button all the available information in widget and not almost everybody already wear a garmin epix unlike a apple watch
2890,could you review something like the garmin fenix 7 for comparison
2891,i never wanted an apple watch because i prefer a chunky watch this is the first one i have wanted from an aesthetic point of view just need chunky wide leather band to come out now
2892,intro should have their own separate channel like noww
2893,think about the most popular swiss made watch rolex submariner is a diver watch but is rarely worn diving load of people wear chronograph and do not know what a tachymeter is and even fewer use their tachy to measure speed all of these feature though useful in edge case are justification for purchase if you spend gbp8 000 on a watch you would better be able to justify it to your peer 99percent of ultra user will unknowingly fall into this cool watch though
2894,just got the iphone 14 pro max and i am glad that my hauwei gt 3 pro watch actually work with it the battery on this thing last a week and it actually look like a watch too plus i do not want to be sucked into the apple ecosystem too much
2895,they should do the same with the iphones
2896,it is up against the fenix which ha much stronger exercise feature for cycling my thing and an excellent battery i guess if your thing is diving it is worth a look great first attempt but i will wait for the next iteration
2897,i notice the keyboard your using in this video whats the name of the keyboard i want to check it also and buy if it good
2898,awesome review
2899,i think the best way is to have a chip under your skin man why the f you need a watch like this i understand if you do sport and u have like garmin or other but watch like this you can throw it to bin sorry my english is not good but fu this watch
2900,red mode filter can be enabled by apple for all apple watch series why they mentioned it a a new feature it is only software i am normal apple watch user and hiker i prefer slim and beautiful look of regular apple watch this ultra is too big
2901,apple is notorious for great battery efficiency when the product is new be it iphone 13 pro max or the watch or airpods
2902,it is so much fun to see apple user happy because they do not have to charged the watch every day lol
2903,is not worth spending so much money on a watch that you do not need to many option
2904,hmm you wear your watch on your right hand interesting
2905,great video nice intro
2906,the watch is delusional bro burning 2000 calorie in 3 hour
2907,a a couch potato this is not for me although i would love a larger screen regular apple watch
2908,at the end he said fun fact amp then proceeded to give an opinion
2909,give the person on the motion graphic a cookie
2910,the production and motion graphic in the intro on a next level ive got to admit mkbhd never fails to make me watch the intro of a video again and again
2911,definitely a great addition to a regular dive computer having a lte and gps device with you on a dive add a huge amount of safety imagine you can send a distress call right after surfacing an apple watch only make sense if i can dive with it that is what i always thought now it is here
2912,and just to be clear it is an lte so not satellite you must have your iphone 14 in a dive housing out of the water with you for that
2913,the subscription is indeed a bummer i did not see that in the beginning would be totally ok to pay for the app but yearly no way i stick to my open source dive computer and analog watch
2914,unfortunately it can not be dive computer now and once ocean will go out you still have to pay subscription
2915,the trick is you kept it in theater mode clever it is not ultra you have to put it in theater mode to last that long
2916,best intro everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2917,i have the luck to never be pregnant
2918,what i really want to see is someone diving with it and using the dive computer
2919,2000 calorie for 3 5 hour of working out dude i am trying to eat like 1200 cal a day i am very sedimentary and trying to lose weight at the same time i miss food
2920,very expensive if it is 350dollor then it ok for me
2921,worst watch
2922,middle of nowhere
2923,another review justifying apple is action
2924,can u compare it with the samsung galaxy watch 5 pro because i want to know which one i will buy
2925,a someone who worked below minimum wage this is useless
2926,look pretty good i would wear it
2927,idea waveform ultimate a channel for highlight from some of your game also i am sure i missed it previously but what is the story with the stitch
2928,do not get me wrong maybe it is good but it is still 800dollar watch thats sick price so they give you crap 7 8 series wont last a day for le and good watch for crazy amount of money so basically they should add something in between le software and better battery it more thick then standard 7 8 material from series 8 size series 8 and the end price would be slightly above standard series 8 and le to ultra
2929,dude burned 2k calorie which is how much you are supposed to eat in a day he can eat 4k calorie and stay the same weight
2930,1 34 apparently they could not name it pro because lg already ha a watch pro and they did not want a lawsuit
2931,i have the series 4 and used it everyday including sleep tracking and yes i have to charge it a soon a i get home from work and when i wake up the new low power mode make it last a lot longer which is a bonus especially since the battery health is at 83percent now this new apple watch ultra battery is amazing but also heap more expensive i think apple should improve the battery life for the regular apple watch it would make it more attractive
2932,pro professional for productivity where a ultra go all the way out to extreme activity
2933,the suv of watch ultra is for everyone brand like the north face have proven that
2934,that beautiful lego bonsai in the background
2935,how is this even a review absolute clickbait
2936,bro comparing ordinary watch battery v apple watch battery constantly did not even review essential feature disliked
2937,duuuude that intro
2938,man the notch on the iphone 14 pro max sure stick into the video lmao
2939,which transparent low profile keyboard is he using
2940,i have been using a huawei watch gt2 for the last couple of year it doe not have all the function of android or apple but i get my notification and can answer or decline phonecalls and it also show the time but the battery life is just insane i get a full week with always on display last night when i came home around 5pm i had 13percent battery left i wa like eh i will charge it tomorrow night
2941,why a a man are you wearing the watch on your right hand anyway
2942,lmao that wa a funny ad
2943,they will never get u the f91w people
2944,mkbhd intro are absolute fire lately
2945,just me or doe the apple watch ultra look hella ugly
2946,ok someone tell me after i can get that keyboard 2 30
2947,it would look smaller if you loosened it and put it lower on the wrist
2948,why why why ultra it is samsungs thing literally now i always just think of samsung when i hear the name of this apple watch doe not make any sense
2949,13 06 you are awesome
2950,2 42 that is one person in the middle me with my amazfit sportwatch
2951,which laptop is he typing on 10 35
2952,that is the new dell xps 13 plus laptop
2953,u did not go to church on sunday
2954,hi marque can you please make next video in regard to best earbuds with auto switching ability in between iphone and window pc i am struggling to find one a airpods performs auto switching with apple io gadget only any suggestion please
2955,for extreme hiker that go trekking for day at a time you can have a watch that last two day great all these extreme use case feel more like excuse than legit reason to buy i would not want a non dedicated device for diving when i am 30m down i would not want a trekking watch that need me to even think about charge level for a week or ideally much longer and for most sport i would just want to don the specialist watch tool i have setup for that activity maybe for running and cycling i could see this being part of a daily routine but then a lot of the other fanciness is totally unnecessary
2956,love the lego bonsai in the backgorund 0 56
2957,69percent thats not a coincident is it
2958,i am getting triggered by the right arm watch choice
2959,the biggest problem with anodizing is that the material need a lot of time in the bath
2960,not for me i prefer garmin yes the screen is not bright and beautiful but the battery life is great
2961,wr100m is nothing for dive maybe snorkeling
2962,a a diver if it really work a a diving computer heck yeah it s worth it they usually are clunky and also expensive there isn t that much of a difference
2963,john mayer g shock well played marque i have the previous grey model and love it
2964,marque if you are wearing your watch on the right arm please rotate the display in setting so the crown is easier to access
2965,this basically the suv of the applewatches big and expensive sold
2966,1 22 are they all the embargo box for techtober
2967,i 100 percent do not need one of these and i 100 percent can not afford one but i still 100 percent want one
2968,also good vid
2969,weird mkbhd did not mention garmin
2970,black privilege fr fr
2971,oooo nice to see 20syl get a look in here thought i wa the only person who knew him lol good review too
2972,give mee
2973,come on man you basically just repeated apple spec marketing info if you want to see the watch in a regular objective test see the dc rainmaker review on youtube
2974,pro product tend to be more sleek in their design this is quite bulky and rugged so i get why it would not be called a pro
2975,what is the keyboard at 2 26
2976,intro song making me think my airpods are dying on me
2977,my god 800dollar for that crap
2978,it took until 4 13 for mr marque to come up with the idea of a black colourway and my day is made yet again
2979,loved the intro
2980,garmin laugh priceless
2981,a much a i loathe apple this is still clearly the best smartwatch money can by right now cost aside that said their ecosystem is so oppressive and anti consumer that they will never see a single cent of my money ever
2982,but it is ugly
2983,i am not a diver or an adventurer or an athlete i do not even have an apple watch but i want this one so bad
2984,one of the problem that i see here is the touch screen it is hard to rely on a touch screen instead of button for example on the garmin watch and if it is an activity that a bad movement can risk your life no way i can not see this a useful for professional climber diving etc
2985,also i seriously doubt that it is a precise a the competitor who have been focusing on precision for 10 year or so
2986,samsung and apple are doing some sort of gimmick reverse psychology the reason i think they didnt call it pro is because samsung used the pro moniker for their ultra watch remember all samsung flagship mobile device are called ultras and since they released their flagship watch first they get to pick the name first and they took pro for some reason now it wouldnt be a good thing if both samsung and apple both called their flagship watch pro right
2987,can someone confirm which pen wa that
2988,do you know how much doe it cost to register a trademark all around the world every year thats why is pro that word is not distinctive and it doesnt need to be registered a 11 12 13 therefore old brand are still in use trademark a macbook macbook air airpods iphone ipad etc are the one registered in a very special occasion a new trademark is registered what is registered the most are a few patent and several industrial design a type of patent that protects an improvement over an old product
2989,but my huawei watch can last 2 full week in full usage
2990,bunch of stuff most people do not really need
2991,this is the video i needed to make up my mind on purchasing the ultra i honestly do not do none of the diving hiking or extreme sport but i am a nurse and ever since covid 19 happened i have been doing 12 to 16 hr shift so having an apple watch that the battery last that long is so helpful due to the longer shift and such i barely got time to make sure that my device are charged so this is perfect
2992,in your intro the video show the watch in cinema mode on did you have that setting on throughout those 2 day and a half you mentioned at the start of the video the result would probably be different if that setting is not turned on all the time
2993,the elephant in the room is still the price but i guess the athlete are rich enough to not care about the cost
2994,thanks apple for motivating me to finally get a rolex i would rather spend more and get a watch that i do not need to upgrade every couple year and one that will hold it is value after 50 year
2995,69percent battery niceee
2996,gt 2 pro easily 2 week without a charge
2997,i kept on thinking the new apple watch is called the apple watch ultimate
2998,my wrist most definitely doe not seem like it is big enough for this watch lol i am not a fan of big watch i wa pretty happy with the apple watch series 3 i used to have since it did most of everything i needed it to but unfortunately it did not survive when i took a spill on my motorcycle i am hoping if i can get a new watch that it just doe most of what the series 3 did and last a long time doe not slow down since it is hard to upgrade where i am at
2999,no matter how good it is when i go for a weekend camping it take more than 36 hour so to me it is just an useless weight on my wrist it is still a toy for a walk in the local park and yes there are many watch like garmin on the market that are very functional with a decent battery life
3000,absolutely ridiculous price once again apple are twat
3001,this is one hell of an intro just wooooo
3002,what kind of car do you drive that ha that huge display
3003,no one is talking about the battery life that is the deal breaker in my case do not want to have ti charge a watch too every other day better off sticking with android smart watch 2 week battery life or garmin 3 to 4 week
3004,gt sapphire screen jerryrigeverything bet
3005,no not worth the money will be out of date in no time when there are device around just a good for half the price
3006,that intro
3007,ha anyone noticed the box in the background i am sorry i mean the block aka apple watch ultra nice touch marque
3008,those graphic never disappoint
3009,i am a hiker and a diver and admittedly a casual apple fanboy and i have not been a excited for a piece of tech in such a long time it is not a replacement for the highest end equipment out there but it doe everything i need and let me take my daily wear apple watch place i wa not able to before
3010,i would love to have that i just do not have the cash for long term hiking trip nor the time
3011,this is the apple watch that people travel internationally need that battery life is great
3012,a someone who just us it for time and siri my series 3 doe real well
3013,heyyyy yoooo who that mf editor fucking amazing job mannnnn
3014,hey mkbhd you forgot to put this video downloadable to watch later
3015,dream watch fr
3016,a wrothy upgrade from my series 4 44mm rip with my big hand fit well
3017,lego bonsai tree top 5 lego set all their floral set are just perfect
3018,it is right above the like button now marque
3019,obsessed with this watch and trying to find many reason to justify the purchase
3020,this is no fair why are these american getting the product before release why can not we go back to the old apple when everyone had fair game and had it before these american have it
3021,ultimate frisbee dude leave some girl for the rest of usss
3022,okay but what doe this do that my series 3 can not like should i upgrade or wait i got my series 3 for free thru a promo with verizon year ago now and i love this watch it is just a good a the day i bought it
3023,did you really need to explicitly compare the battery life of a smartwatch to a normal casio watch just confused about the point of that of course a smart watch is battery is nowhere close to a stopwatch water wet
3024,2 19 he mean poor lazy people 2 27 he mean rich lazy people 2 40 he mean athlete people who yet do not buy apple watch
3025,look beautiful but 800 i will keep my i will keep my gshock
3026,i love it but have not worn it yet cause it is not out in store yet for the battery life gt and the siren sound
3027,big watch are bad as and 49 mm is not that huge
3028,yeah the battery would still be an issue for a true exploration that take multiple day
3029,that intro with the watch damn
3030,the middle of nowhere got me would
3031,true i am a garmin fenix owner but this will be my first watch
3032,wrist a well a pocket should be big enough for this
3033,those intro graphic tho
3034,it still crack me up that they named it ultra instead of pro like they can not let samsung have anything lol make me wonder if there will other ultra product coming in the future
3035,sound like a deal for 800dollar
3036,main reason people do extreme sport and generally not everyday stuff need to have these bulky watch that have button and are not so expensive no need for internet connection on your watch and update etc yes the new apple watch is actually a pretty good watch but when you will get lost in the mountain you wont need only 2 day and 2 night and a third day of battery time
3037,if they were going to use a new name they should have used apple watch explorer
3038,do you normally switch hand
3039,ultra phone incoming
3040,possibly would like to think so maybe for next year
3041,been looking for a reason to upgrade from the series 4 but it is still fine for my need
3042,i wa in that boat with my 5 until he said about the battery
3043,i wa in that same boat but my heart rate do not track well anymore during workout
3044,for dollar800 i would actually consider it because it ha a lot of the update i have been missing from the apple watch however here in sweden it sell for dollar990 and that is just a bit too much for me personally
3045,i have never really considered the word pro to define the user rather the product itself so the iphone is a pro at it job
3046,black coated titanium garmin are the most scratch resistant so apple could do it
3047,bottom line this watch nah watching these video to learn editing tip yeah
3048,it seems like a rather specific product to me outside of the few people who will use these cool feature it probably will have a certain amount of appeal to men who simply like the rugged aesthetic same demo that buy a pickup truck but life in the city but i imagine many will not be into it because unlike a car you actually wear this product and if you care about looking sharp for a dinner date this may not be the vibe a for woman virtually the only woman who will buy this are professional athlete it is just too monstrous for everyday yeah feel very specific which feel unlike apple to me either this will turn out to be a bit of a miss for them or they may be getting interested in some more specific market which frankly i would love to see i just wish they would do something cool for disability an apple hearing aid would completely reshape the abysmal hearing aid market
3049,biggest issue i have had with the apple watch is how they eventually become obsolete many people enjoy simple watch because no matter how high end or cheap they all do the same thing tell time smart watch a a whole get upgraded every single year and eventually the older model get software updated out of existence their guaranteed obsolescence make it hard for people to justify the purchase of a dollar300 dollar1000 watch that will eventually need to be replaced
3050,if money is not an issue for people then what is the big deal tech is always going to become obsolete sound like a personal problem
3051,the battery life is not enough i use an ipad an iphone but my smart watch have been fitbit previously and i have the garmin fenix 6x sapphire for the past 2 and half year 2 week battery life with the ultra battery life it would not be enough for the target map esp hiker and diver where they can be off track for a few day
3052,random side note that tesla yoke steering wheel look really uncomfy
3053,review galaxy 5 pro battery
3054,so did anyone notice that marque kept moving the watch from his left wrist to his right
3055,1 27 what if apple is also working on apple watch pro model they have had ultra and pro device so what if you never know
3056,it weird that it look like cheap plastic but it is the most premium of the apple watch
3057,this guy is like the poster boy for the nwo
3058,look great but i am happy with my apple watch series4 doe everything i need for it to do
3059,i legit thought they wa gon na use the word air on their iphones in 2017 or 2019
3060,nice awes0me keep it up
3061,this is great for pro and all but what if like me you do not exercise and also do not like to know what time it is take that apple fanboys
3062,i can not for the life of me understand who think apple watch look good
3063,black version will cost 59 99 more
3064,that battery life is unbelievable i play football and basketball and the way you used your apple watch is exactly how i would a a weekend sport watch amazing
3065,apple watch ultra is only made for men in mind 49mm is big for a 6 wrist i am going to check it out to see how it would look on my petite wrist the size of the watch band will be important it is a great apple watch with wonderful feature hopefully next year apple will want female customer too i suppose an athletic woman who is over 5 5 the watch would fit petite woman are athletic too
3066,the dive band look amazing
3067,that yolk sterring is ugly
3068,still no reason for me to need or want one
3069,song is voice by 20syl
3070,this make me laugh for two reason 1 i am broke 2 my wrist are mini so this thing would be clownin on them still though a someone who go on a lot of 2 day hike the feature are cool just not necessarily groundbreaking yet
3071,the real way to get more apple watch user is to make them compatible with android just like every other smart watch is compatible with io and android not these gimmick that are trying to appeal to very specific use case for example diver are going to continue using their trusted equipment over some toy i give it 2 year and they drop this from the line up or change it drastically look what happened to the iphone mini and that wa actually popular
3072,wake up quick work out burn 2 000 calorie what is this guy training for hopefully a life of fitness
3073,for me the reason i want it is that i want the connectivity to my phone but i live in alaska and when i try to go on a run when it is cold or wet the touchscreen doe not work very well when i need to time myself to the second the touchscreen slows me down too much so the action button is a game changer
3074,the switching of arm is dependant on the use confusing
3075,doe anyone know what keyboard keycap is that at 2 44
3076,why do you wear your watch on your right hand
3077,i have been waiting for my rivian since 2019 and i am so jealous that you have one
3078,for professional use perfect for personal toy cashwaste
3079,to big too thick it is a smart watch so it is worthless after a year get a rolex or a seiko
3080,nah
3081,nahuy nado
3082,do people actually sleep with their watched on that ha got to be uncomfortable af
3083,until you updated couple of watch o later
3084,i would sill go with garmin epix gen 2 over this this to me look more like a gimmick for anyone serious about extreme outdoor activity i am sorry apple
3085,damn marque i have to say i watch your video 90percent because of the video editing and 10percent the actual product awesome
3086,see viewer how apple fan boy aka digital slave justify that 800dollar when pixel 6a came with 60hz display this guy just criticize but now ip14 and again 800dollar iwatch these manipulator are the cancer of tech world
3087,a a mid distance trail runner cyclist and climber i been waiting for something like this from apple for a while i am so excited to get mine this friday it will not replace my garmin f nix for big adventure but it will be my daily driver and trainer
3088,i already preordered it
3089,so now tech company need to look at citizen and others on how to incorporate solar power into smart watch
3090,i am a watch enthusiast and a marathon runner so the industrial design the long battery and the running screen with all the info on at once tip the balance for me will wear it for the london marathon on october 2nd and see how it go
3091,you are killing it with the intro these day brother big fan from india
3092,great graphic in this video
3093,lol you are also expecting those user to have an iphone to begin with if you went me to use your product let me use ear pod and apple watch with android i am willing to pay i just do not went to use an iphone
3094,having 3 day worth of battery i not suitable for hiker and thats without activ gps tracking activate that and this watch is down to hour
3095,i prefer a garmin watch tactix delta solar because i only have to charge it 1x a month and it make you more productive because you are not constantly looking at your phone
3096,hey marque what watch band are you wearing besides the orange one it doe not seem to be any one of the newly introduced trio
3097,finally someone is talking about the tapering of that watch band
3098,are you happy with your tesla i can not make decision between volvo xc40 pure electronic and tesla thank you so much for awesome video
3099,me watching the possible use case for this watch thinking just do not do that sh t then
3100,a someone who dive for recreation i would say the ultra is not for me i have a dive computer that cost half of the apple watch and i have not charged it for month now and give me all the information i need i also have an apple watch too for all the other activity bike hike run swim i do and give me all the information i need just saying your requirement may vary to mine i like the dive watch band though i might get it on my regular apple watch
3101,a one of those weird ultra runner people who currently us a garmin fenix these are watch that have 60 hour battery life in all system gps mode plus use on single gps satellite at more than that and an extended battery life mode like you are talking with this watch that go into the hundred of hour and expedition mode which last literally week while still periodically pinging gps i get topo map downloaded natively for free and for doing multi day run hike with gps still left on so i can go back and have fun analyzing all my data i like having way more battery than i need and being able to not think about how much battery i have when i set out a i know that even if i go out for a 10 hour saturday excursion im covered and didnt have to plan out my charging knowing there is that much battery to spare give peace of mind and a the watch and battery age it give that much more buffer before battery degradation make me want to get a new watch this all is cool but if you watch dc rainmaker review he also note that the garmin watch coros etc all have very very detailed training mode and metric calculated in each profile and not just different name applied to basically the same meterics for different sport
3102,i will stick with my omega seamaster diver 300m chronograph gmt my watch went to the moon bitch well the speedmaster but basically the same thing
3103,i work in an industrial environment and my apple watch have been beaten to hell so i upgraded to the ultra to see if it hold up better
3104,69percent battery nice
3105,bit of a funny random background but i love the lego tree
3106,stupid question in europe it cost 1000euros
3107,when they give it continuous glucose monitoring cgm i will buy it it will be a must have for me and a lot of other people blood pressure monitoring would be an added plus for now i see no need for me to buy any apple watch or other smart watch i ordered the samsung watch 5 pro but i will return it since i found review that say the blood pressure monitor is not accurate
3108,get a black hoodie watch strap that hide the slab in a black case
3109,correct me if im wrong but i think marque is wearing the watch on the wrong hand
3110,i am by no mean an adventurer or who this watch is marketed towards but i do work outdoors in a semi construction environment so i ordered one for the extra durability every apple watch i have had up to this point ha gotten trashed cosmetically hopefully this one will be different
3111,samsung s22 ultra apple copy samsung
3112,did not even mention anything about surfing or skiing snowboarding which could also be great us for this watch
3113,your intro mahn hollywood could legit take some tip
3114,now i can go on a weekend trip and not bring a charger i am in
3115,i hike but what grab my attention with this watch is not just for hiking it is the battery life compared to my series 7 and the scratch on the glass and the fragility of the series 7 to have a more solid watch with hopefully a le scratchable screen is very interesting after 6 month my series 7 is quite scratched without using it while climbing or in dangerous for the watch activity it is quite fragile to be honest
3116,apple watch ultra is only for bear grylls
3117,battery life need to last at least 5 day apple should have implemented solar cell to help extend the battery life i am not going to pull the trigger because i still prefer battery life over everything
3118,in a green theme this is a omnitrix for me
3119,is the screen actually larger than s7 45mm i am curious if it is that is interesting
3120,i am distracted by how much calorie you are burning per day
3121,we know it we always knew apple ha always have really good line of product great even but they put them in a really steep price which kinda vexed and annoy me and yet a lot of them from my space or cirlces us apple is product i totally get it why is their product so expensive i actually like apple i used to have 2nd gen ipad and iphone 4 those are great at that time it got great memory apple always ha it cheap copy sometimes it even better currently i do not use apple thing and i sometimes hate apple the fact that they do not have budget or bang for the buck product me personally i would choose apple product all day if i am financially supported they are really expensive i do not get it why i liked and hated them fair do is apple fair do is
3122,do not mind me this is just a rant of me being jealous high key it kinda sound that i am not a grateful kid trust me i am hugely grateful in the current situation that i am in rn i am sorry i had to let it out somewhat and it is in the yt comment great therapy yumna just great
3123,marque learns how to scuba dive to test the apple watch sound like a fire studio channel video
3124,fact because it is apple people from around the world who is fanboys fangirls will always give a pas for whatever they will sell period if it is a different brand with all that hardware amp software people will say it look tacky what in the world they were thinking it is gigantic etc that is what the world we are living in now by the way i tested amp tried it in apple store for 30 minute and it is comically huge with me wearing the latest galaxy watch 5 pro silver edition and even people there love the style amp look of the new watch 5 pro than their giant watch 8 ultra so the old saying of whatever apple will sell there is idiot will say it is beautiful magical etc even it is not at all is true it is like a shrank ipod that wa slapped over your wrist the apple watch 8 ultra have a great day to y all
3125,for dollar700 battery need to last at least a week for me i hate charging my series 6 everyday so i do not even wear it anymore by now apple should have solar solution for watch still wearing my g shock mtg solar it is 10 yr old i may give it a try and see how it stand up to hunting surf fishing and offshore fishing will come in handy on camping trip hopefully i am not disappointed sorry i mean dollar800
3126,10 26 how the did you write that so fast me be like chilkinf
3127,sound track is from vox
3128,the video wa great and all but can we take time to appreciate the video quality and story telling keep it up man killin it
3129,considering most of the time apple watch last a day max with use this is pretty great that said i know that i am never going to pay more for a smart watch than what i paid for the se because i am not a person who ha high impact usage need out of a smart watch
3130,amazing intro like always
3131,20percent off man
3132,that battery low sound effect 1 11 gave me anxiety for a second thought it wa my airpods
3133,awesome video sorry i am so late
3134,from a diving perspective once it can measure all the aspect needed for diving and replace my dive computer i am much more interested it should not be too hard to do considering my current high pressure monitor is wireless
3135,10 15 wa too funny
3136,this watch should have definitely be named pro a it is built for professional
3137,good point likely to see a real pro watch some time in the future that is not the ultra
3138,i do not know how anybody can sleep with a tank on their arm
3139,i wonder what the aftermarket have in plan to make it more discreet
3140,honestly mainly interested in this for the battery life especially with the sleep tracking being updated so much right before this release i feel like something that last this long is the only way to get accurate info on that and the ruggedness a well i use my current apple watch to track and it is definitely got some battle scar
3141,tubasweb they do not to me i do not let them lock me i do not use icloud i have like 500tb of server drive for storing my own file no typo 500 tb
3142,drixxer you do not have to pay all that at once though
3143,ct gaming they are but they tend to pull you in next thing you know you are locked in via apple pay icloud itunes etc you can not leave 30 year from now and you are still paying apple monthly to store your photo and music that you own
3144,tubasweb some of the apple product are really good but the smart watch line are just dumb my garmin is solar powered too smh some people do not do research at all
3145,the battery life is a joke huawei is best watch ha a 15 day battery life
3146,that sound at the beginning had me thinking my airpods battery wa dead
3147,no way expensive toy fitbit is better with battery life
3148,i am not an athlete by any mean but i have been looking to upgrade my now over 2 year old series 5 and the more i think about the ultra the more it make sense even for me double the battery life mean theoretically double the battery lifespan plus the crown guard is also super appealing i often have a case on mine not so much for protection but more so to stop me from accidentally pressing it and activating siri whenever i bend my wrist back like when pushing up off something to stand i have pretty dainty wrist though so i definitely need to try and find one in store somewhere to try on
3149,2000 kcal burn wtf
3150,apple is truly an innovative company that is why all others try to emulate apple
3151,the name just seems like this watch wa not deemed worthy for the pro moniker maybe there is another product under development
3152,great review a always i am a marathoner and have been using garmin forerunner 945 whose battery last seven day using gps several time a week for different run workout in addition it allows me to track my cross training apple giving me couple of day just will not cut it so will wait around for next update
3153,it doe not come in black that is a no by default for me then lol i do not really like the general aesthetic really either it look like it belongs on a building site or something it is a very rugged look also the orange strap on yours doe not help with that look like a black amp decker product or something a lot of builder gear is orange like that add to that the crown guard the squareness of the whole thing it look like one of those lifeproof phone case or something really do not dig it and yeah the lack of black colour for me settle it i will never buy or own that watch i would much prefer a series 8 for now tho i am happy with my series 6
3154,would have been cool er if they applied a g shock type casing so it would even be more compatible for hard use
3155,you should go diving with it because i fear the reaper with this one a lot of trusted brand such a garmin suunto aqualung sheerwater have dive computer that are circular and air intergrated you should try them all out on a dive buddy or something
3156,for me it everyone trying to justify only one small minor feature for them to buy it xd yall just buy it if you want it no need to try to justify it
3157,a a stay at home dad who know people who buy apple product this review wa very helpful thank you
3158,apple make a new watch me take my money
3159,i did not know mkbhd could draw
3160,this guy can film in a room full of a box and make it look professional
3161,this watch is the size of the first iphone and very ugly i am glad samsung make better looking watch than apple
3162,the casio battery to apple watch comparison wa totally nonsense
3163,is that a bonsai tree back there also what are those box about in the background great video thou
3164,did he seriously just compare a smartwatch is battery life to a regular watch is battery life
3165,it look really nice beautiful watch
3166,i am a bug chaser and sometimes with other watch a hornet can hear me coming when my text ding go off so with this great watch i can silent the message and catch that unsuspecting hornet
3167,first one min is how good is battery can you do after 2 year and see battery life
3168,i just realized that it doe not even matter if the watch is for pro user
3169,why did not you review the samsung galaxy watch 5 pro
3170,gnarly scar on your hand look like a surgery
3171,i will wait til apple ha solar charging wonder how many year they will milk people until they include it when other watch improve enough where they do not need an apple watch
3172,0 15 is that how people using the steering wheel in tesla now
3173,it is huge lmao
3174,so it doesnt jerk me off no thanks
3175,what playing frisbee for 3 hour burn 2000 calorie what
3176,samsung s22 plus with 5 pro watch is fantastic no overpriced unlike apple
3177,they just need to go ahead and come out with apple solar i am sure they could make it look pretty cool maybe have paneling around the frame and it could pick up sun and ambient light to charge who know but it would be nice nasty catch by the way i had no idea it wa like that i have been looking for something new outside of basketball and biking that might be my next fix
3178,ultimate frisbee is fun
3179,shiey will have good use for this watch
3180,i have only had rog phone since they came out cause i knew the power user feature were exactly what i wanted so that example wa perfect
3181,that is one ugly looking watch
3182,that price is pretty absurd it is a huge upgrade but pas dollar200 more get you a top tier smart phone
3183,i do not think many marathoner triathletes will pick up this watch i am a runner an know that i can get a much smaller garmin at half the price with twice the feature metric i can not imagine this watch sell well
3184,buy a real watch they actually last you 50 year like a good swiss watch whatever brand you choose will last personally i love the great japanese brand seiko this watch reminds me of how stupid apple watch and all smart watch are in a year it worthless just like the first apple watch in 20k gold wa at this time of day nobody remembers it same will happen to this crap and i am sure a casio g shock can do everything the apple watch can without all the useless bit like sleep tracker stop drinking caffeine and eat healthier you will be way more energetic in the day and sleep better bam
3185,compare it with a casio gshock
3186,maybe they should call it the apple watch ultra vanity
3187,are you wearing the old nike strap
3188,bro you got a metacarpal fracture just like me in the right hand sick hopefully it wa not due to something young and stupid like me
3189,not very good battery life for a watch
3190,marque still wear his wrist on his right wrist
3191,can i still use the watch without having an iphone
3192,look worth it to me great tech
3193,it is more than being a pro apple watch that is why it is called ultra
3194,samsung with ultra phone and pro watch apple with pro phone and ultra watch
3195,i want this watch so bad one and only one thing stop me from dropping the money right now in 2022 why can not we run zello on this device now i know apple ha it own stupid walkie talkie app but it is useless because just because i would have a watch doe not mean that 95percent of my friend do do not they know that allowing this one app to function would sell so many watch to people like me who otherwise love this watch
3196,did you get surgery on that right hand marque
3197,2000calories burned what what workout did you do
3198,i would so buy a series 8 49mm all i want is the bigger battery
3199,my apple watch series 3 just broke i bought the apple watch ultra do i scuba dive no do i do trialthalons no do i want a longer battery life bigger display and a cooler looking watch yes mine should arrive in two day excited
3200,the unboxing of the watch is one of the most impressive unboxing i have seen in quite sometime it is an experience
3201,dollar800 fuck that what
3202,ha so it ha the feature that my galaxy watch from 2020 ha besides the battery life i get 4 to 5 day
3203,tf would like to know the story behind that huge scar on your hand are u a wolverine too
3204,a a person who is 6 4 i have a large wrist wearing a apple watch made my wrist look huge lol i did not like that and never considered buying one because of that now that there is a larger watch you bet i am getting one finally lol
3205,why do you sometimes wear it on the left and sometimes on the right arm
3206,these intro get better and better respect best tech youtuber out there
3207,i just want it in black
3208,samsung watch 5 pro
3209,reading the justification for this is making me laugh i have recently realized that my 13 pro phone is over kill the watch series 7 is over kill and my macbook pro is over kill no one ever seems to feel this way it is always the bigger and better for most upgrade that you do not even use
3210,i feel that some of the endurance athlete and people who this is intented for probably will not want a smart watch when i put on my garmin and head out for a run i want to be in the moment without seeing notification and other feature that are on my smart phone intentionally i turn off notification and rarely connect my watch via bluetooth to my phone only doing so once in a while to sync up activity or sw update maybe i will change my mind and i do see the appeal if i wa a scuba diver great video btw
3211,battery life durability increased water resistance a some apple watch have failed on contact with moisture seen a few at the apple store upgraded mics and speaker a taking call on watch only can be a challenge the ultra is absolutely welcomed i am still just going to change my ss6 battery and ride until a health sensor get released that i will benefit from looking forward to hydration tracking blood pressure or blood glucose monitoring apple should read the depth gauge in diagnostics to determine if someone went beyond 100m for warranty coverage not covering water damage is perplexing and eu customer protection law with 2 and three year warranty put ours to shame those other watch do not run a full operating system so battery life on the apple watch will always be worse i can not graft on smart watch feature but i can charge so apple watch all the way
3212,i will wait for the black ultra watch for now my series 7 is still yummy
3213,it is for the same people that bought the 24k apple watch
3214,5 37 i think there wil be a new product fit my wrist on which you place the watch on
3215,it is not worth it for roughly 95percent of the country but people never change so they will buy it it is no question why the economy is heading to the place it is heading and why so many people only have a few thousand in the bank
3216,how much did apple pay you for this video
3217,the drawing
3218,dollar50 more for better protection and better life over the stainless steel series 8 seems like a deal to me
3219,can you review the series 8
3220,they could use dlc coating
3221,the production level on this video is that is why i freaking love watching your video a lot
3222,or just wanted a watch in adult sized
3223,imo not worth it i would rather get a nice g shock or two with the same money
3224,i love my casio a168 battery last 10 year
3225,do not forget se 2
3226,lol 0 16 i said nice at the same time
3227,below the like button i see what you did there
3228,pro at donating to apple
3229,neck to rolex
3230,mkbhd play football
3231,i mean the ultra will still be no good for scuba diver 100m wr is nowhere near what a proper dive watch computer will reach
3232,marque you are just too good at this
3233,800dollar of mediocre can do everything but not good at any one thing
3234,the quality and intro of the video is on fire period
3235,here in brasil the price it is 10x expensive than the minimum salary lkkkkkk
3236,casually mention he went to the met gala
3237,lot of upgrade but i will wait for an apple watch that can last for at least 4 5 day with heavy usage and 2 week with light usage like the huawei watch
3238,a too bad you could not borrow a fenix for size comparison in this video
3239,being a samsung user no lie i wa like damn i mean they beat sammy to the ultra name lol and finally got a 3 day battery great apps and construction but for dollar800 damn love the dollar100 band be ready to spend a g not me but maybe if samsung actually come out with a better watch still rocking the galaxy gear s3 it is battery construction and usability still work for me
3240,marque have you thought about using your influence to grow ultimate i would love to see that happen
3241,personally i plan on getting it i am pretty heavy into endurance fitness though i am pretty curious how it will hold up while rock climbing however with that said im sure the series 8 would do just fine mostly i am buying it for the battery life
3242,hold i didnt even realize they already had it out unless you are an early receiver alot of ppl were complaining about the screen size but i also prefer the bigger screen it pretty much the same size a a normal watch
3243,i have it now mostly got it for the battery life too but honestly the bigger screen is so much better than my series 5
3244,i feel the bezel on the ultra is huge coming from the series 7 with really thin bezel and with the curved edge it look even thinner the considerable empty space around the screen look obstructive
3245,there is another group this watch will work well for that is not often thought about that being the vision impaired community a larger screen better clarity because of brightness bigger more tactical button and throw in the better gps that can help within city this all mean a far better experience for using the device and navigating around
3246,it probably cause they will come out with a pro still priced under the ultra
3247,my applewatch 6 is at the bottom of the indian ocean in maldives right now because the strap unbuttoned when i wa swimming
3248,i bet people will still try and put a case on this
3249,this thing is 1120usd in india
3250,nailed the intro again
3251,it is so weird apple named their watch ultra but samsung called their watch pro it is mixed up
3252,dude you do not count total calorie only active calorie count
3253,most modern smartwatches the battery last day casio solar it doe not even come with a charger
3254,before i purchased my series 7 graphite i tried a garmin for me apple hit a sweet spot i wa already ready to pay this premium and i wanted something more rugged and had a longer battery i am hoping it arrives before this camping trip this weekend keeping my series 7 for other occasion apple knew exactly what to give u and leave u wanting more it is another apple watch
3255,which keyboard is that at 2 25
3256,i just want c time
3257,i will wait till the revision
3258,everything is electric even car also
3259,doe the ultra need a face protector
3260,btw you did not burn 1800 cals super inaccurate
3261,i just had to plug in my fenix 7x after 25 day off the charger lmao 3 day ai not nothing let is be real most serious athlete are still going garmin at this point
3262,only l love stevejobs i love apple but u really good awesome men i like it pro tha world no one apple
3263,made me want to get the watch again had the original apple watch then the series 5 and ended up just never wanting to charge it it would almost always be dead when on my wrist and after updating the firmware the following year it just stopped working all together and while i arranged for apple support to fix it i never sent it to them for repair cause i just never really used it mainly again for low battery performance but your analysis make me interested again a always m b love your thoroughness
3264,not really on topic about the watch but i could not help notice the scar on your right hand what is it from it look precise like you had a procedure to fix something also i noticed you goto randalls island i used to race pocket bike there for fun many year ago
3265,john mayer g shock
3266,please review the iphone 14 camera shaking
3267,you got a gnarly scar in your hand
3268,solar charging pro
3269,graphic are on point not on the apple watch ultra on your video killing it mkbhd
3270,close but still not there for backpacking sure the garmins etc are not a smart but you can go a week in the backcountry without carrying an external power bank and battery tech just is not there yet to match that with this kind of watch maybe once solid state battery hit the market
3271,it just need 4 full day of battery while using half the time with gps tracker enabled backpacking trip and hunting trip could then fit in this group but garmin is 20 day battery and 5 day with gps enabled is unmatched
3272,4 10 the previous high end apple watch 7 wa also titanium and came in both the natural titanium color and space black titanium not painted 6 35 actually with shortcut you can make that button do practically anything
3273,nah
3274,this is an entry level sport watch
3275,let is be honest everyone who buy this is going to run 1 mile at the gym on a treadmill
3276,huawei watch can last up to 2 week
3277,a a hiker 2 day battery life is not good at all garmin is a top tier watch for hiking because it can last longer than a month
3278,i do not need an apple watch but i have one i do not need an apple watch ultra but i want one
3279,i do use my apple watch to keep track of my heart rate among other thing i do wan na get a series 7 or 8 for the blood oxygen sensor and other stuff
3280,this still look like a clunky child is smartwatch i would feel like i am wearing my nephew ticktalk 4 maybe is a combination of the size and color but it is not it for me
3281,0percent not worth spending 800 on that shit
3282,0 22 show that marque is using his other phone a gps because tesla is is not accurate enough perhaps
3283,woke up with charge up to 200 percent
3284,i will not be surprised if one day we wake up to to the fact that apple and samsung actually belong to brother because they copy each other low key pro gone for ultra
3285,i just want a super cut of all of these sick intro graphic
3286,00 12 what is that scar on your right hand from jeez
3287,all these people just recommending a normal watch do you want or have a car nah just walk haha
3288,missed everyday people i have no intention on hiding the most impressive apple watch to date you need to see this finally a apple watch for the larger wrist man working day to day a well a being active no time for the met gala lol
3289,nah
3290,wearing a watch while sleeping is a stupid thing i have done next day morning there wa a watch cutout on my face a i slept on the watch then i ditched that and sleep without it
3291,learn to wear a watch properly on the left hand a any normal person ffs
3292,your video never disappoint
3293,i literally just want the screen size and battery life
3294,i wa wondering since you have apple watch ultra can i have your old series 7 apple watch so i can use for my marathon and cycling training thank you in advance idol mkbhd god bless
3295,marque ultimate is cool but come ride road bike with u up 9w sometime actually one reason i will never pickup an apple watch is no ant connection for powermeter and other sensor data i have a coros pace 2 for working out and then use good ole analog watch for going out
3296,lol missing the strategy from apple they know they will not get the hard core fringe group in fact that group is laughing at apple is attempt apple is selling fantasy to the herd that want to be like that fringe hard core group so it is the wan na be strategy
3297,dam bruh you do have some skinny wrist lol
3298,afaik you can not anodize titanium black best you can get is a kinda trippy dark purple or dark brown
3299,i really wonder if you could make like a dynamo driven automatic smart watch like an automatic watch but with a dynamo recharging the battery of the smart watch giving you some extra battery life maybe even infinite battery life packaging would be a nightmare though
3300,i have always bought the apple watch nike version this one had my name written all over it
3301,it is too bulky for me but i am really impressed with this watch
3302,how many time are we going to hear about you wearing your apple watch to the met gala we get it you went to the met gala i agree with your review it is so interesting of a watch because it ha all these wonderful benefit especially that battery life and all these great feature but it is overkill and i could not see there being another watch the apple would make that would be in between the two watch that would give workout feature and better battery life and remove all the other stuff unfortunately i am sad that the pixel watch will not even match up to the new apple watch it is so much better looking i hate the square look of an apple watch
3303,hi out of interest how do you like the orange alpine loop band i might get it for my series 7 and i want to know if it is good i am a rock climber and want a tougher band
3304,can we talk about the spot on exposure with the filming outside
3305,just like linus always like to use extra high wattage psu so the fan doe not turn on
3306,all i want from the ultra is the red shift hopefully i can get that on my little 41mm in a software update
3307,apple watch max
3308,if you can afford to spend dollar800 on the new apple watch then your priority is not whether it is worth it or not your priority is being able to say you spent dollar800 dollar on the new apple watch
3309,it is the size of a dead turtle no wonder the battery last forever
3310,no my dollar229 apple watch se wa worth it that clunky chunker is trash
3311,im getting it for the battery and screen brightness the fact that i get a siren hehehe is just a plus
3312,too many ad on youtube hate this platform now can not even get through an entire mkbhd video anymore
3313,well mkbhd ha sold me on this watch in le than 50 second
3314,well who is going to spend 800dollar for a watch that in exactly 12 month time there will be a better version announced even if you need it for the extra feature is it a well worthy investment
3315,i am one of those ppl who will prob never have a need for an apple watch always feel like a hammer looking for a nail
3316,it is just another way for them to track your every move
3317,just need color
3318,the question is how are you going to charge your watch with the waypoints after a 7 day travel to the mountain s
3319,samsung get the battery this good cmon
3320,square face provides more real estate in same or smaller diameter of larger diameter watch face that is round
3321,13 07
3322,why ha nobody mentioned the potential for all day battery life for watch only use i want to use my iphone le so being able to go out for the whole day with only my watch and still be able to make and receive call and text is such a bonus
3323,tim cook doe not understand marketing or he would have named this apple watch pro
3324,i do not think fitness folk actually care that much about the watch ultra not being able to look slick in a tux because most fitness folk want people to know that they are fitness folk and so the bulky bright watch ultra scream it for them for them like vegan or cross fit folk
3325,how did you get it early
3326,the comparison of the watch to the gaming phone give it an outlook that is quite endearing
3327,you showed theater mode being enabled that entire time you talked about the battery life in the intro i am curious what the battery life would be like without compromising on it feature
3328,people keep saying it not a heavy a it look so what doe it mean is it 1 5 time the regular watch is it lighter
3329,do you think it is good for covering my cycling event a well a my garmin epic 2
3330,i love the lego bonsai on the back
3331,im pretty sure the main core feature of the ultra is something that eeeeverrrrybody us longer battery life gt lt
3332,that intro wa insane
3333,rock climber still very much worry that the screen will get cracked i never wear my watch while climbing because the screen get so scratched
3334,that is a huge watch
3335,100 meter or 100 foot water resistance
3336,too bad my made in china dollar10 still show me the same 60mins 1 hour so i will not spend my dollar800 on it
3337,hold one a second air integration are you sure marque have not heard that also what is tank pressure monitoring
3338,69percent battery nice
3339,my uncle made the dive computer for the apple watch
3340,where did you get those scar on wrist if you do not mind me asking
3341,i have been into big watch before my apple watch and actually wa missing the large size most attractive for me is the extra battery life i constantly get pinged with work message and battery doe not last 16 hour sometimes so i am looking forward to this
3342,itzmalick go away nobody asked about your channel
3343,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
3344,subtle john mayer watch flex
3345,dbrand coming up with a clutch
3346,i really be forgetting he ha a normal life
3347,my huwawai watch battery life is 15 day and i brought it 4 year ago just for 140 usd and it is working fine without any issue
3348,that low gawd dayum sent me
3349,i would still rather have a dick tracy 2 way radio watch
3350,marque the watch should be on your left wrist
3351,a a dude with no job and a recluse all the extreme extra feature is really not important to me im just getting it for the better battery the brighter screen and the overall bigger watch
3352,watching this with earphone i am glad he did not let u hear that siren at 10 00 i prepared myself and got nervous just to be saved
3353,you burn 2k in 3 hour i burn 2k in 50 min shit i did not know that wa good
3354,bro the research he doe before making a video ayo respect marque
3355,a a garmin fenix 6x pro solar amp apple watch 6 owner i think this standard of the battery must last a month is a bit irrational and overblown for 95percent of people who make that argument and not a feature that most fitness watch user actually use or need case in point how many people complain that their cellphone doe not last a month no one why well that is unrealistic and also because charging your phone is not a big deal why is charging your watch suddenly a big deal not many real world reason it is just a feature that we are used not and not one we actually use first i bet most fitness watch user do not go week without charging their watch secondly it is not much of an inconvenience to charge apple watch once a day or once every couple of day unless you really want to track sleep and even then when you wake up you can put it on the fast charger while you get ready for the next hour then throw it on for the rest of the day thirdly one of the reason why multi week battery life is likely a big deal is because charging most other fitness watch is clumsy and not convenient my garmin fenix 6x pro solar ha a wonky proprietary charger and it is not very convenient to charge so i rarely make the effort to charge it my apple watch on the other hand is super easy to charge with it is magnetic wireless charger so i think this whole battery must last a month is just a talking point rather than a feature that most fitness watch user actually use and when they do it is likely because charging is not easy and intuitive this requirement is like pixel peeping with pro camera doe it actually make a real world difference no it is simple to charge your watch every 1 3 day
3356,one question mate btw awesome dive to catch the frisbee did the apple watch recognize a fall when you jumped there
3357,hellahgooooddddd
3358,the suv of apple watch
3359,a pro is someone who get paid for what they do a a professional get paid for what they do
3360,let is play some ultimate bro
3361,8 2
3362,if u could stream music with it i would buy it
3363,speaking from an electrical engineering nerd perspective i just geek had to have it for the large display i am a big guy too so the large size will not bother me also being in my mid 40 is helping out my eyesight a well also big upgrade for me a i am still rocking a series 2 apple watch can not wait for my delivery
3364,i think there wa a patent or trademark on the word watch pro so they went with ultra instead
3365,i am a diver and i am very intrigued a to how the apple watch would do if they added air integration i would have been all over it
3366,8 50
3367,more apple infomercial please stop apple should hire this guy
3368,apple switched from naming everything with an i to pro
3369,dear apple you have the entire forearm technically to work with make rectangle and flat
3370,what phone are you currently using
3371,lego bonsai mkbhd edition coming soon
3372,i will buy it once apple add blood pressure and glucose sensor
3373,it is crazy how marque get more view then apple
3374,i have had the apple watch suunto 9 baro and currently have the garmin 6x doing the usual mountain stuff in colorado west and the traditional apple watch battery life just did not cut it for my purpose this one is interesting but my garmin 6x get about 9 hard day of daily wear mountain activity can not beat it if i just wore it without working out every day which probably will never happen you could get 10 full day out of a single charge of course the garmin doe not have the same or close feature but for a mountain athlete it crush
3375,can we just appreciate that frisbee catch for a second wow haha 13 07
3376,lot of people like this me personally it so ugly id hate myself wasting money on it the standard ha become long in the tooth and look old
3377,comparing casio is battery life to this watch is battery life given the two watch usage and capability seems a bit unfair and not really relevant when will that casio watch be able do anything in the same way of the ultra other than that really excited about the watch and great review
3378,i run a lot do marathon and really like the other feature that garmins do not offer
3379,you definitely had 2 watch on
3380,what setting did you change on this watch if any so that others can set there is like yours to get good battery life out of their watch i wish i would not have bought the i7 3 month ago and instead waited for this one
3381,pipboy 3000
3382,next apple will be introducing the macbook ultra the iphone ultra airpods ultra and the apple watch pro which will be the same a the ultra but in aluminum and or stainless come on now get with the program
3383,they call it the pro because samsung coined the pro for one of their watch so apple being the humourous ppls that they are stole the moniker that samsung us to identify their highest tier phone the ultra
3384,i love this but when a watch is the price of an iphone 13 it a bit much
3385,no thanks
3386,the best news about this watch is the second generation will be a lot better
3387,thanks for the review i want to get this but the price is stopping me 800 buck that is insane
3388,thanks for drawing
3389,might look like it it aim at a very niche group but actually a more of u get more into sport and gym it is actually answering a growing need
3390,im gettin it do not need it but im getting it maybe after the 14 pro though
3391,nice
3392,nice watch bro
3393,the apple watch ultra is chunky ugly and expensive which nobody need or asked for but apple is stupid enough to make it
3394,nice
3395,if it not in black i can not do it
3396,my honor band give me more than two week of battery life and this piece of expensive cake last just 2 day pro
3397,suunto user here who absolutely want one of these honestly still bummed it is not round because a watch should be round but hey at least it is not going to crack when i smack it against the deck on the bow of the race boat during a gybe
3398,and yeah that battery life is only just going to make the length of the offshore race i do
3399,2 day and 2 night are still rookie number
3400,who else seen the word ultra in scrabble letter 2 38
3401,i would get this watch straight away if i have the money
3402,i will be still keeping my apple my series 6 but i think the apple watch ultra is a dope watch
3403,too big for me will stick with the 6
3404,sheesh 1783 active calorie that is my active calorie for two day hahaha
3405,should not look at the apple watch ultra a an upgrade rather an addition to your other watch
3406,apple watch ultra is actually water resistant to up to 50 meter it is most definately not waterproof up 100 meter
3407,dollar800 and no internet browser apple ha joke and it is selling a phone sized watch with limited capability that are sub par to the price point i will stick with my series 7 apple watch since paying an extra dollar300 for added battery time is not practical at all
3408,this is the second time you mentioned that you went to the met gala
3409,apple watch is cool to be honest alot of my friend who ha one love it i even manage to borrow 1 to try it out an i like it but for my wrist it can only be a rolex
3410,better than calling it the apple watch plus
3411,i think the watch is going to be amazing and can not wait for mine to be delivered however i also think there are group of people that this watch applies to that apple kind of forgot about construction worker police officer firefighter wild land firefighter emt is and paramedic tow truck driver and many more all of these individual would benefit from a more rugged and tough apple watch with longer battery life compass and waypoint functionality an emergency siren etc i think there is a large group of everyday people who this watch can cater to not just uber athlete adventurer obviously the price may be a deterrent for some but i think there are many people other than athlete that this watch will appeal to
3412,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
3413,full feature but not even 48 hour lasting any reason put on this watch for extreme activity half way hanging in the cliff pull out your charging cable
3414,this is why i use the garmin fenix plus model and use a real dive watch that i do not have to worry about my garmin just keep running and running on one continuous charge also correct me if i am wrong but someone told me that they heard that the diving app is going to cost money to use it
3415,a gentleman doe not wear a watch with dinner suit
3416,so do you still need to be 100percent invested in the apple ecosystem to use this watch
3417,if i could get a week out of the watch i would pick it up without having to kill feature or go into battery saving mode garmin tactix 7 pro ha spoiled me
3418,lem me guess if you have an apple watch do not buy if you do not have one get this one
3419,i rather wear audemars piguet
3420,all the goody in the world and my dude always default to tesla and apple
3421,it is time to see iphone ultra with increased thickness that allows the back of the phone sit flush with the camera lens that will easily give phone the desired battery life usb c with rugged easily replaceable frame eliminating the need for a case
3422,middle of nowhere love it got ta say that the sketch wa perfect and clearly show who this apple watch ultra is built for off to listen to the podcast since i wanted to know exactly what you brought them in for what do the expert in their respective field think and even if the scuba support ha zero relevance to most of u that doe not mean it is not a valid design element
3423,middle of nowhere for 4 or more day with 36 hour battery useless
3424,i wish regular apple watch had flat screen too
3425,so nobody is gon na talk about that insane catch that he made
3426,a an avid follower of tech i would buy this purely based on the marketing convincing me i need it and falling into the trap of consumerism
3427,everything about it seems cool except the thickness i wa late to the watch game just because of how bulky smart watch are this is not doing it for me if they dropped maybe a le feature rich thinner version with this screen size that would be great till then it a pas
3428,why would those poeple py that much more for a watch they didnt see a need for to begin with
3429,iphone ultra coming soon
3430,i do not have an apple watch coz it is an additional thing for me to charge maybe once they have longer battery life
3431,being someone in the military we routinely go on ruck and workout where my apple watch is constantly dying getting triggered by sweat etc this sound like a great improvement for an apple watch i am still not impressed by the battery but i will see how the next generation look in order to warrant purchasing the watch
3432,tomorrow the apple ultra 2 is out the 7 is look more like upside down j is anyone who doe not have the new ultra2 is a loser get it now only dollar1 299 00
3433,awesome video a always lt 3 wish i could get this watch just because it is bad arse haha
3434,samsung should name it rugged smartwatch galaxy watch pro
3435,a someone who dive recreational it probably will not replace my dive computer yet i am excited to see the next generation on what it can possibly do though the current pro i see automatically log your dive if you do electronic dive log share your dive with everyone else perhaps give you more tangible feedback if you are ascending or descending too quickly like bigger vibration sometimes hearing the beep in the ocean is quite hard what i hope it can do in the future gps tracking of all of your dive buddy and group if they wear the ultra or some water proof airtag there were moment where i dove with only 1m of visibility so it can be hard to track anyone down there if they had a radar display or an arrow that point where your dive buddy is and how far that will be neat
3436,realistically this isnt possible with their current implementation of gps or their precice location chip in the air tag they are simply just too high frequency to do anything useful in any appreciable amount of water you would need some ultra low frequency wave past the point of data and more a a spatial ping which just end up being sonar
3437,corey johnson that is right with oceanic i totally forgot about that pay extra for something that is already included in other product
3438,i have no plan to pay a subscription fee for a dive computer is my biggest gripe
3439,the issue with this watch when it come to diving a i see it is then lack of versatility when it come to deco it can not compute different gas and switching in between gas either but then it is not really meant for technical diving either
3440,d w it wont be replacing my dive computer shearwater peregrine just yet either but im also excited to see where this will end up although i doubt well see underwater navigation buddy tracking anytime soon maybe a few iteration down the road but not in the near future imo because it would require a seperate radio that us low frequency and even then it would only be good to 10 15 foot so unless youre in 5ft or le of viz then it wouldnt really make sense for apple to add a feature like this i think it would be a great feature on some other dive specific equipment though like if shearwater added it to the perdix or something
3441,2 full day with always on display on or off did not mention bro
3442,for me they need to improve battery life had a series 6 and having to charge pretty much everyday to make sure sleep is tracked is annoying since got a fitbit sense and have all the same feature which actually last me a full week of charge once they get there im in
3443,i feel like the apple watch ultra wa created for the extreme athlete which is not a bad thing though
3444,nah can build a gaming pc for that much
3445,they could make a 4th model and call it the pro
3446,marque gave me the green light it is time to buy
3447,ahhh his scar get me
3448,dollar800 sheesh
3449,this wa a great review
3450,just mark casually flexing his muscle and vein to u nothing special
3451,interesting he ha the melgeek mojo68 plastic wa not expecting that but also not surprised off white aesthetic great keyboard that is why i have one too
3452,why doe not anyone mention this watch will also suit people who are more hand on at work i got it due to the titanium case and the flat screen with edge protection i will feel much more confident raw dogging it at work now i use a bumper case on my series 6
3453,1 on this i have had apple watch since the very first one and do not use any of the health or fitness feature at all so while i will happily take the extra battery life i do not really need it since i already finish the day with gt 50percent battery life however the ultra appeal to me because the display technically cover glass of my apple watch get so beat up and putting a screen protector on the curved glass look feel weird to me so i do not
3454,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
3455,69percent nice
3456,too bulky
3457,what to sell a bigger battery smartwatch they created all that marketing theatrics about ultra user
3458,then in a year they will push an update to nuke your battery so you have to buy a new one xd
3459,if only samsung watch could last this long
3460,69percent battery nice
3461,i appreciate the lego banzai tree in the background
3462,smart watch battery life or the lack of it have always been a deal breaker for me good to see apple is trying to make it better but a couple of day battery life is still somewhat hot hum though i do not know if there is a setting for watch only mode but that might make it a bit more palatable in my case i do not need all smart function all the time
3463,football hd i have this watch i do not and never ever got anywhere near 7 10 day without turning basically all the feature off
3464,garmin venu 2 easily 7 10 day battery life
3465,my ticwatch pro 3 ultra when apple watch got 3 day battery life rookie number
3466,my question is have i been wearing my iwatch wrong my button are towards my finger
3467,when it is that sweet number nice is the word period
3468,the intro look like a commercial for the apple watch i wa kinda expecting a white screen and the apple logo afterwards haha
3469,no apple watch is worth 800dollar my goodness guy be smart with your money and get a garmin inreach mini satellite communicator now that is worth your money and can save your life
3470,wow
3471,look like mkbhs going out of graphic budget pen and paper to the rescue
3472,they could have done a dlc coating on the titanium
3473,apple probably want to get samsung angry so they can not call their galaxy watch ultra anymore
3474,thanks marque
3475,i am still sticking with my suunto i use it for all my outdoor activity including frisbee i prefer it since when i am on my bike backpacking trip for several day at a time the gps tracking just last so much longer i do think apple made a solid and rugged watch i just think we will really see the ultra shine in 2 3 more iteration i think it will just take me a bit before i lean on apple for off the grid activity
3476,i would have to have the watch charged to 100percent before a marathon otherwise it would not last me that long it is accuracy wa off too when comparing it to my garmin so we will see if it is a accurate a a garmin now
3477,800 dollar for a watch fuck no i can see 500 or 550 but 800 apple is price gouging like a mf
3478,i expect this will sell beyond expectation but many will want a smaller dimensioned one
3479,it doe not look that big on your wrist
3480,not worth it if you spend your day in an office if you hike scuba dive diving in general then yes worth it
3481,no one noticed the subtle flex that this guy drove into nyc toll aint nothing
3482,not my kind if watch it is super big amp ugly i will stick with my series 6 gold which i might have to sell i have now got a s22 ultra
3483,nah smartwatches are a product nobody asked for a complete non essential money grab by apple and others
3484,remind me of richard mille and ultra will hit
3485,i hope he doe a review on the se because i am looking to buy an apple watch and i am thinking on getting the se
3486,let is not forget about the people who want the watch just because it is dope
3487,bought a titanium wedding band year ago and it is amazingly light to me the iphone pro model need to become lighter and using titanium is essential although i honestly would be fine with the aluminum side a they are durable and light the luxury premium feel of stainless steel is borderline ridiculous
3488,those motion graphic were sick well done team the video intro never disappoints
3489,yeah well done team
3490,gabriel recchi nice
3491,absolutely getting better and better each time
3492,the neon like icon were pretty good let is say
3493,casey vibe during this vid
3494,i would get this if they get it to 7 10 day battery life currently rock the fenix 7x solar sapphire which is absolutely amazing
3495,on garmin fenix watch with solar you get the same batterie life but in day instead of hour
3496,the only review that matter
3497,ah yes let is all buy a smaller and le capable version of the computer we already carry and this time instead of protecting it with a case and keeping it securely in our pocket we can strap it to our wrist so that it get scratched and cracked even faster apple is hitting all of it mark let is all be sure to rush out and support the ultimately unsustainable scam tech industry by rushing out to spend thousand of dollar on tiny incremental improvement to useless tech
3498,nice
3499,day 1 of asking nicely if i can get a free mkbhd hoodie
3500,battery life ha kept me from buying an apple watch thus far and so naturally i wa excited for this watch until they announced the price i like it but i can not justify spending dollar800 on a watch one because i do not participate in extreme sport work in construction or anything that might necessitate that kind of design and secondly an ipad would be far more useful for what i do hopefully they will release a lower price version in aluminum but keep the battery capacity and screen size they could drop some of the ultra feature to keep the price down on a side note i get nine 9 day on a charge with my wyze 47c watch but it lack most of the advanced feature of the apple watch
3501,2000 calorie
3502,the selling point of this watch are look and excuse 99percent of buyer will not use a single one of the special feature
3503,there is absolutely no use case for myself getting a smart watch besides hating apple product i prefer good old fashioned watch mechanical quart or automatic even digital and they will last forever my mind will never change on this
3504,i am convinced there will be a pro iwatch at some point in the future
3505,i also wear a large titanium watch made by shinola the white hurricane model large watch are a style for some the apple watch ultra is not that big
3506,please list your setting what did your turn off to get that much battery life
3507,i do not use an apple watch mostly because i do not like the shape i am more of a round watch face guy
3508,for 800 buck you can buy a real decent watch this is not it
3509,so apple now care about fringe user if they did that they would have not discontinued the mini line
3510,it is ugly
3511,2 55 what watch is that in the corner
3512,68percent battery if you ask apple
3513,promise y all all these device overestimate calorie burn by like 30 50percent because it make you feel better and they have no reason not to
3514,1 11 got me good
3515,hahahahahaha hahahahaha everyone that ha a redmi band 6
3516,electric intro
3517,no black option for the casing disappointed
3518,think im gon na stick with my old 44mm apple watch se cellular more apps than i need and larger battery than the non cellular and last about 2 day got it on sale for le than dollar200 good for those that can afford the ultra have fun
3519,hey mkbhd where is galaxy watch 5 and watch 5 pro review i am still waiting for that
3520,this might be the coolest intro i have seen in year
3521,garmin watch are still better
3522,your t shirt print reminds me of something weird
3523,just a pointless update from the series 6 and 7
3524,2 day and 2 night still is only 2 full day lol
3525,probably will not get the ultra but mine is a series 4 and i can barely get through a day without line dying i have to keep theatre mode on to save battery i will probably look at getting a series 8
3526,simultaneously said nice
3527,good point about the shape it doe make the watch look more awkward but i feel that way about every apple watch i have never hated an inanimate object more ha
3528,lol so big and ugly dollar800 loser wear
3529,i sorta of want to upgrade from my scratched fitbit but it is too expensive
3530,stoked about that battery life
3531,i would like to get a watch to connect to an iphone 12 so i can see who is calling or texting for work i work out on a factory floor where it is really loud i do not really want to spend a ton of money is there anything decent you would recommend that is cheap under dollar200
3532,the comparison with casio is stupid
3533,if you want something rugged with a lot of battery get a garmin at least 2 week of battery life
3534,1 33 watch pro is owned by another company that is why the could not name it this way
3535,why i actually see a p ni head on this shirt or i am a gay or i have a lack of sex one of these two
3536,air pod pro user right here
3537,i have given up on smart watch back to good old casio with 10 year battery no hassle of charging no anxiety from erroneous reading of heart rate bp etc
3538,what is that keyboard up in the corner there at 2 46
3539,dollar800 is not that bad
3540,starting to like it ngl
3541,serious question did you put the orange band upside down on purpose or wa it unintentionally and if so why did you do that
3542,do you normally use the lefty orientation for your apple watch when not doing a review i find it difficult to use the normal way nice video
3543,a a longtime fan i think the success of this channel lie in empathy understanding that every product ha a specific user in mind and that different product make sense in different context for different people
3544,jesus christ love u so much he died on the cross for our sin and rose from the grave put your faith in jesus
3545,it is so wierd and kind of an expected thing seeing all these youtubers wearing an apple watch ultra just because it is the latest and the greatest and the most expensive thing apple ha to offer even if they do not need it or it wa not designed for them or for their activiites it wa the same thing with the mac pro or the expensive wheel or the airpods max they buy 1tb varient of iphone pro max every year just to switch it the next year without even using the full memory just because it is the top of the line model they want to get it and show it off it never help a regular viewer or the regular customer in any way most of the people can not afford such thing and will not be bothered for their everyday use review
3546,michael carter understanding consumer is a form of empathy
3547,no man that isnt empathy come on understanding consumer sentiment and product line design isnt something that should impress you
3548,most tech reviewer are tech junky and do not look through the average consumer lens whike mkbhd is the only one who doe
3549,8 55 air integration tank pressure monitoring
3550,awesome review thank you quick question you may be able to help with i have the 44mm apple watch 6 with a s m sized sport band would the small or medium size in the alpine strap be equivalent for new ultra which i have on order spoke to two apple support guy 1 said small and the other said medium keen to know your thought looking forward to tomorrow when my new ultra hopefully arrives
3551,i love the lego bonsai behind you
3552,worth it to those who can afford and for the rest nah
3553,0 09 gaaaadamn my favorite sound bit
3554,they 1000percent can anodize it at virtually no extra cost and probably still even charge more for different color anyway lol
3555,this is paving the way for the apple watch ultra pro that is going to launch next year for dollar1199
3556,hey marque do you wear your watch higher than normal on your wrist doe it not fit properly
3557,look ridiculous on the wrist like a child watch
3558,funny how you say that it ha air integration and in the very next sentence you say that the one thing missing is tank pressure monitoring those are two term that describe the same thing in diving i am looking forward to an actual diver reviewing this to see what it really is like though i am intrigued but not convinced yet
3559,like the one outside your illustration not the middle
3560,apple i giga chad buy now
3561,a a physicist scientist high tech spec ops soldier spy i must say this watch ha everything i need apple definitely know their customer
3562,no
3563,honestly if apple made an android companion app for their watch to enable thing like calling and texting i would buy one of these it is dollar1500 where i live but it would be worth it for the ruggedness and battery life i often go on long tramp in the mountain for 3 or 4 day sometimes longer no smartwatch until now ha seemed to have a good enough balance of feature ruggedness and battery life for me to consider upgrading from my current solar powered analog watch
3564,marque i am curious have you ever damaged an apple watch while practicing or playing ultimate frisbee or is durability good enough even on the regular model
3565,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
3566,man music is beast
3567,you can not anodize titanium
3568,i feel the rog phone comment i got a rog phone 6 and it will never run a game simply got it because they offer the best tech spec for me
3569,2 15 who the hell walk up stair and hold the railing like that
3570,me ngl
3571,orr just get a rolex broke bum
3572,damn bro you need some lotion on those arm
3573,i have the galaxy watch 5 pro i love it but if you think this is a big watch you have not seen anything
3574,i am convinced most of the comment are bot
3575,i could be mistaken but wa not the series 7 titanium like dollar750 or dollar800 so is not this a bargain when compared to last year is titanium offering
3576,apple win again guess it buy apple product
3577,i think a sport this watch would be perfect for is mountain biking tbh
3578,i personally would have expressed that diagram the other way around
3579,so basically if you just want a cool watch with a bunch of apps for sm navigation or whatever you loose a lot of battery for the stupid health function that constantly spy on your body unless you turn that power saver thing on is not there a usage profile setting kind of thing that doe that anyway and if not why have not the genius at apple added that from day 1
3580,if apple want me to buy their watch they are going to have to make one that work with an android phone the end
3581,i would like it in black i would never heard mkbhd saying this
3582,hey i have that bonsai tree
3583,the one thing i like about it is the bigger screen that is it please give the regular watch a bigger version apple
3584,this is not for fringe people real pro will use specific pro equipment consumer will buy this to feel more pro a marketing tactic but really the appeal is the design the battery and status it stand out and everyone know it is expensive and unique probably will be massive hit with mainstream consumer
3585,my series 7 ha already gone through multiple full ironman with no issue a bigger heavier watch is not a selling point for triathletes who pay thousand to save 50g from their bike or to decrease frontal area the main difference between our racing shoe amp regular shoe are about 25g shoe for dollar100 more i do not think many elite triathletes or endurance athlete of any sort will want an ultra over an 8
3586,i would like to add that i have done a few spartan with my 7 but it should be implied that it can handle that if it can handle a 9 hour full ironman
3587,who tf drive in nyc
3588,hey there great job a always i am not an apple user but you can slap a case on it in black of course from amazon
3589,what is the id on the keyboard in the corner
3590,the gshock you showed for comparison is small lol there are much bigger gshocks
3591,overlay
3592,production quality
3593,i wish it had a ant antenna then it would be great for cyclocross might need stick with garmin
3594,personally i will still take a garmin with a much longer battery life and better map but i do wish it had the same compatibility a apple watch do
3595,trump strong like manlyman pootin amp taliban
3596,nice john mayer g shock
3597,mkbhd how are you doing today my name is efezino from nigeria do you mind sending some of your older device to nigeria so i can start my channel getting gadget to nigeria is very difficult because of the exchange rate they are out of my price range if you do not mind i would be very grateful thanks alot for your consideration
3598,it seems no matter how crazy a tech can be thrown at mkbhd he will always gon na go back at it with a pretty good
3599,idk why people think this is what make someone a good reviewer if anything it make them terrible so nothing is good but also nothing is bad everything is somehow always just fine
3600,trust me getting a pretty good is a amazing review
3601,it is so wierd and kind of an expected thing seeing all these youtubers wearing an apple watch ultra just because it is the latest and the greatest and the most expensive thing apple ha to offer even if they do not need it or it wa not designed for them or for their activiites it wa the same thing with the mac pro or the expensive wheel or the airpods max they buy 1tb varient of iphone pro max every year just to switch it the next year without even using the full memory just because it is the top of the line model they want to get it and show it off it never help a regular viewer or the regular customer in any way most of the people can not afford such thing and will not be bothered for their everyday use review
3602,dhiraj singh he ha been on top of the game for too long matured
3603,subcinctus only good at appreciating apple
3604,we have become too complacent this watch is a mind bending technological marvel at dollar800 if we told people 100 year ago how many thing this wristwatch can do it would have caused mass hysteria
3605,that battery life still kill for most i know in those fringe group they seem to be trying to target i will stick to my fenix that i typically charge up maybe twice a month
3606,for advanced diver the apple watch ultra absolutely doe not cut it no air integration tech ccr etc but for the casual once in a while recreational diver it kind of cool nice to see apple is trying
3607,anyone know what he is practicing for
3608,this guy like everything a long a it is black
3609,3 day max battery life is rubbish especially for dollar800
3610,what stop me from getting a smartwatch full stop is that i am not allowed to wear a watch while playing football soccer here in australia because it may collide with or scratch someone while playing would be nice if the big software giant would look into chest monitor that can track step heart rate and gps
3611,i would love to see a video on all the smart watch that have long battery life
3612,dear marque appreciate if you can use the ultra with lte connectivity only to have better judgement on how long the battery can last without a mobile thank you
3613,everytime i watch an mkbhd video i think it is going to be the biggest w on whichever company let is mkbhd design their next phone drop
3614,doe this one work in space i am an astronaut and looking to upgrade my smart watch for when i go to the moon next week
3615,being a pilot i wa super excited when i saw this watch with the altimeter compass gps emergency feature and the red night mode for night flight this watch brings so much to aviation that the normal apple watch doe not have however knowing what garmin doe for aviation watch i wa a little disappointed they did not have an angle for flying garmin give you weather update metar and know what airport you are at based on it identifier ksba apple could have worked a little harder to make this an aviation watch and it would be the most complete watch ever all around though this watch look still extremely useful for aviation and i will most likely be upgrading to it
3616,the watchmetar apple watch app doe metar and taf and even provides a complication to your regular watch face granted it only doe u airport to me this one of the advantage of a smartwatch there are apps for a lot of stuff
3617,mab do not know what you want u to say about this the watch is targeted towards people who want to use it a a daily driver and clearly you are not
3618,hearing people gush about how these watch feature apply to their passion make me happy
3619,that red watch face you talk about you can nistall on every wear o watch or garmin or suunto and for le then 800 dollar watch with only 2 day battery
3620,this watch ai not smart it is a dumb notification machine it is got no angle for real they can not even do alarm right do not make your safety line a barely functioning toy
3621,marque is not a human being dear brother and sister it is confirmed he is a cyborg
3622,why can not apple make a solar watch
3623,a a person who doe crossfit and hiit regularly the ultra is an overkill but who care i have always wanted my apple watch to be bigger and that is enough to warrant the upgrade now to find the cash for it great review a always mkb
3624,the ultra name is more suitable to athlete than pro
3625,well i think to switch to apple watch we have to be very disappointed with our watch if the need arent there why switch when you have to charge ie extra work
3626,take a shot for every time marquess ha mentioned wearing an apple watch to the met gala jkjk for real this wa a great review of the the watch and line up with what i expected the biggest pull to the average watch wearer like me is the battery life but with how fast the series 7 and 8 charge the lack of a week long battery life is not so much of a detriment imo i would probably stick to the regular non ultra model despite getting the pro model in all the other category
3627,jesus died for our sin so that we can go to heaven he payed our price put your trust in jesus christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven
3628,you keep changing wrist
3629,they will add an extra 30 min battery life every time they release the replacement model then slimmer by 1mm i will wait 5 year later to get 2 5 hour extra battery life
3630,it a apple cash grab
3631,the feature might be nice but damn it look like absolute garbage
3632,the pro ha been passed around more than a blunt
3633,i swear in almost every video i have seen from you in the last month or so you have mentioned you dressed up your apple watch at the met
3634,there will be an ultra version of most everything apple make
3635,should have been the apple watch max
3636,doe he play ultimate frisbee i missed it if he said it
3637,just look to cheap for me i have had the apple watch from day one in construction hand moving transport and furniture tile gym and never broke one few scratch sometimes but just upgraded to the watch 8 in gold this time just for the crash detection a i am on the road 12 hour day remember when the gold wa over dollar10 000 lol
3638,if you want a giant fisher price looking gadget strapped to your wrist sure
3639,audio ha never been one of your strong point the voice is so echoey in this
3640,they should have done a black titanium for sure
3641,how much did you pay for it it very expensive here
3642,wrist watch in general nah
3643,can we all just take a second to appreciate how sick that dive catch 13 05 wa bravo marque
3644,skull rain abdx woah look guy we got a professional frisbee player here
3645,nah pretty ordinary
3646,ah so that is what the wouldive computer in the watch is for
3647,69percent battery nice
3648,i preordered day one and still have to wait till october 27th ugh
3649,okay but what workout were you doing bruh
3650,sport watch
3651,this watch will be a great buy in 2 year
3652,watch pro name is licensed by lg probably that is why they had to name it ultra
3653,maybe you could mention some after market band that work well for the ultra
3654,so is it better than a garmin descent
3655,i rather go for a garmin enduro 2 for a watch in that price point and if your after a watch that is rugged but i like how big the ultra is
3656,who is john mayer g shock is that
3657,i tried the series 2 and series 5 both left me disappointed a fitness watch one of my complaint wa the button not enough button to be able to do thing during run and when sweat wa everywhere maybe 1 extra button plus the crown for scrolling will fix that the native exercise apps never impressed me and did not display the data i wanted or in the configuration i wanted i like the apple watch a a smart watch and fashion statement and always wanted it to work a both but now the ultra ha the sport capability and the look is not sleek and fashionable a the base model so it still doe not work for me i will keep my garmin i guess
3658,im a simple guy i am a sucker for big watch there for this is a must cop for me
3659,this watch is great for me a a chef because there are time when the battery will just run out because i work such long day plus my cake timer and alarm are more visible on the bigger screen and the more waterproof design mean it will not break while i am washing up
3660,we have the same lego set bonsai buddy
3661,the thing is this watch can do everything but nothing really good
3662,ridiculous comment just a one example the accuracy of the heart rate sensor put every single garmin to shame unless you hook up some big adollardollar external chest strap
3663,there are several thing i love about this watch thanks for the review your perspective is always valuable a a tool for tech purchase i am considering i am upgrading from a series 5 to the ultra
3664,me too
3665,i would get the ultra but it is massive and i have a tiny wrist
3666,i am debating between the apple watch ultra or a series 8 s case i really like the sapphire glass on my series 4 but i am not sure if i still will need it or not
3667,who need animation when you can just have marque draw some clean stick figure
3668,800 it is getting crazier by the year laughable
3669,that intro sheesh fire
3670,i have seen better battery life on better looking watch for example the amazfit t rex 2 smart watch for a little over 200 dollar will last over a week and a half and look amazing with a few color option
3671,great review it also is basically the same price a a stainless steel apple watch 8 with cellular
3672,i have been wanting a smart watch this look dope af i am just not sure i can say sorry babe i did not see your message
3673,is it only me or the intro in apple video look like they were out of apple keynote so appley
3674,cerakote that is what you want
3675,i and at least two of my friend will be getting these to use a dice computer because it is still half the price of a decent dive computer
3676,right but hear me out i literally just love the product design of it and the extra battery is nice worth
3677,pro plus or max and now ultra what is the next big word to suggest it is better extreme
3678,i thought i heard something about lg copyrighting the term watch pro which could have prompted apple to use ultra
3679,excellent a usual i love how you got the industrial hike going there come to utah and we can take you on a real hike
3680,got a rolex for dollar1300
3681,a a member of the military can not buy this watch because it is not black guess we are further outside the circle than the paper
3682,i actually do not care about all the pro feature i just want it because it is a fresh new design and the battery life
3683,great video
3684,0 08 errr we need to have chat
3685,battery and price are the two thing that have stopped me from switching from a fitbit to an apple watch my fitbit can last about a week
3686,g shock ftw
3687,battery life still suck compared to a good sport watch
3688,and weirdly i wa expecting a galaxy watch 5 ultra but we got a galaxy watch 5 pro
3689,oh shit i follow the runner on insta he just ran across america a few month ago
3690,i just noticed the scar on the back of mkbhd is hand it look like he broke the same bone that i did
3691,what happened to your hand man talking about that big mark on your right hand
3692,i want it purely for the size
3693,wow 2000 calorie burned thats insane what do you eat in a day
3694,i wa hooked at the fact you could set a literal spawn point like wow
3695,800 for an apple watch then there is me remembering how much apple charged for wheel
3696,love the lego bonsai
3697,2 thousand calorie what is your diet
3698,it is 1000 euro in eu lol
3699,a a scuba diver i am worried about how long the seal is gon na last
3700,no real diver use 100m resistant watch 200m min and iso rated not sure this beat the garmin fenix 6x a a sport activity watch
3701,i want it for the night time mode battery life and screen brightness in the day i can not dive i stick to popular trail and i only run to the refrigerator but i still want one
3702,i had the color question also anyone know production that can give insight did they not offer a black to match the phon because they did not know how the watch would sell so le risk or because color would be easier to damage
3703,look forward to trying it out in person but definitely need to come in other color lot of opportunity to do color anodizing wonder if a third party could take the watch apart and do custom anodizing
3704,doe the casio have imessage no so obviously you can not really compare the battery like that because the other watch can not do nearly all the thing apple doe without hesitation
3705,lol if only they were 800 here it is euros999 in the netherlands ffs
3706,the fact that the ultra is a cellular only option ha peaked my interest none of this wa mentioned in this video great content by the way is it possible to use a cellular watch a a stand alone device granted at dollar1000 cad it can easily be viewed a overkill to cover some of the basic talk text maybe email seeing that you had the ph watch for a week do you think is possible for this cellular watch to be utilized a a independent device i would love to hear your thought on this once again great video
3707,the watch is on your right arm gross
3708,i wont lie ill be getting it just because of the design and size a i have always enjoyed the size of gshock and wont even be using most of the feature lol
3709,do you know the formula the apple watch us to calculate max heart rate is it the simple 220 age equation or is it karvonon formula asking because i heard rumor apple consulted real athlete who often use karvoneon formula for cardio training
3710,20syl
3711,visuals are amazing
3712,a someone who is into diving aaus scientific diving i am intrigued given what i know about apple watch and battery life i feel like i am veryyyyy skeptical i am assuming most diver will have a backup whether it is another watch or computer built in next to the pressure gauge i can not wait to see how it performs
3713,4o0 mt in extreme diving i have been diving for over 40 year muy garmin plus dive computer is what i use garmin give me 100 mt
3714,i would check out dc rainmaker is review of the apple watch ultra i think mkbhd is review applies more to the common person who want that little bit extra from a normal apple watch aka the more active person who doe not want to charge their apple watch everyday but the lack of native trail map for ultra distance runner and the lack of integration of power meter for triathletes is a pretty big letdown i think the cycling app is pretty much worthless on the apple watch if you are a serious cyclist or triathlete not to say that apple can not change this issue but will they want to devote the resource and money to make this happen for these reason i do not think most ultra athlete will give up their garmins etc for this watch a such i think they probably should have named it the apple watch pro rather than the ultra but i think overall it is probably the best apple watch for everyday use
3715,spot on
3716,can i play radio on an apple watch ultra
3717,can i watch movie or tv show on an apple watch ultra
3718,where is the airpods pro 2 review man
3719,mark as brownie
3720,too big for me
3721,i wonder how long it will be until we get a mkbhd brick and mortar store
3722,for you yes worth it for the majority not worth it
3723,look absolutely ridiculous on small wrist
3724,i really like the series 7 but the battery suck and you can not find any screen protector for it the ultra fulfills those issue but it look massive all the stuff added to me would seem like bloat wear and the flat screen is not a appealing a the curved that said i think i am still interested just from the battery my 7 is almost always dead before the end of the day which make me not even want to bother with it
3725,i love the innovative step taken to expand battery life this should push the casual market really well it is a shame we got this review so quickly but no galaxy watch 5 pro mention
3726,can i take photograph or video with an apple watch ultra
3727,can i delete all the fitness and health apps and service on an apple watch ultra
3728,can i watch t v on an apple watch ultra
3729,frisbee wow lame
3730,is there any point in buying an apple watch ultra if you do not have or do not want an iphone
3731,i am pumped for it bc i have pretty large wrist and my apple watch series 3 i have been wearing for what almost 5 year now look tiny imo on my wrist i often buy the big silicone strap that you put the watch into to beef it up a little bc i like the look of a larger watch like the g shock or breitling avenger
3732,what are the best entertainment apps for an apple watch ultra
3733,marque i admire the way u can break thing down ie little stick figure chart great idea
3734,doe the apple watch ultra have specialised website to view on it
3735,can we talk about how the graphic team killed it on the intro on this one possibly the best intro yet
3736,you say bring you into the ecosystem a dope pusher on the corner say get them hooked potato potahto
3737,can you have a video phone call on an apple watch ultra or even a regular phone call on it
3738,i never liked apple watch because battery life ha been shit on them all i ended up buying an inexpensive watch with 1 week battery life and doe 100percent if what i needed in the apple watch
3739,before smart watch people bought watch based on appearance and quality ie rolex tag heuer etc these watch did not do much more than tell time accurately no more than le expensive watch with this watch and capability it can be a fashion status statement for some it is a cool dollar800 watch but would be better in matte black
3740,can you have music playlist on an apple watch ultra
3741,having had a galaxy watch for three year i forget that battery life is so bad for the apple watch over and over it is touted that this new apple watch ha such great battery life but it is still not a good a i have come to expect same with ruggedness it is just a non issue with the watch i have three year in basically not even a scratch obviously this is way way better in other way it way more expensive and three year newer but those feature especially feel like just geting to the hygiene level to make it properly reliable to where it is a non issue
3742,i wish they anodise it
3743,he missed the point it is like the big truck and suv in the u 99percent of ppl do not need it
3744,exactly i wish mine came in orange or gold no color for the ultra
3745,do you get news alert and email on an apple watch ultra
3746,i do not really need it it arrives friday
3747,i still say it look like something a child would wear
3748,can we discus the way you are holding the yoke please
3749,anodising in an aluminium process only and is not at all durable
3750,i am a scuba and uw photography instructor for a major university you want to test this while diving i will certify you for free
3751,damn the g shock ref 6900 pt80 nice easter egg
3752,get it done in dlc thatd be cool to see
3753,the watch look really good
3754,amazing battery upgrade glad i bought one just hope i get it soon 4 to 6 week after unpacked is a long time device should be ready 1 week after unpacked or two day
3755,i am actually interested in watching ultimate freebie now that shot with him playing looked amazing
3756,can you watch video on the apple watch ultra
3757,800 dollar for 2 day and i payed 100 dollar for over 7 day apple v huawey
3758,marque did not anyone tell you girl wear watch on the right hand and men on the left your choice just saying
3759,i think apple need to rethink the band and how it attache to the watch i also have a narrow wrist and i would find that thing to be cumbersome to wear
3760,this is for all the people that said nice at the same time a mkbhd
3761,my series 5 which i am replacing ha 88percent battery health and i have to charge more than once a day i have to run the display at max brightness to read it in all condition maybe it is because i am getting older and the eye are not all they once were but that also drain the battery more i figure the ultra will age much more gracefully for me extended battery life and brightness mean even a component degrade they will probably still be a good a the normal watch of course you get the extra stuff too though at 69 i will not be climbing everest or shooting the rapid but no one ha ever cursed extra durability or battery life i will probably wear it with a pedestrian apple leather link band and will enjoy the bigger display and the keyboard ever try to draw a password on a aw5 an exercise in frustration best to have your phone nearby so you can use it is keyboard
3762,the amazing thing is i am 12 i have a 14 pro and a series 8 and i have the airpods pro on pre order
3763,take a look at the garmin fenix 7x that is what a smart watch sound be for endurance athlete
3764,tbh i would not buy anything apple i wa fully into it but nah i need freedom over the tech i use
3765,i just want them to come out with facetiming with the watch lol
3766,they had a black titanium option for the series 7 it is an anodized coating not paint hard to scratch my series 7 titanium ha been abused hiking climbing swimming backpacking daily use and still look great so other color are totally possible
3767,this is the only watch i would use a not so easy to break scratch and good battery life although i am not willing to pay for one and battery is not near enough to what i would like so i shall pas
3768,look like cheap toy lmao super fat too
3769,nice to see that the nike band still fit it
3770,what size is your wrist mine is 150mm i doubt the ultra will fit and not look like a tablet on my wrist
3771,stupid as tesla
3772,just now noticed marque wear watch on his right hand like putin
3773,idk i have never worn watch and i had one smart watch year ago and i can not say i find them useful for really anything that i can not just do with my phone in more detail and can not say this especially for dollar800 ha attracted me even slightly granted i do not give a shit about tracking my daily health stats so that is probably the core issue
3774,screw the watch the animation and production of your video are beautiful and amazing
3775,the met gala flex wa cool
3776,this will get buried in the comment i am gay
3777,this transition are sick bro and the intro wa fire keep it up bro
3778,i know it is a great watch but for most people smartwatches third it is price will be enough for daily use plus it look like crap
3779,i will fully admit that i am not the segment this watch is targeting that having been said it ha a lot of good feature but it is still the ugliest apple product since at least the mid 90 how the hell did this design make it off the drawing board
3780,thats a left handed watch
3781,i am looking for a watch you can wear to listen to music while underwater and that is what i am waiting for nothing seems to have that capability
3782,can you make a video on your setting to get that much battery life
3783,i want to see zack testing the ultra
3784,excuse me sir excuse me your dope
3785,gread video
3786,since this watch is not called apple watch pro maybe there will be a pro coming also the price of this watch is insane
3787,are there any exclusive watch face
3788,ultimate frisbee practice is this like a recreational team that you play on or a school
3789,i am attracted to it strictly for the flat glass and the night mode face
3790,marque love to namedrop the met gala lol great content
3791,how doe the amazfit gts get to 1 month of use with only one charge are those 2 day really worth that amount of cash
3792,aside from being a hiker runner and gym rat me this allows people that love going on long walk to leave their phone behind and not fret about lte phone call from the wrist draining precious battery life while tracking workout this is a huge win mine is on the way
3793,aside from being a hiker runner and gym rat me this allows people that love going on long walk to leave their phone behind and not fret about lte phone call from the wrist draining precious battery life while tracking workout this is a huge win mine is on the way
3794,brushed titanium would have been a cool finish no issue with paint scratching off or anything
3795,if people pay million for a richard mille then this is a steal i would buy it but recently bought a 7 series
3796,and the apple watch ultra is still not enough i will be sticking to my garmin fenix
3797,what is black ish silicone band
3798,800 for a wearable damn cost a much a the phone
3799,just a thought i think there is another reason they called this watch ultra instead of pro i believe that they are going to release a watch that slot in between so they did not want to take up the pro name similar to the airpods just make sure that when it happens you all remember you heard it here first
3800,question why wa your watch in theater mode because doe not that effect your result a theater turn off your screen unless your press the watch i have fix this day in an day out for people
3801,garmin equivalent the fenix last 30 hour if you use gps
3802,we never got the galaxy watch video
3803,tech is boring now i think we need more software based feature
3804,ruining more outdoor activity with useless technology no one need a dollar800 watch to go scuba diving bunch of snob you people can not even leave the house without a computer on your wrist hopefully you people just get distracted and drown so we do not have to deal with you crackheads
3805,you have got some discrepancy with detail on apple watch diving depth switching between 300m to 30m fyi
3806,the battery may be good but my 2 year old fitbit last a week
3807,you from ny too never knew guess it could be jersey too
3808,i have a pro trek watch a well it is amazing for battery life in the summer i get nervous in winter tho cu we do not see the sun for 5 month lol
3809,not sure about that 2000 calorie workout loll i am sure it wa a tough workout but not 2000 calorie tough
3810,i believe apple will make a pro watch at some point not targeting athlete a the ultra but people that want some extra battery life for example i think they will kill the se and the they will have the watch a baseline pro a bit more expensive with better battery life maybe a more square design and some extra feature and the watch a they have now that would be interesting
3811,damn bro how rich are you
3812,i find it so cool that he is a professional ultimate frisbee player and a big youtuber
3813,siren what mind blowing thanks for sharing this beautiful apple video marque brownlee
3814,the sound byte with the practice is
3815,i love watching review for thing i will not ever buy
3816,this just doe not compete with garmin watch for fitness i mean the amount of gps tracking time you get is a joke also it is fricken enormous and look stupid but whatever apple make it so people will think it is cool
3817,i really hope this watch face come to other watch like the series 7 honestly
3818,this watch is so nice it is like an apple watch mixed with an omnitrix
3819,love it
3820,no wonder you are thin 2k calorie
3821,i am one of those people on the outside both professionally and leisurely my polar watch currently the vantage v2 had this kinda battery life and usually even much better for year now granted they do not do stock call whatsapp or anything of that fashion but they are excellent fitness tracker provide a weather forecast and other stuff it is all i need no le and not much more but most important they last sometimes for 8 or 10 day if apple can match that i will buy their watch a well until then it is garmin or polar for me
3822,inward crowd gang rise up
3823,69percent nice i see what you did there
3824,i have an apple watch 6 and it last 1 and a half day or even more
3825,the battery life thing is not true my series 3 ha lasted a week without charge on multiple occasion
3826,a 100m water resistance rating is not good enough for diving only surface swimming
3827,love your channel marque
3828,apple could really put garmin on notice if they added a native golf app i have to imagine there are more golfer out there than diver i imagine with the gps gyroscope etc they could really tie in tempo shot tracking elevation and even weather into a compelling package for a lot of garmin golf user
3829,thing is garmin got a watch for every need so far apple had only 1 cheap 1 higher priced and 1 expensive option they are slowly starting to cater to specific need just wait a few year
3830,over 1 5 million view in under 8 hour of this creator posting this video amazing great creator
3831,imagine paying dollar800 for a watch that will be outdated in a year and start slowing downb
3832,so it is finally another watch that can last just a long a the galaxy watch classic
3833,so from saturday to monday you switched arm several time did you change the setting that tell the watch on which arm it is wa that part of your testing i guess i just want to know why you switched arm that often
3834,i am the outsider no apple nothing in my world
3835,getting this for the improved battery and gps that and i have always thought the regular apple watch wa too small
3836,nobody is talking about screen size apparently it is the actual same a series 8 just bigger skin is the screen actually bigger
3837,titanium is anodizeable but not in black probably that chassis is anodized also because anodized titanium is also stronger
3838,yall in the comment section even real
3839,i never thought that there wa a sport called ultimate frisbee
3840,can you wear it upside down and tell it you are left handed ie so the crown is on the outside
3841,i never understood why some right handed people wear their watch on their right wrist most do not so it doe not get banged up a much
3842,i play frisbee to a high standard and would never wear a big watch at the same time
3843,the intro is congrats team
3844,why is no one mentioning that to access the dive computer you need to pay a subscription fee i know this is not entirely on apple is end it is the app developer but it is insanely greedy like what
3845,nah it is too big i used 44mm for year i switched to 41mm last year and it is the size i am going to use a it made me realize how much comfort i wa missing out on all those year using the bigger apple watch 41mm feel like having nothing on your wrist while the new bigger screen is just barely enough most of the time if they make a smaller version sometimes in the future i may get one a 43mm apple watch ultra would be nice
3846,i am looking at the se on my wrist and it look like technology of the past
3847,i think the name ultra focus on thing that creator or athlete do like the mac ultra is for like photoshop and photography and all that and the ultra watch is focused on training athletic stuff
3848,i wonder if you can use your old apple watch for work and than switch to the pro for weekend and such
3849,i highly doubt that the 2000cal burned is accurate
3850,garmin instinct 2
3851,what camera wa used to shoot the game like this 13 07
3852,so i am a paramedic due to hand hygiene issue we can not wear a wrist watch anymore i got the og apple watch we could wear washable watch then and then protocol soon changed i upgraded to a s4 and i wear an armband strap my biggest fear issue is that on my bicep arm it is much more likely to become damaged at work i have always bought the stainless model sapphire screen le likely to scratch that is now cellular only having to buy an expensive model v the risk of damage at work is the sole reason i have not upgraded for year i will be getting an ultra to wear on my upper arm at work and then slide down my arm for when i am away from the ambulance
3853,wr100 doe not mean much you know proper dive watch start from wr200 iso certified and above sapphire is not very durable material yes it is very scratch resistant but it is brittle which is not a thing you want in supposedly rugged watch you want plastic or mineral crystal for such thing the battery is a joke no watch should be charged that often two week is the bare minimum worrying about your damn watch battery dying is just not what those hardcore user want
3854,why are you holding the wheel like that mk at 00 12
3855,i have been waiting for this banger to release ree hee hee hee
3856,do you know when the embargo on the airpods end im planing to ge them and want a review
3857,man editing game is
3858,800dollar watch what else apple
3859,solid unbiased review
3860,i wonder if they will save the pro name for a new tier watch size battery etc of the ultra but le focused towards extreme like the ultra is i would love a bigger brighter longer lasting watch
3861,i heard that another company i think lg but i could be wrong had copyrighted watch pro and so there might have been issue with using apple watch pro but who actually know
3862,regarding other color a black watch would be harder to see if you are running a marathon in the rain scuba diving in murky water or hiking in a dark area you want your watch to be very very visible not just the screen but the frame where the button are found this watch wa clearly designed like a big tough truck to do a job not to be something you might wear out to dinner and look sleek and elegant of course if it sell very well apple will probably offer it in other color in the future
3863,awesome watch and feature but way too massive for me
3864,i am older are the speaker noticeably louder on call my wrist are not huge so i am going to try it on in the store on the 23rd i kind of wish the regular series 8 with the sapphire screen wa actually a little cheaper than the ultra pretty much the same price i am on a series 4 with the sapphire screen and it never scratched so i have been pleased i hope i waited long enough for the upgrade to be significan not since i buy a lot in the apple ecosystem i have moved out of the yearly upgrade to every 3 or 4 year because apple slow roll the new feature
3865,a a person who doe triathlon i think that for this domain garmin is 100percent better
3866,loved the intro
3867,ultimate frisbee player the ultra version of a frisbee player
3868,man your video are awesome
3869,i am trying to justify me watching a video about an dollar800 watch never mind me sharing my food stamp money with apple
3870,great review a always
3871,i ordered one instantly on day one after the conference i may not need all it sport feature but i surely do want bigger display longest batter life ever and the brightest screen for outdoor use
3872,mkb what is wrong with pov camera sensor it ha a spot in right area couple of time in some previous video i thought my screen wa dirty but naaah
3873,let alone forty
3874,biggest reason why someone me do not own an apple watch is money lol
3875,tbh if i am buying a watch that is the same price a my phone i am getting a nice watch not apple not to say apple watch are not nice tho
3876,you would think that the watch having a screen would mean that you can wear it on your right hand and not have it in reverse btw just noticed you are a right handed watch wearer
3877,wdym you can reverse it lol setting gt general gt orientation gt digital crown side gt left right
3878,that orange one look perfect for this watch
3879,again and hopefully for the last time wr100 doe not mean water resistant up to 100m do you research right
3880,water resistant up to 50m 160ft
3881,dear marque your black solo loop you hab in some shot is that the same length you had for your standard 44 45mm watch because i wonder if the fixed length band will still fit bigger but thicker watch so the band still fit the same or not
3882,bro wtf 2100 calorie burned
3883,meanwhile picture me a broke college student i am sitting here using a 5 buck smartwatch from aliexpress
3884,it is 40 meter which is roughly 130 foot
3885,49mm jesus how do people have such big hand i have a 40mm watch and that is fine for my wrist the 44mm version felt like it wa too big and when just moving around the house i noticed it being too uncomfortable for me
3886,the best smartwatch
3887,im good ill keep my series 7 your job is to help apple sell it
3888,no lol it meant for sport
3889,battery life is too important for me and the ultra is still super shit at it i will keep my normal huawei one with recharge every 2 week also no offline map unless 3rd party offer that short sighted
3890,battery life minimum must be 14 day my garmin fenix 6 pro solar hold a least 9 to 13 day
3891,great review a always got my watch series 8 wanted to change the strap and immediately i got a scratch on it ridiculous on top of it the midnight strap will not fit in smoothly
3892,apple dropped the bag by not letting this watch be charged by the sun how is this meant for the outdoorsy adventure type when you only have a certain amount of hour before it dy lol
3893,i luv it i love that everything is bigger
3894,please apple just give u a reflective transflective display quit trying to fight the sun with photon you are so close to practicality
3895,you would have to be mad to swap a fully featured proven dive computer for a 100wr static pressure tested apple watch
3896,i thought i wanted this watch but the more i think about it maybe i just want a normal apple watch and then use the extended battery feature
3897,get a life man
3898,what who maques he legit ha one but ok
3899,idk my 40 buck timex ironman keep kicking as
3900,i would like to have these 2 3 day of autonomy on the normal apple watch and a week on the apple watch ultra or what name the next ultra will have apple add this on your todo list
3901,i find it funny that samsung and apple switched name on pro and ultra for their top tier watch i wonder who did that first and if the other one looked at it and said alright since you did that we will take your naming scheme
3902,my stickman seems to be still off the chart no apple watch if it doe not work a a standalone device in their ecosystem
3903,doe not come close to replacing the sport gps watch the battery life is not good enough for people who run ultra marathon given the name of the watch and the fact they had scott jurek promoting it i find it to be a bit of a joke and a fraud
3904,if you are not a scuba diver please keep your comment to yourself if you recently received your scuba certification a a result of the apple watch do not do it your life literally depends on a dive computer though there are alternative you can use such a navy table etc if you are considering using an apple watch a a dive computer you almost certainly do not know what dive table are or how to react if your computer fail but if you do your probably will not use it a your primary computer now i can see recreational air 21 diver using it a a backup maybe i say maybe because you can get a dedicated dive computer fully loaded and with all the feature you can think form the best reputable brand for 600 buck which of cheaper than the apple watch at the end is just using the right tool for the job i use apple watch myself and i think they are the best smart watch but dive computer no thanks i am okay with my teric a main and perdix ai a backup
3905,way too expensive for me a lot more useful thing can be done with that dollar800
3906,get a garmin fenix 7 or an epic 2
3907,why do not u review galaxy watch 5 a well and compare both watch
3908,can not wait to get this tell myself that i am going to do something really cool with it and only ever use it for going to the shop
3909,i came for only to see aesthetic speech of mkbhd
3910,look like something bio shock character would wear
3911,the intro is a dream thank you
3912,okay a soon a i hear you play ultimate frisbee i just can not take you serious or watch your review
3913,interested about the scar on your hand
3914,lot of black titanium faced golf driver out there black can be done
3915,reading the comment really open your eye to how many people can benefit from this watch or fit there need put different perspective in my self and make me realize oh i do that too did not think of that therefor giving me a good reason to see this watch being used on my every day lifestyle
3916,who with sense of style would dress up and use an apple watch lol unless you know nothing about style and fashion
3917,if you are broke just say that
3918,ugly watch
3919,can i keep your drawing those stick figure
3920,it is absolutely hideous
3921,i know it is all preferable and what make you comfortable but i can not help but keep thinking he is wearing the watch upside down why would you want the crown facing your elbow where you need to claw your finger weird to reach it should not you have the crown pointed to you hand in every close up shot he took it kept going through my mind to the point i wa not even watching the video just pondering this lol love the vids bro keep on with the tech
3922,remember when they had the gold apple watch for like thousand of dollar and all rich people bought them technology change now they probably trashed them just because they can
3923,would be cool to see you review a highend garmin or polar ect to give you some perspective of the super high end smart watch world for yourself
3924,overpriced and huge monstrous square doe not even look like a watch
3925,the watch will be too big for my wrist and i will not be needing all these outdoor sport feature
3926,apple us the word pro for the function only a hardcore user want sure mate one question though are you by any chance a tech youtuber ever heard of m1 ultra
3927,wish they had an altimeter for u skydiver
3928,garmin is better
3929,the reason i am considering buying one of these flat screen curved screen are the worst thing to happen to mobile electronics because screen protector are inefficient and sometimes un doable if a fingerprint sensor is in the display samsung had to know about this before they introduced this plague onto the market but for some reason every engineer threw logic out of the window because they look cool or something it is the main reason i switched ecosystem no stupid curved screen or in screen fingerprint sensor imagine my frustration when i buy a series 7 apple watch and find my actual worst nightmare a flimsy curved screen that scratch if you look at it too often
3930,apple wa not able to use apple watch pro because watch pro is trademarked by lg i believe
3931,i do not think marque is a good reviewer for this watch is target consumer
3932,pen and paper stuff ahh few moment later eeeerh which circle do i fit
3933,do this for the new samsung watch pro
3934,i really do not care
3935,are you going to review the galaxy watch 5 pro
3936,how viable do you think it is for people who want to leave their phone at home
3937,the only two thing that keep me away from it are the design and the price
3938,i would buy this if it had a physical sim card
3939,fuckssake smartwatches are big and ugly
3940,how would you f up your hand
3941,i have a black apple edition titanium apple watch so they know how to do it
3942,will you make a review for apple watch 8
3943,i am pretty sure u can not burn 2000 calorie in 3hr workout unless you are top tier athlete source gregg doucette
3944,bro he is look him up
3945,800dollar man that thing cost 1100dollar here in
3946,a an apple fan it is worth it for sure
3947,my mind worth it my wallet nah
3948,idk why you need to talk for so long about apple naming convention who care
3949,me here rockin the series 3
3950,my man telling about the met gala thing twice till now
3951,what even wa that intro thats an apple ad it so good love the visuals
3952,just a questio are you left hande marque
3953,definitely an informative amp detailed video about the ultra ordered mine on 9 20 should be receiving it no later than nov 1 been participating in spartan ocr event since 2015 i can not wait to take it through the spartan race when i get it aroo aroo
3954,i will never need any of those feature i just want it
3955,i heard that it will be very costly to repair so apple care is highly recommended
3956,imagine the smell on his wrist after he finally take it off
3957,those battery stats are based on a brand new device 6 month in it is gon na degrade a hell of a lot
3958,will people still make case for these or is there just no need now i have an s5 that is always in a case i fix atm safe and other bank equipment so always have my hand in something the case ha taken some bump and bruise
3959,these intro wow
3960,i want to know if it would be great for airsoft
3961,it absolutely mind blowing that someone would voluntarily give their sleep data to big tech
3962,i ordered one just for the gps
3963,garmin is better
3964,i bet shaq will buy the apple watch ultra lol
3965,i disagree about the size in this video on your wrist it doe not look big
3966,i am thinking about buying a ultra because of the material i am a psycho that baby it is electronic device so having a resistant watch would be great for my anxiety
3967,when would you do galaxy watch 5 pro
3968,the instagram mugger can not wait to catch someone slipping with that dollar800 on their wrist
3969,that battery life on the watch world is very true i bought a digital watch when i wa like 6 for dollar20 i am 22 now and it is still powered up i do not get it lmao
3970,fenix 7 is king
3971,any way apple creates an android app for this watch
3972,i for one working at an apple store absolutely have to get it dealing with the possibility of my watch ever going below 80percent battery charge ha given me nightmare for year but nothing will satisfy me more than knowing that i can absolutely flex on my colleague the amount of sim tray ejection tool i could store on the wristband of this refined piece of technology would embarrass every other technical specialist working around me truly a no brainer to spend used car money on something i will never use to it full potential the average person getting the apple watch ultra
3973,truly the 2022 title
3974,i am still confused by mkb is review of this watch how it sound like he is been asked not to mention garmin in any specific way garmin user will never make the shift here are some reason with garmin watch battery life is measured in week rather than day support for a huge number of sensor unbelievably detailed running and other exercise metric offline garmin map garmin pacepro and popularity map the awesome flashlight the ability to be operated completely using push button should you not want to use touch there is also the availability of specialised watch such a the pilot watch the garmin tactic with applied ballistics and many many more these are just thing that are not supported on the apple watch and will probably never get there off line music garmin pay and sleep tracking need not be mentioned because they are available on the apple watch
3975,juicy aul spec but god damn it is ugly
3976,the fact that it doe not tell you tank pressure or depth past 40m is fairly dangerous so it would not be a good idea to take it cave diving or any other deep sea stuff
3977,on the one hand it is very expensive on the other hand it doe not posse even a tenth of the beauty of an expensive analog watch comparing it to an expensive analog watch all these smart watch look cheap of course it is a matter of taste but i would recommend a look at those beautiful watch with their beautiful inner working
3978,apple should call it the fat watch it look terrible on the wrist
3979,this is the kind of battery that should be expected you got this life out of fitness tracker a few year ago and it is super useful to have
3980,bro we get it you went to the met gala lol how many time you gon na mention it

3985,4 13 they have had black titanium watch for year they are probably going to add it a a new feature next year that is what they did when they released ceramic and then titanium they always leave black for the year after
3986,i would pay dollar800 for a watch i will not pay dollar800 for a smartwatch the dollar800 smartwatch with all it is feature will reach an eol and be useless in under a decade and i am being generous the dollar800 watch i can give to my grandchild and it will still do what it wa designed to do tell time
3987,your little stick figure explanation ignored the stainless steel and hermes user
3988,what sport is marque doing 3 hour workout session damn

3990,the quality of these video will never be matched

3995,hideous with the protruding bezel look like an older model design
3996,ok sparton race runner do not need this let is not get too excited maybe a triathlon runner yeah but not just someone doing an instagramable sparton run
3997,falcon heavy t shirt
3998,shocker person that ha literally everything they get sent to them from sponsor such a apple and samsung recommend to buy those product regardless of usefulness price and even functionality ask yourself do i really need to spend almost 1000 dollar on something that will be outdated in a few year and be almost worthless or invest it into something like an actual dive watch that ha real value oh and on the topic of the satellite waypoint and navigation stuff most of you people that get iphone tout that is so secure and safe look up a program called pegasus yeah satellite tracking is for sure never gon na backfire get fucked
3999,i do marathon climbing hike and extreme sport okay it can do almost everything but is it worth 800 dollar or 1000 euro is here in the netherlands
4000,0 38 thing i am most impressed with is how far down his wrist he can wear his watch samsung you have to shove about an inch above the wrist bone
4001,nah
4002,i wan na see someone taking watch ultra to trek mount everest would be wonderful to see apple watch surviving in harsh summit environment
4003,pancake 12 58
4004,pilot precise rt gang
4005,i am buying it just to flex that is all
4006,i want it but in black im going to wait a bit i have huge wrist and im clumsy i want the bigger screen need the ruggedness
4007,that watch is huuuge
4008,also good for u aussie that live near the beach and just want to leave the watch on when swimming
4009,frisbee i wish they would do a smartwatch with no fitness rubbish i just want notification airpod control and apple pay that is it come on apple make it happen plus an aod
4010,i had health issue and my apllewatch 7 immediately alert me i wa experiencing a atrial fib i got to the doc for a real ecg impressive same result the doc wa shocked i got an apple watch the day after anyway straight to the er and then to icu 24 hour later i had a cardio versione in italian a littorio procedure share the out black your hart at the right rime in 48 hour i wa dismissed and now i am running like a horse thanks apple tnx tech in general and thanks to all you guy who promote and explain all this to the people clearly i have all the doc to prove my story i just ordered my new 8 ultra and i will never stay without an apple watch for long
4011,i spent almost 1500 last year on apple is hermez i do not even wear it and when i do it is just to check time
4012,i am sad they did not make one that people with smaller wrist could wear comfortably i am a 5 3 female and there is no way the apple watch ultra would not look ridiculous on my wrist i wish they would curve the surface that touch your skin so it follows the curve of the wrist better i think that would make it more comfortable too
4013,do you shower with the watch on
4014,i use the garmin 6x pro solar and it a great idea to combine a photovoltaic collector with the apple watch it a proven technology and would surely resolve the main problem of apple watch which is battery life
4015,what is the laptop is brand at 10 36
4016,who designed that shirt lol
4017,john mayer g shock cameo is a welcome addition
4018,apple know people will buy it just to buy it because nobody want the cheaper version of anything honestly all i do with my apple watch is look at time it is actually a hassle using it at the gym this is just my personal opinion
4019,good video but it make no sense to compare sport watch to a smartwatch like aw with the sportwatch you have an infinite battery but you do not have the multitude of smart thing you can have with an aw mine will arrive on monday ultra version and i will use it for swimming trial motocross running ok i could do the same thing and i did them with my aw7 but i would have to use rugged band to prevent damage with the ultra i would have to overcome this problem we have the satellite connection useful when you go out on an excursion the aforementioned sport watch do not have it i can call the emergency service if i have a problem and i only went out with the watch fenix suunto garmin casio you can not do that so let is not generalize the speech obviously if a child buy it to be a jerk at school then it is completely useless but it wa designed for certain people a bit like the macbook pro many do not need it the air would be enough but they prefer to spend for the power that they will not use
4020,the ultra is a hard pas for the same price you can get a solar garmin edition for longer battery life topography map and more detailed fitness performance tracking
4021,catboy an inreach mini is optional but a lot of people have it like myself a a dedicated satellite communicator that i bring on backcountry trip it is small doe not take up space and ha more tracking and satellite communication function than the ultra therefore more dependable you do not get the garmin for it is ui you get it for it capability that help grow you into a stronger athlete
4022,yeah exactly garmin suunto and coros user will not be swayed by this i do not think we get way better battery life and way better training tracking feature for le money
4023,wait they said wr50 for dive down to 40 meter deep not wr100 for 100 meter it still say not to be used for diving below 40 meter water resistance is not permanent and can diminish over time is apple is website
4024,in the world of watch size and shape do not matter a much a exclusivity so i think you can dress up just about any watch
4025,i am definitely going to be picking this one up solely for the more durable build i will use some of the new feature a well but the larger beefier case by itself make it worth it to me also a a side note digging the use of the peter mckinnon puzzle box in the pic
4026,for me except for battery it almost fight with garmin is watch
4027,maybe because samsung ha already taken the pro word for watch
4028,i am sorry but for a dollar800 watch that battery is horrible i have a huawei gt2e smart watch which i use for regular training and that battery last about a week and take about 30 min 1 hour to charge the fun part is that everything the apple watch can do so can mine do not be stupid buy a similar clock for dollar600 le than the shit watch ultra
4029,hey sick intro
4030,a a frequent diver the watch doe have an immediate appeal seeing it doe what my normal dive watch doe plus more but i think i would have to wait for the product to stay out long enough so that big dive agency like naui may actually test the watch and deem if it is safe or a good investment it still quite a bit of money but at least if it work you are getting a dive watch that can do other thing than be a dive watch
4031,it run safe algorithm that many major computer brand use it will be fine for the recreational diver apple partnered with huish which is a monopoly dive company to make this happen so i have complete faith in it a a recreational dive computer think about what a dive computer is it is basically a pressure sensor and a tissue algorithm and like i said the algorithm is one used with many major brand that have not gotten sued for getting people bent i doubt they would mess it up especially with a big name dive brand backing them naui instructor
4032,it ha diving certification
4033,i have been using the series 2 since release and now since the latest iphone update ha made it not compatible with my phone anymore guess i am due for an upgrade
4034,review these smartwatches please marque suggestion f nix 7 47mm solar edition or standard edition standard edition give the same hour a this new apple watch if you have gps mode on 24 7 in all device it is only really used during an activity if using gps occasionally 1 gps activity day like most all do amp used gps for 2hr day it will last a bit over a week until you get to 20percent that standard edition is dollar699 99 solar edition dollar799 99 add some hour assuming some exposure to sun did the math with 2 hr dayof gps use on standard edition you will be going down 8 8percent per day solar edition you will be going down 6 92percent per day regardless to 20percent it will be 1 week with this on both of them
4035,just seeing the price make it an instant nah how absurd
4036,the only reason i do not have an apple watch is it atrocious battery life a week two is an absolute minimum
4037,i cringed in real life when you said you wore your apple watch at the met gala with your tux lol anyway great review
4038,the ultra look good but there are some thing i am still concerned about the touchscreen of my current applewatch becomes intermittently unresponsive when wet a a swimmer triathalete it is very frustrating the option to use touch or button on the garmin 955 is appealing additionally i like the ability of the garmin to show me structured workout either from garmin connect training peak or humango
4039,okay but i absolutely love your shirt man
4040,i wanted the orange alpine loop but that is not gon na be available till october i am just got the green alpine
4041,battery life is disgusting smh hopefully apple can figure it out garmin take the cake right now when apple get the battery right we shall see what really is going to piss people off is when apple come out with a better battery life yet this one is only lasting 3 day but thank you apple for finally acknowledging the athlete solar charging is king
4042,attention all people watch are designed to be worn on your left wrist thank you for coming to my ted talk
4043,my realme watch 2 last for 10 day but ok
4044,so now hiker have two life saving machine since they also had to have the iphone 14 pro max
4045,mkbhd no longer make review he is just producing high quality advertising for these company unsubscribed
4046,the gahdam caught me off guard 0 10
4047,i would love to buy an apple watch if it did not need an iphone
4048,to me this watch look cheap
4049,my garmin epix i used for a 100 miler i turned off all the feature and had wrist gesture mode only wore it for 22 hour and had 77percent battery left when i finished
4050,great detailed review
4051,can we get a radiation reading on the watch
4052,or rf exposure reading
4053,you thought we would not notice upside down watch but i did
4054,smug intro
4055,a garmin watch cost le and last longer on gps mode than this thing in smartwatch mode
4056,the battery life will start diminishing after the first week or so when you start wearing your watch from day one of course the watch will last you two day two night that is with all new product so i am afraid your assessment is slightly misleading
4057,sorta wonder if they reserved the pro title for a pro version of the normal apple watch with higher end spec if it looked better and more like a regular watch with the ultra is spec i would be all in
4058,1000dollar in finland
4059,my 20 dollar watch go for about 8 day and 8 night ofc it doesnt have so many feature and probably not accurate either but i do not use that feature anyways now a i used to in the beginning so for nearly 40th the price of apple seems a good deal
4060,i am all apple everything excepts for the apple watch gon na take me a lot to switch you are going to need to show me it can do gps for 36 hour
4061,your chanel is becoming embarrassing your clearly paid by apple
4062,i am going to use it like a person who paid their money for it and not give a damn what other people think
4063,best review thank you
4064,hell nooo dollardollar is not a factor it is just ridiculous to pay 800dollar for a square face smart watch that make you look like a douche just like there overpriced headphone we live in a monkey see monkey do world so if the have nots think that watch will make it look like they have dollardollar then they will try to buy it
4065,the lego bonsai tree nice touch
4066,it becomes a brick if you ever stop suckling the apple teat
4067,broo the animation in this video are amazing
4068,anybody here seeing samsung ad on all apple product review
4069,it is an easy decision to decide between the two if you are paying for the watch to have 4g 5g then go for that if you are only looking for wifi then stick with the 7 unless you really want the crash feature
4070,useful feature when you are strictly left handed there is a left handed mode
4071,i do not need any of those extra feature really i would buy it just for the rugged look
4072,i want every second recording for my ultras but the awu is a nice backup watch that i can wear every day a well
4073,also it need more button my garmin w touch screen is terrible when it get wet it go wonky i turn the touch off and use the button to change music and screen seamlessly
4074,i wa on the fence between the midnight and the graphite series 7 mkbhd just settled that for me once and for all thank you
4075,i could not make it through your video and your child is drawing of people around circle who care what target demographic that apple wa trying to hit i am amazed you actually have that many subscriber judging from this idiotic review tell u more about the watch and not who this watch is for
4076,i wish they would just improve the battery for normal watch most people i know that are interested in smart watch myself included just did not wan na charge the watch every night
4077,theater mode
4078,imagine being on mark is ultimate frisbee team
4079,now i really need a galaxy watch 5 pro review
4080,even though this dude is crazy rich famous and get these product for free i at least appreciate him attempting to understand the average consumer haha
4081,i am a chubby and lazy truck driver with a small wrist basically for me the only reason for an ultra it is the extra toughness compared to normal apple watch or se also the fact that i still use my fossil gen 5 because the watch it is the last one not updated to apple ecosystem and this year i might update to an apple watch also if you compare the price of series 8 titanium with cellular the price it is similar to ultra so i kinda like the ultra even if i do not know how to swim
4082,i would like to have it just for the battery life alone lol all the extra stuff would just be a bonus
4083,two day is not much juice for back country hike
4084,calorie burned is so weird i will run the same marathon a a friend his watch will say 5 000 mine will say 2 500 i did a 77 mile ultra and it said i only burned 6 700 calorie it wa 22 hour and 15 000 foot of elevation gain garmin fenix
4085,it is ugly af i want the feature but hate the design
4086,this will not replace my garmin descent mk2i but i will not wear the garmin every day because it is huge
4087,the intro is really better than apple own ad not gon na lie
4088,i love the apple ha made the ultra they have gone below down with scuba diver they have gone across with runner and hiker and they have gone up a bit with mountaineer but what about people who really go up paragliders skydiver wingsuit flyer a good verio matched with awesome gps would have made this watch perfect
4089,samsung stole the pro from apple and called their watch galaxy watch pro so apple stole the ultra and called theirs watch ultra
4090,sorry apple i will be sticking with my garmin until you can match the minimum 2 week battery life i get without battery saver
4091,doe the apple watch work with android phone
4092,great video thanks
4093,i see that lego bonsai tree in the background
4094,the battery life alone is kinda enough to think about getting
4095,they are going after the long distance endurance sport enthusiast that is why they had scott jurek a a tester it is not competitive with garmin or coros from a battery perspective but otherwise it is a much more usable watch
4096,when reviewing apple product you have to say two full day and two full night because you know apple watch do not last long when you use all the feature
4097,what an add
4098,the problem is that the battery is going to be le than 2 day after a year so is not really worth at all
4099,this mean pro watch yet to be revealed in coming year
4100,what kinda of practice you doing for 3 hour geez
4101,samsung phone s22 plus and ultra samsung galaxy watch 5 and 5 pro iphone 14 pro and pro max hence apple watch 8 8 ultra are they just trying to avoid a nomenclature clash with samsung
4102,dollar80 maybe but not dollar800 it is an apple not a cartier
4103,mkbutthd
4104,i like how it look i like the size and that it is thicker and the battery i am in
4105,lol 69percent nice
4106,apple desperately need a collab with accessory like the watch and airpods etc
4107,jeeeez that intro
4108,i did not watch the full video but i got to say something i wish for from 2018 if just apple removed the unnecessary unnecessary unnecessary apps in the watch and left the health apps and improved it and make it last for at least 2 week like the huawei watch i will be the first one to buy it ensha a allah who need to play game on a watch or using unnecessary apps just remove it for the sake of the battery i have been struggling with huawei stupid app and the new watch for what reason i do not know they removed the lock key in the new watch imagine my sister kid always play with my watch when they in my lap entering phone log calling someone or starting exercise why
4109,titaniumspecial ok thank you for your comment
4110,i never bought the dollaraapl watch cuz it wa too small
4111,excellent review and video production
4112,logic pro final cut pro
4113,why is no one like absolutely no one reviewing the latest samsung product
4114,it is like a crt monitor strapped to your wrist
4115,the compass app is updated on all watch
4116,should not wear a watch with a tux regardless of what type
4117,went to bed with 69percent battery nice
4118,great honest review thank you
4119,i shock
4120,a a non smartwatch guy i like this smartwatches are too much for me in general i will stick to my trusty ole g shock
4121,i am getting this swapping out my series 3 which is battered and actually got slightly cracked on day 3 of having it brightness is not a huge deal nor is battery but the new flat crystal will hopefully not crack while doing light work at my farm but my watch are proper abused i will admit i do not take them off for virtually anything
4122,you must be super lonely if you think this watch is not enough for sport
4123,these intro just seem to be getting better and better i would love a bts video from the studio channel
4124,wooded box at 3 min 30 is a peter mckinnon v2 pirate coin puzzle box
4125,this can not be a real dive computer i am gon na watch someone test that
4126,2 5 day of battery life and gbp900 later apple is playing you all like a bunch of schoolboy girl i am sorry i have had an iphone for most of my life but this is just getting ridiculous and silly paying gbp900 for something what only last a few day yet sell itself a the sh t for diving hiking or anything with prolonged period with no charge sound like lack of common sense to me
4127,a a triathlete i like how apple is finally starting to target u but they are missing a lot of essential feature especially compared to the competition all of the competition ha the ability to connect to 3rd party device such a power meter chest hr monitor cadence meter etc till apple add this ability it doe not do enough for me especially since all the competition ha a much better battery and give you far more advanced stats
4128,i do not t know if anyone noticed this but at 00 10 there is a subtle goddamn meme sound present
4129,you can add a case onto this watch to change that ugly color of it
4130,every year i do a portage trip in remote wilderness park ya know it is where we carry the canoe from lake to lake and i brought a dedicated gps device with 1 week of battery life it wa literally dollar600 but it would be nearly impossible to do it without it an apple watch like this would not need too many charge from my power bank and would serve me well with all of it fitness tracking waterproofness and gps stuff and the new emergency gps message system actually is a huge plus in the environment i wa considering buying a dedicated emergency so device for this very purpose but look like i will not need to any more and fyi it is way more popular than you think i can not tell you how over populated it can be even when you are 50 mile into the wilderness park like family with kid and pet are out there a lot
4131,i think the end goal with this watch wa to be able to use it while you are for the weekend away regardless the outdoor activity you will have
4132,h
4133,samsung stole the pro name for one of their product so apple using ultra now on their watch
4134,i wonder if u can melt the metal and mix with a black coloe
4135,great vid but no watch is worth dollar800 to me i get everything i need from my dollar200 smart watch
4136,anyone else find it ironic samsung phone are ultra but the watch is pro and apple phone are pro but the watch is ultra
4137,it is the best can not afford a rolex but still wan na flex watch
4138,still i am not convinced to buy smart watch
4139,looking forward to seeing 24k gold version of this watch
4140,did marque have some kind of surgery on his right hand
4141,that steering wheel is horrible
4142,thats the battery life all apple watch should have
4143,clearly never had a high end pocket knife with titanium lol it is light
4144,like all apple product they stick a premium price tag on something in the vain attempt at making it feel like a premium product trouble is it is not made like a premium product
4145,even i know the people why they do not want to buy apple watch becoz of price apple is noob btw i also got my new apple watch ultra
4146,tldr it is not a fashion watch
4147,a soon i heard sapphire i can not wait to see jerryrigeverything test it the scratch level if it true
4148,nice
4149,it is worth about dollar59 99
4150,the ultra for those who just workout and are not hitting the gps all day will get 3 4 day
4151,galaxy watch 4 pro come in black titanium chassis though
4152,i am still using apple watch 4 until now love the rugged look and feature thats what i have been waiting for
4153,this thing is huge this thing is on steroid ugh
4154,just a comment appriciating the intro here
4155,my smart watch ha 52days battery life in just a single charge and i am still laughing to see that watch which ha almost 3 day seriously who is gon na charge a watch per 3 day that is so annoying
4156,i do not think wanting reasonable battery life is an extreme use case
4157,why is this even a question
4158,when apple call out the price off 800dollar on stage is that with or without tax in the u
4159,if i am spending dollar800 on a smart watch it better have a battery way longer than 2 day i really hope hybrid screen with either e ink or layered segment display get some investment for this reason
4160,apple still do not beat the huawei watch in battery they are so far a head there p
4161,honestly if they did go the route of offering a black color while knowing it would get scratched that would be fine by me part of the attractiveness of rugged watch is the fact that you take them nearly anywhere you go and that come with battle scar it is the same idea a not restoring an old beat up mechanical seakeeper watch or something that patina tell a story and show that you do the thing in which that watch is meant to be used for
4162,the pro branding for watch would have been totally wrong the series apple watch are already pro
4163,most scuba diver want an apple watch ultra ai air integrated version
4164,i can see this being used for those who are at the beach or on float trip ect and drop their phone in the water now they if they can safely dive in the watch can help them track it just a thought
4165,what is with the scar on his hand
4166,i wa going to buy the series 8 stainless steel case but noticed the price wa same a ultra bought the ultra
4167,diamond like carbon coating the titanium would be lit tbh
4168,i wonder when apple run out of way to make the battery last longer to the point that physic said no you can not anymore will they invent the battery in the band idea that they killed off a start up a few year ago or maybe throw in a small solar panel that would trickle charge it
4169,the whole apple design esthetic seems to have blinded apple while perfectly fine for a phone or tablet arguably for a watch it is really nothing more than easily identifiable just a you would not use the basic design for a refrigerator to render a car lada and yugo excepted you really should not use it for a watch the watch wa apple is chance to show u the future again instead we have found out what they do with the leftover when they mill their other product
4170,damn i have to charge daily 7
4171,thank you marque for your well reasoned review truth is i seldom wear any watch and do not own an apple watch but being an old outdoor person and a tech geek that doe not mean i am not trying to rationalize owning the ultra
4172,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4173,a a neutral opinion i will try to give mine a clearly a i can last year i bought 13 pro i used only 1 samsung model for like 6 7 year i have used lumia and symbian before and i just wanted to see what is the deal with the apple hype 9 month later yes it is fast yes is ha fun feature which i maybe never use yes the camera is freaking awesome compared to my 7 year old samsung but thats it it is just a phone at the end of the day you will mostly use it to make call and scroll facebook i am really really big fan of normal analog watch because cmon they are awesome for some time i wa thinking of buying an apple watch but man people nowdays i got ta charge my cigarette i got ta charge my watch like cmon it is getting ridiculous also it may cost 400 eur but in my country it cost almost 900 welll let say unit i bought the 13 pro for 2600 unit and the minimum wage here is 300 eur so yeah a brand new iphone here cost 10 minimum wage and i saved so much for it so i do not think the watch will ever come in handy since the purpose of the watch is well to show the time yes i know i know nowdays it show status not the time do you know how cool analog watch you can buy for 400 eur do you really need to make call on your watch see the map text message no will people buy those thing well yes i am sure there will be people who will try to convice me how useful the watch is but cmon man your workout and swimming and climbing etc were not worse before you had your apple watch but thats just my netural opinion of person who would give it try but for that much money i can get cooler looking real watch
4174,the apple watch pro will be coming next year same shape cheaper build
4175,i hope they make an iphone ultra would love a flat display with a lip like that to make it rugged and not need an additional case
4176,so not the watch for david goggins stay hard
4177,me and the shit i can not afford a one sided love story that will never end or happen
4178,me and the shit i can not afford a one sided love story that will never end or happen
4179,let is face it the people that are out of your venn diagram will not buy an apple watch they will keep on using their suunto polar or garmin this watch battery life doe not even get close to my suunto 9 peak the functionality i miss i have them on my iphone for me this is the equivalent of the huge 7 seater suv used to drive kid to soccer or buy your coffee at the drive inn a complete overkill but people inside the venn is diagram will buy it to look cool
4180,what happened to apple and dexcom for tracking of diabetes
4181,the watch is big and mind you it look big on 6 3 marque too
4182,the watch is big and mind you it look big on 6 3 marque too
4183,it is going to be hard to top the ultra in a couple of year
4184,i will probably never do any of these activity and still get the watch
4185,im sure they are saving the pro name for a more regular sized everyday form factor with the battery and screen feature
4186,i hope this is the starting place for people to get into the watch culture and then after owning this maybe go and buy a real watch in that regard hat off to apple
4187,let is be honest here 10percent of the people who buy this watch will be actual diver or sport guy 90percent will be just guy that want to say they have the most pro version of it
4188,funny how apple and samsung swap pro and ultra now we have s22 ultra and watch 5 pro while apple have iphone 14 pro and watch ultra
4189,too much money could buy a really good famous mechanical one with that money
4190,1 mention the met gala check
4191,i want the titanium case the better battery and i love the look of the watch i do not care about the super duper fitness stuff i do not need those feature but i want the watch and have already pre ordered
4192,lol marque be like i am fine with my current watch and not gon na buy the new one next video buy the new one lol
4193,me while eating a big mac at mcdonalds oh yeah i totally need this for all the surfing climbing diving and marathonning i am about to start to do
4194,practice of what sir
4195,so expensive
4196,great thanks for the review may i ask how big your wrist is thanks
4197,i really hope the bulb on the bottom of the watch will be a thing of the past someday
4198,a just an average person who work in retail and doe not really do anything the se is all i need
4199,new drinking game idea take a shot every time mkbhd mention he went to the met gala across podcasts or video
4200,2nd year with my amazfit bip s 23percent after 22 day 30 day average battery life
4201,do you guy know if marque attended the met gala or nah
4202,welcome to byte of linux
4203,honestly when you think about people here in the u s especially in the bigger city they wear stuff a a status symbol bigger more expensive the better apple went after a subset yes but you know there will be a great portion of the population buying just bc it ha a ultra label tag to it
4204,way to big for my wrist haha
4205,from this review i now firmly believe apple ha no idea what in the shit pro mean
4206,why do not you go to church of sunday
4207,do you practice at randall is
4208,bro is a grabbing that tesla steering wheel
4209,bro i just watching u for so many year and still i did not even get a moment in the whole video to get bored i just usually skip so many part at others video because it is just do not get my attention and it is not what i wanted to hear but your video are really that worthy and amazing so keep going
4210,actually i find it pretty funny that apple call their phone pro iphone 14 pro for example and their watch ultra but samsung call their phone ultra s22 ultra and their watch pro watch5 pro
4211,any know his wrist circumference i am afraid this will look ridiculous on my 6 5 wrist
4212,2 day battery is a joke a serious athlete will always choose a garmin
4213,the apple watch is at long last ha become the real life pipboy
4214,omgggg what an intro tho even apple doe not have that quality of that introo
4215,a someone who work in construction the durability alone is a huge draw i can use an apple watch and not worry half a much ive bought it for that alone plus the battery life and fitness feature
4216,something some folk miss is that larger display mean easier for people with poor vision to read larger control mean easier to manipulate so if you are a larger older person this watch is more appealing than if you are a smaller or younger person before you even get to the other feature add being clumsy on top of it and yeah the ruggedness is nice too
4217,doe not have all the feature but while wear watch have seemingly been on hold my go to smartwatch for the last couple year ha been the power watch 2 luxe i charge it once a year amp that is it it somehow take power primarily from my body amp secondarily solar i will likely pickup the pixel watch when it is available though
4218,why can not we get the wayfinder watch face
4219,why are you not talking about the iphone 14 pro camera gate
4220,ayyy nice john mayer g shock i love mine
4221,like most thing no one need it but people will want it and those who do want it will think of reason great and small to justify to themselves purchasing it to put it another way this watch not existing wa not stopping anyone from doing what they already do
4222,okay spy kid
4223,dbrand
4224,i can not wait i ordered the ultra with the alpine band from bestbuy supposed to come oct 3
4225,this ai not tempting me away from g shock
4226,i think watch are supposed to be on the left hand just saying
4227,with those price it would be best that you give couple of your montly salary to apple than maybe you would be able to sustain their environment from iphone to appletv and now an 800dollar watch comon we were alive before all of this and were doing just fine but hey every product ha a fool that will buy it
4228,yep it is definitely an overkill for me but i am happy that they have something like this for ppl that doe those activity i think they will feel safer
4229,1 12 you got me thought my headphone i wa listening to this on were dead
4230,1 12 you got me thought my headphone i wa listening to this on were dead
4231,i always worn large watch before apple watch i have to ultras on order and can not wait for a big watch again any watch people out there
4232,apple definitely could have made more of these shell for the regular apple watch where the only feature upgrade is the bigger battery called it the apple watch max and it would sell incredibly well
4233,i have an apple watch series 6 edition 40mm and i love that it is insanely durable i have never filed a warranty claim on mine and it look great on most outfit while the apple watch ha brought new rugged minded customer they also turned away people that wanted a durable smartwatch but one that also look good for regular use the worst part is the based on my need the outgoing apple watch edition is smacked dab between the stainless steel and the famed ultra i hope they bring that back
4234,but doe it tell you the time
4235,the thing that excites me the most about this new design is it would allow for a proper glass screen protector
4236,which you do not really need seeing how it is a sapphire crystal screen
4237,compared to the samsung pro 5 it is nice the pro 5 is way too bulky
4238,smartwatches are stupid period
4239,dude your video are the best
4240,been waiting for an apple watch that fit my lifestyle and rugged wrist it is a definite buy for me
4241,not that it matter this is not for only athlete law enforcement people that work in tough condition a well
4242,would take a regular watch over any smart watch
4243,from now on every device are going to be call ultra ipod ipad iphone etc ultra
4244,why apple did not name it pro imo all pro device macbook ipad iphone are still attractive to the mass audience just not affordable or entirely useful the ultra is aesthetically displeasing and is a one size fit all watch apple doe not want the regular person to lust after the ultra it very cleanly segmented it user base with this something the other device did not
4245,just get a garmin fenix period battery life for a month store music sleep tracking the whole thing and you can get it with a solar charger
4246,marque just had to remind u he wa at the met gala good for you bruv good for you
4247,i kind of still want one but le so now i have to wait to be able to see it in person and try it one
4248,hahaha what is a pro airpods user anyway you could also dress it up with a matching titanium band like you would with a stainless band i would have liked to see a flashlight test
4249,not a good a fitbit atleast 5 day
4250,i would only consider this watch if it had a minimum of a week is battery life and 1 4 siren if true that is impressive
4251,7 day of battery in a smart watch lol you might be waiting 20 year or more the technology is not there
4252,hi
4253,think they will ever make a iphone ultra that would be amazing
4254,watching marque making that dive wa amazing
4255,even mkbhd could not resist saying nice after 69percent battery
4256,wearing the watch on the right is driving me nut lol
4257,if you pay dollar800 for an apple watch go get your iq and self control checked they are broken
4258,i have never knew frisbee is a sport what the hell lol
4259,i am convinced tim cook made that watch specifically for mkbhd to wear
4260,awesome vibe again thank you now i know more or le which one to get i think maybe they name it ultra being they may name the next iphone ultra airpod ultra and so on again thank you for another great video with great take aloha
4261,i work outside with park and recreation a a groundskeeper and pre ordered this just for the ruggedness the flat display hopefully will keep dust and particle out of the bezel gap which is the main thing that drive me crazy about the regular apple watch a screen protector also never worked on the curved display a it would bubble up and peel after a couple of week i can not wait
4262,nah it is apple all hype and overpriced
4263,what practice
4264,i will be ok without the watch amp the new iphone 14 i will be ok with my 7plus
4265,you are switching wrist
4266,is ultimate frisbee just like american football but with a frisbee
4267,hey what happened to your hand
4268,i wish the ultra is titanium case did not look like cheap aluminum and that it came in different finish
4269,pro airpods could be used for monitoring music production to ensure the quality of track to the general public because most of the people usually go for airpods and airpods pro these day there you go answered your question
4270,2000 calorie burned my 3 mile run ai not shit
4271,not even a camera for 800 dollar watch is this a joke where the world is upto
4272,even a a non apple user the watch look very impressive great feature and a lovely screen shame you can not use standard watch strap like you can with some other smart watch
4273,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4274,tbt they catered to the audience they were going for apple doe not throw itself into new market it try them out they will soon see the rest of the market start trying to migrate to it and make new band just be patient and what for earnings next quarter haha
4275,they sell lug that accommodate the pin type strap attachment
4276,tbt samsung is exactly the same
4277,also you can get a special band adapter with which you can use any old traditional watch band there are people using like 50 year old band with their apple watch
4278,someone hit it with 12 volt in some soda water and see if we get bronze
4279,i like the ultra name make it sound powerful
4280,if i were to get it it is for the battery but it is not even the best on the market so maybe not
4281,my kindergarten teacher in 1969 made u do that drawing and nobody knew why until now lol
4282,your graphic designer is getting better
4283,bro my phone cost about dollar450 and it got a snapdragon 888
4284,when did we start comparing solar powered watch to the apple watch turning into that inbox therapy idiot now are not you
4285,apply common sense before speaking listen to the video again
4286,i do triathlon and personnaly i would take a garmin all day compared to the apple watch for my activity
4287,the thing that sold me on it wa the titanium case it wa available with the series 7 for a premium price tag also this year the only non aluminum model of the series 8 wa the stainless steel case and that cost dollar750 for the 45mm model for another dollar50 i decided it wa a no brainer to get the ultra and get the added feature and the added battery life no one ha mentioned there is a stainless version series 8 and comparing that with the ultra when it come to feature and price
4288,that is a very good point
4289,this watch is all about form not function similar to a sport suv it will be bought for fashion and nothing else
4290,thats all good but titanium for watch designed to be trashed in water forrest mountain climbing etc really a long a it ha no citizen patented duratect supertitanium it will be an ugly mess of million of mikro scratch a titanium is light and hard but very scratchable very fast so it just expensive gadget for wealthy coffee drinker in town
4291,i do not think the people that are getting this are getting it for the look
4292,i do not care for the protruding side
4293,honestly marque if you were down to scuba dive and run a marathon that would be entertaining content
4294,apple watch utra or an automatic watch which have similar price
4295,it cost more than a iphone 14 itself 0 0
4296,they could not call it apple watch pro because lg got the right of the name watch pro
4297,very definition of overpriced
4298,where can i buy this gray rocket t shirt
4299,why do you switch the wrist you wear the watch i have no need for all the marathon and hiking feature but to spend dollar800 for a bigger and stronger screen with better battery life is a no go
4300,what an intro
4301,i am still processing you burning 2000 calorie from practicing sign me up
4302,my withings watch go 21 day on a single charge with heavy usage i am surprised 2 5 day is something to celebrate
4303,hi great video i want to buy the ultra apple watch but i am afraid it would look so huge on my wrist you know for a woman would it look funny
4304,my garmin fenix 6x pro ha a battery life of 21 day if i just use it a a watch if im using gps navigation it 60 hour apple is getting there somewhat but that touch screen is killing that battery cool feature but impractical for a hardcore endurance watch for someone like me who spends day in the backcountry you need the durability and battery life lot of rock and shit out there in the wild folk
4305,hey you make the faintest comment towards garmin here but show simple digital watch while doing so i feel you are doing them and your viewer a big disservice have you used one i have the fenix 6 pro from a few year ago and it ha mostly all these feature from the ultra and have done for a few year i am not knocking the ultra it is really cool just the fenix is really cool too so why do not you review them or at least make yourself informed on what other watch are in this field that are similar in price and feature to this ultra the fenix 7 ha better battery ha the dual gps ha the smart gps pinging and more it is not something i take off after a workout appreciate you talking with people who actually use these kind of watch though garmin also ha better biometric tracking than apple fwiw
4306,this watch kosts 10000 nok in norway witch is about 1000dollar
4307,you had me at the first 60 sec
4308,i am worried about the durability of the watch after a lot of use for diving the reason i would upgrade from my se
4309,definitely no waist of money
4310,anyone who rock a panerai know this is not huge
4311,too big for me for a daily and probably better option for a backpacking and bike packing watch if i wanted one also i lost my last apple watch and can not afford another a new one
4312,i really want a apple watch ultra
4313,those intro are so dope way better than apple
4314,marque brownlee question do you swap arm that you wear the watch on simply for filming or is that a thing
4315,at last an apple watch
4316,i have a theory that apple did not call it the apple watch pro because this is one of the first device aside from the macbook in which it could be taken quite literal that it is intended only for professional athlete and so i imagine an apple marketing vp piping up and saying if we call it the pro then every day people might actually not buy it let is call it the ultra so that the average non athletic person might still buy it anyway even if we market it to athlete but who know
4317,could never go from my garmin fenix 6x to this but this is definitely the most impressive apple watch yet
4318,yeeaa nahhh
4319,yup i agreed with u that i wish it come with the black color
4320,i really do not understand why they do not put a flashlight on the front
4321,doe this one being called the ultra mean apple will release a pro verson later similar design no titanium case etc thought
4322,is that a mayer g shock 5 02
4323,eeeee
4324,why do you wear it at both wrist
4325,mkbhd your intro alone are why you are my favourite tech youtuber
4326,i do not believe it will have air integration for scuba
4327,use of do not disturb help with battery you had it on during practice
4328,just leaving a comment so the boy tell me i won a prize and that i need to contact them on telegram
4329,am i interested in the apple watch nope am i here for the production quality yes yes indeed
4330,at 1 11 i honestly thought my airpods were dying i had to rewind a little to double check
4331,if u say met gala one more time wwiii
4332,i wish i waited so stoked for the sapphire screen will buy when watch 7 get old
4333,again a good neutral review did you happen to wear it during a round of golf how doe it feel compared to the tag heuer
4334,samsung galaxy watch battery time amp price r better than apple watch
4335,it is larger and brighter if your vision is not great that is a big deal
4336,what draw me to this watch is the ruggedness of it im a camp director so i do a lot of work outside that can scratch up or damage my apple watch but having a watch to take phone call no matter where i am make having an apple watch very helpful so the thought of having a tough apple watch that i will not be a worried about breaking is very appealing to me and almost enough to get my to upgrade my current apple watch
4337,i would love to see a comparison against the new garmin watch from a power user perspective
4338,the aesthetic are terrible and i can not imagine the fitment is any better especially under long sleeve or jacket too much brick even with improvement in battery
4339,can someone just make a pip boy from fallout
4340,would you release the full interview with those 3 interview you did on the podcast
4341,yes thank you for knowing it is called a crown guard a design used by manufacturer for mechanical tool watch for decade and referred to by everyone in the watch community a crown guard being very interested in the ultra i watched every video i could find doing hand on look at the ultra shortly after the announcement and in every single video i saw the crown guard wa only awkwardly described a though it wa some new concept and not one person referred to the crown guard by the it is usual name
4342,the montage 1 00 y all really outdid yourselves great work
4343,jesus you burn all calorie you eat huh
4344,like garmins suuntos show g shock come on
4345,honestly the apple watch ultra should have been the first watch apple came out with this should have been the standard
4346,when you said ultra at 6minutes i immediately thought samsung like what is up with this naming apple
4347,69percent battery nice
4348,there is no way you burnt 2000 calorie in one workout
4349,this is a pro video btw thank you for all the info
4350,really intrigued by their choice of size of this watch pretty sure they are alienating around 95percent of their user base at this size i would never buy anything that big no matter what feature it ha
4351,i think this is the video everyone wa waiting for
4352,imo i can not justify the upgrade to this thing even though i have a series 5 battery is the biggest issue for me on mine but i am not paying double for an extra day of battery they failed with that and should have offered an ultra lite version in stainless steel for 499
4353,the music at the end is too loud hard to hear his outro
4354,why do you keep swapping arm i thought it wa just different camera but the dial changed side so definitely swapping arm
4355,for me it is too thick and did not come in black so i went with series 8
4356,solid review
4357,big fan of the cherry blossom lego
4358,this is what the apple watch should have always been i have been saying that since day one who care how big it is i used to have a garmin gps watch in the late 00 is the size wa a conversation starter
4359,wait on the apple website it say 40 mt not 100 and nowhere say it is air integrated am i missing something
4360,titanium is nearly impossible to paint
4361,is definitely the most ugly looking watch from apple so far
4362,while i agree with the target audience for this new watch i do not fit it any of them i go running and walking but i am not a marathon runner but the thing that keep making me ping between garmin and apple is the battery life of the garmin the screen visibility in bright light the ruggedness and the battery life i went for a run earlier with my series 7 watch and the curved glass edge made it a nightmare to see in bright light due to the reflection plus i have scratched almost every apple watch i have ever had hoping this new one is the perfect blend for my need which is heavy on the apple integration and ecosystem but with some of the more rugged feature
4363,great video exactly a you mentioned two day of battery life is kind of bad i have had some pretty cheap huawei smartwatches for over two year now and they still last for 6 day they did 10 day when they were new i do not understand why apple can not do the same
4364,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4365,it is a lot harder when it is an oled device packed with ton and ton of feature
4366,i mean it is the o and the smart feature the way it can remotely connect play music and change apps with those fluid animation 99percent of the time doe need a heavy o than a smart band which relies on the phone for everything
4367,you know you can buy a mechanical watch that last forever but it doe not do what this watch can do and that is fine buy what you need no one care please switch your brain on
4368,whatever they used for the series 3 is amazing i am active and mine ha a few ding but no color chipping on the black
4369,there is another group of watch buyer this watch may be made for fan of swiss luxury tool watch that may be able to do a lot but for most people just look great unless the apple watch ultra is too huge for my wrist i will keep it because i can at last wear something on my wrist that look more like what i used to wear before smartwatches came along
4370,prior to the apple watch series 0 released in 2015 i wore a limited edition eli manning citizen watch it is a big watch but i never thought it to be too big for my wrist the apple ultra watch is slightly smaller and since i have owned every release of the aw always in stainless i see no reason why i would not purchase the ultra i am a middle to long distance runner the always on screen and the generally larger screen are other compelling reason this watch will be mine the increased battery life without doubt is a bonus i already get nearly 2 full day of battery life out of my current series 7
4371,i have an ipad pro but an android phone i am not going to change phone to get a watch no matter how good it is my ipad ha cellular too so there really is not any excuse why it can use apple pay card yet can not use the watch
4372,doe that mean there is a place in the line up for an iphone ultra
4373,marque like reminding u he wore an apple watch to the met gala quite a bit i think it is just a good memory for him
4374,man you could not find a better band for it that band is ugly haha
4375,what about if i am not an iphone user how will apple try to lure me to buy an apple watch instead of a garmin which work fine with both ecosystem see how trying to lock user in your own ecosystem limit the number of entry point for potential new user
4376,watch someone will put a strap on a iphone to get those size joke off
4377,you missed out ppl who are driving suv is these ppl are not going to drive into rough terrain it is more a status symbol same with the ultra watch
4378,i think because that watch is a huge leap forward compared to what pro watch would be
4379,unneccesery thing but in a pro or ultra edition just get a watch all other opinios r to justifie the apple status feeling i do not use a smartwatch cause i ve got a phone period
4380,just give u a regular or se model that can keep a battery life a long a fitbit smart watch that cost 1 2 the price lol
4381,90percent of people ive seen with watch like the garmin fenix do not gey use from them the top feture id from them that is actually useful is topo mapping but even then you have limited battery life when it come down to it most hard core adventure type wan na keep tech out of the back county experience
4382,should have called it pro
4383,sad part is that i really wanted a flat display i do not care about any of the other feaures just give me a flat glass screen like the iphones have the curved bezel make it impossible to use a screen protector my iphone 14 pro max ha flat glass my iphone 11 did not and the screen protector can go right against the edge that is all i need no curve no fat glass that is rounded off to give a depth 3d look this weighs more and is not needed apple should offer a watch 8 pro that follows the iphone pro design language
4384,you are right i truly do not understand the why behind ditching pro for ultra but hey it is apple also did the charge speed improve you did not mention or test that
4385,i really wanted to hear the siren
4386,why you did not try the crash detection i think if you try it this video will be late
4387,marque do you have a girlfriend dude
4388,nobody is going to use this for diving it doe not connect to air supply data link significan not oversight
4389,apple user be like the watch ha great battery that last 3 day and we will gladly pay you 800dollar for it meanwhile you can buy the same thing for 1 4 of the price with battery that last 2 week easy i will never get it for me this is the worst value you can get paying only for the brand it is absolutely ridiculous
4390,so at 9 00 you mention air integration associated with the oceanic app after that you mention wireless tank pressure monitoring but air integration and wireless tank pressure monitoring are the same when a dive watch is considered ai air integrated there is a wireless tank pod or transmitter that can be paired to it and some even come with the watch a a pair unless apple is able to integrate the ability to use a wireless tank transmitter to read the pressure within a scuba tank than unfortunately it will just be a standalone dive computer there are many standalone dive computer on the market already without ai but with smart and sport feature much like the garmin mk2 mk2s then a really nice stand alone dive computer such a the shearwater peregrine without smart feature it is going to be interesting to see how the apple watch performs while using the oceanic app i will be ordering it and testing it when it becomes readily available great video a always
4391,they still need to up battery having to charge every 2 day is a no go for me and even sooner if you use the function more i will stick with my garmin
4392,8 25 no i am not somebody who never owned a watch i just like the new form factor and especially the all flat display that is much better readable
4393,what really sell it to me is the larger screen
4394,0 12 the way he grabbed that steering whatever it is called made me very uncomfortable
4395,i would like to see how this new apple watch ultra look like with the old band like a fashion milanese loop so sad that the video doe not cover it
4396,please also review a garmin forerunner or enduro model to understand why ultra triathlon sporters use them a lot on the biking leg of a triathlon i really prefer to have my garmin bike computer edge 530 displaying bike gear power data heart rate cadence etc on a much bigger screen but much more important is garmin connect and the way it us all that data to give advice on training status readiness and many more data point if you want to use data to optimize your endurance activity a garmin is still the best choice for for casual endurance event finishing an ironman once to scratch it off a bucket list the apple watch ultra is sufficient
4397,but doe it work without an iphone though
4398,love the intro graphic
4399,i paid more just for titanium in the series 6 this is a no brainer for le price and way more feature including battery life which help all type of user
4400,apple need to tegiment the case like luxury watch brand sinn and damasko for a nice dark pvd color that will not scratch dollardollardollardollardollardollar
4401,awful trend with those oversensitive microphone mouth unsticking inhales licking lip etc sound disgusting
4402,i wish there wa an hermes variant id buy that for now i will stick to the normal hermes one
4403,i am a standard guy no ultra sport here but i like big watch and increased battery life is enough for me to go with ultra on top of that why i should pay the same for series 8 cellular when ultra cost the same with ton of feature more doubled battery life
4404,great video love it what is with the scar
4405,doe anyone know if these apple watch is can be set to vibrate say after every 20 length in a swimming pool like the garmin doe thanks
4406,i really wish apple would spend time doing a better sleep tracking fitbit destroys apple in this regard also having the compas on the regular apple watch would be awesome
4407,waiting for galaxy watch 5
4408,come to seattle marque and i will take you climbing rock ice you name it
4409,could apple possibly be saving the pro name for the non extreme athlete user i would still love a sapphire glass better battery brighter screen but do not need much else from the ultra
4410,can we talk about that absolute raptor claw grip on the tesla yoke
4411,yeah i think there are a lot more fringe segment that this watch is applicable to case in point my job is up to 80percent travel and i can be sent anywhere in the world the waypoint backtrack and emergency satellite feature alone are worth the price of admission for me a a hail mary in the event that something go sideways fast
4412,my opinion for the weekend warrior the apple watch ultra is a good fit but serious athlete will mostly stick with a garmin watch or coros etc they maybe big and chunky but it the functionality and accuracy that matter not the style
4413,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4414,apple need to update the design of their watch at the very least give it flat edge and place the crown in the middle where it belongs a round version of the watch would also be most welcome i get a feeling apple is just desperately trying to be different even though the end result look like an embarrassing kid toy
4415,man i want want want one of these
4416,this is one of the very few time i will say that apple actually made a decent product but a always given how overpriced it is like with every of their product it make it irrelevant unless you do not value your money appropriately
4417,could you please review galaxy watch 5 pro too
4418,i mean there is clearly a naming scheme that match the industry m1 m1 pro m1 max m1 ultra amd ryzen 3 5 7 9 intel i3 i5 i7 i9 phone and watch following suit is a nice touch in my opinion help unify the level of branded product
4419,me a person that is laying down on the couch watching youtube while eating a cheeseburger the apple watch ultra wa made for me
4420,pro mean more money and high end tech or else the pro feature would not trickle down to the normal version
4421,it look bad
4422,imo this watch is trying to capture more of the men is watch market the design is catered to the men is market i know many men and i am one who still do not wear a smart watch because of concern about durability battery life size and feature my watch for backpacking climbing etc is a casio pro trek like the one you showed with an altimeter compass and solar charging my daily watch is a seiko solar chronometer both never need charging are rated water resistant to 100m static pressure and tell me what i need to know both are about 1 3 the price of this and are much higher performing in the way that matter to me
4423,it will come in black next year trust me
4424,the apple watch ultra is on my radar simply because of it battery life brightness and action button assignment i would highly prefer a black version of this for reason stated in the video
4425,in germany we pay 200dollar more than in the u why is that tax is it not maybe inflation or maybe because apple is a u brand
4426,a a skateboarder i do not need a watch
4427,for me this is pretty huge
4428,do you think this watch will be good for contractor or like trade worker
4429,the only thing i worry about is the watch slowing down after a few year like most apple product do i have a series 3 watch and it is ridiculously slow now dollar800 is a lot of money for something that will only last for a few year
4430,dumb question do you use an nd filter for your outdoor shot
4431,hey marque if you do not think the ultra is for you could you send me it please and thanks lol
4432,that claw hand on the tesla steering yoke tho
4433,calorie tracking can not be accurate marque burnt 2 3 of a lb of fat in 3 hour
4434,using the airpods low battery sound in the intro threw me for a loop lmao
4435,please please marque help u talk to google because your voice is heard we suffer a lot in the middle east with a lot of indian video we are looking for video in english and we get many result for video with english title but their audio content is indian please please we want a solution to this issue we want google to filter video based on audio we suffer a lot

4439,00 10 haha
4440,in 6 month and 3 update the watch will do 5 hour battery and get hot just in time for the next dollar900 version next year
4441,appreciate your thought on this i think i will stick to my original but this is pretty cool
4442,what is this frisbee workout that marque is using and how do i get it i track all of my ultimate frisbee practice a outdoor walk lol
4443,wait for the matte black version from colorware for mkbhd
4444,watch are meant to be worn on the left hand
4445,i find charging my watch while driving a good way of not missing anything important and always having my watch charged
4446,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4447,relax bro iwatch pro coming soon with price tag dollar1500 suck it
4448,this is a great watch for u military folk on and off the grid i will test this against my trusted garmin fenix 6 it is not a big watch if you are use to wearing big watch no different then having the max pro phone
4449,i am absolutely the audience for this i am a qualified diver recreational and technical a fairly regular hiker mountain biker multi day wilderness trekker and a regular runner gym goer prior to this the only realistic option for people like me to have an all in one device wa the garmin descent mkii google the price though and look at how dated it already look and you might see why i have not made the leap just yet from my current combination of garmin fenix 6 and a basic mare recreational dive computer in reality most of my dive are usually single cylinder recreational dive and this is the case for most tech diver i have come across for a number of reason that go well beyond this post this aw is therefore a really tempting option for me a for anything technical i have two separate computer anyway the one other major hassle this would solve would be the constant changing between watch on the boat before after kitting up taking kit off pre and post dive it doe not sound like a big problem but dive boat are busy place with heavy equipment knocking around so every time i take my fenix off i always have to worry about it being either lost or broken not an issue if you never have to change watch in the first place regarding trekking i wa worried about the battery life initially but in reality i only get about three or four day of battery including tracking storm alert etc from my garmin when outdoors anyway despite the amazing standby of around 2 week i and most trekker i meet these day tend to a carry battery pack s anyway so the battery life is not really a huge problem with the performance that marque is seeing all in all i am seriously considering this a my first apple watch a day i thought would never come
4450,not worth this overhyped shit
4451,i really do not get why it is still getting compared with garmin my 955 almost half the price last more than 10 day with 6 of them being active around 13 15 hour in total of gps on the super extra gps setting and sleep tracking it ha an amount of sport that i would not do in my entire life ha some insane algorithm and training data and it is so light i do not even feel i am wearing it i get that it is a cool product for apple but in my opinion it is just incomparable with garmin i mean garmin ha some watch that their battery would last almost forever with that being said you are a legend mate keep up the awesome work
4452,my garmin mk2i is 52mm massive compared to the apple watch ultra
4453,i would have bought this watch if it came in black so i got disappointed when it wa announced
4454,i can not stand sewing all this tech garbage in my suggested video
4455,almost 1 million view in just 5 hour well know rapper struggle to get that much in day
4456,the graphic are actually sick
4457,up to this date i still have my apple watch series 3 since it is the one gen that started cellular data on it also i can swim with it and such now can someone explain if it is worth upgrading my apple watch to this what are the new feature on this thing
4458,i got a series 8 45mm and it still seems small compared to what i usually wear make me realize just how chunky my other watch are
4459,nah those apple watch clip showing the face with the effect on the outside wa crazy apple could have used that for their ad holy
4460,man hope you wash and let it dry lol
4461,i feel like this look like a cartier santos tank with a metal link band i feel it would be almost a elegant and way more useful
4462,im sorry this watch is way to over price
4463,samsung call their high end phone ultra amp apple call their smartwatch ultra apple call their phone pro amp samsung call their watch pro can this be coincidental
4464,so do you want the iphone 14 or the apple watch ultra
4465,i think apple will be releasing a middle ground apple watch that will be called pro and that is why this one is the ultra
4466,no wat h should not be nomore than damn dollar150 800 for a watch is just ridiculous to me
4467,ooooo i spy a melgeek mojo68 plastic
4468,i feel like you review apple watch in a vaccum garmin dominates the sport watch market after watching this they are still going to
4469,portland jamiaca in the building
4470,sadly work only on apple product so basically you have to get into apple
4471,is the compass dial only available on the ultra
4472,watch aside the grip you have on the tesla is ridiculous what a stupid wheel design lmao
4473,samsung should sue apple taking the name ultra and putting it on the new watch
4474,good video
4475,nah
4476,9 19 these people are going off and carving there own path for mile and mile show footage of him walking right outside his office
4477,i am glad you mentioned suunto i used to have one in the military i absolutely loved it this really doe remind me of the core which how rugged it look
4478,that action button could potentially prevent public kidnapping the siren is loud enough to attract attention a well a the waypoints this in some scenario could save your life day to day regardless of whether your a athlete or not worth it maybe but still pretty useful
4479,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4480,totally worth it it is under priced
4481,this watch ha an absolutely enormous pull for the filthy stinking rich
4482,technical diver here the apple watch ultra will hopefully introduce million of people to scuba diving and on paper seems to be a good dive computer for new and those who dive very infrequently but although it seems like this could be a good option for serious hiker and triathletes etc it is definitely not the case for serious diver we are eagerly waiting for our unit to test them and provide an unbiased review from the diver perspective because again on paper the scuba diving capability of this watch fall short from even the most basic dive computer on the market stay tuned
4483,eww oppp if u do not have a dive computer and you dive to deep depth you are probably going to die
4484,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4485,the whole thing is just another apple gimmick the 99percent of people who will buy this are buying it for the battery life and because it is something new from apple they could have just upgraded the standard apple watch with the feature that 99percent of people buying this want
4486,agreed can not wait to see your review imho this seems to be great for the once a year every few month diver or people that are completely brand new to scuba diving a a whole i think this will probably compete most directly with suunto is d4i novo zoop novo amp d5 or garmin is descent g1 for me garmin is descent mk2i dive computer is honestly the most compelling device for me a a tech diver more so than the shearwater perdix though i know i am in the minority when i say i am not a fan of shearwater is comp lol
4487,i think they are aiming more for the once every few month diver not the once a week technical cave diver with 40k worth of gear
4488,is it only me who wear watch in left hand
4489,great video please ask them to make watch to be worn on right hand with reverse dial and button so it is easy for u lefty to use the crown and butting etc
4490,i feel that the battery life is not enough i have a garmin fenix 7 and it last me a week without charging such a great experience
4491,crap battery life compared to coros garmin other fitness watch
4492,crown side in is the best way to use nice
4493,i hope i will check this watch anyway garmin 7x pro probably is better for me
4494,a an ultra runner and fan of apple product i have to say this watch doe not deliver what i find in a garmin or similar watch it would be a long list to compile my thought but two stick out the still lacking battery life not for one activity but over a full week of training and the lack of button there is so much muscle memory built into the way i use my garmin on the garmin i can go blindly to a specific data point while running i can not on a touch display or with the crown i still see this watch a a lifestyle item edit even more importantly this apple watch lack any recovery metric which is a major factor for judging training
4495,iphone mini a well catered to a very small fraction but it discontinued only after 2 version so what do you think of the watch ultra now
4496,people spend 10 100x more on non smart watch so thats how i justify buying the ultra
4497,daaaamn all the little detail are so on point you guy make such good video congratulation for your work it is a pleasure to watch every video
4498,quite a comprehensive review of the new apple watch ultra i am interested in purchasing it due to the enhanced battery life and ruggedized construction i do hope that apple doe not upgrade the apple watch ultra every year a they do with the standard apple watch
4499,the fact that the 6 to the 7 to the 8 basic were marginal improvement with price jump and now a pro with a real improvement make 3 got ta have watch because timmy is popping a chubbie and dancing so the fanbois can pop an empathetic chubb is pathetic this one might be worth dollar800 but if you were stupid enough to upgrade every year from the 5 to this you got way too many dollar and clearly no sense
4500,a i am someone who doe a lot of spartan savage and other type of ocr race this is a good thing my series 6 dy quick on the trail and is deemed useless after mile 5
4501,i basically live on a ranch i have beaten my apple watch up over the last few year and a more durable one is great
4502,watch ultra is actually cheaper than a normal titanium variant of a cellular series 7 if i am not wrong and that is the most surprising probably non apple thing apple did
4503,i do not need the ultra at all i have had the series 3 4 amp 6 all in stainless steel i am going to upgrade my series 6 to the ultra mainly because the series 8 is not much different to the 6 the cost difference is not a lot and i want a different design i will never use the diving hiking or mountain feature but doe that mean this watch is not for me i do not like how sometimes apple seems to suggest just because you will not use the feature the watch wa designed for that you should just get the se i want a bigger brighter screen i want a better battery same thing with the macbooks i am not a pro at all in any sense but i still prefer the macbook pro over the air and i usually want the 16inch pro just for the display quality and battery size my point is i always feel like i should not be buying these product or feel guilty for buying them just because they are not designed for my life case great video a always
4504,1 02 i want to thank the person who did that beautiful absolutely stunning clean work
4505,in belguim is that euros1000
4506,about time for the ultra review and it doe look so big like a brick strapped on the wrist
4507,well you are paid not to say nah
4508,i dunno man that thing look huge on you and a you pointed out it is a block sitting on your wrist
4509,maybe this will produce some fun dive metric but i would never trust a consumer smartwatch for anything safety related
4510,apple watch paint still suck it is not that rugged i will be surprised if it doe not start peeling off this watch
4511,it start at 1000euros in europe
4512,this watch is not simply for those who need the extra feature it for anyone and everyone who want to rock the most expansive iwatch there is which is a much bigger group than those who will actually use it crazy feature it like seeing those off road capable land rover able to go up steep incline wade through high water and climb over rock and through thick mud but are really only used to drop the kid off at school and go mall shopping
4513,man just keep getting better and better
4514,oh the vfx
4515,pro airpods is someone using their pod for telemarketing etc a person who is profession requires they be taking call a lot of listening ignorance is real with you so stupid you have convinced yourself you are smart
4516,for 800 dollar the watch better have a god damn 007 laser capable of cutting the floor out of a train
4517,it is simply the suv of watch do not need it but you want it being a poser is ok right they will sell alright
4518,you do not wear a watch on your right marque sorry buddy
4519,this bro will look like james bond with this apple watch and the tux
4520,know the time without seeing you have 1 249 unanswered email timex
4521,do extreme dive sport and test it it would be fun video watch
4522,this thing is like dollar1050 if you take our uk pricing and covert it it is definitely put me right off i would be interested if the conversion wa better
4523,love the graphic on the intro very very slick great work
4524,appreciate you and your channel and content blessed to have you everyday
4525,why do not they curve the underside of the watch kind of easy to do if you have several size and add a huge amount of comfort and battery space
4526,it is titanium ha a sapphire crystal display and an extra programmable button enough get on my wrist
4527,seeing how your crew work with your skin color during different point of exposure let me know these other company are not trying on purpose
4528,ok you are intro have always been awesome but this wa on another level
4529,the nice on 69percent of battery got me
4530,i have a collection of animal skull in my backyard from off trailing for mile and mile i should get this
4531,anyone feel lazy after hearing about mkb and his early morning workout
4532,i really love your t shirt
4533,i work in the military so this watch those everything i wanted to do great to wear it for our hike and morning pt is
4534,i just use a mechanical watch and never have to worry about battery
4535,to be honest i think this watch is the new and most accurate accessory which scream douche bag alert
4536,yes
4537,it is cool but 25 day charge of garmin tactix 7 pro with all the built in feature is something else
4538,i wish it had a battery for like 4 5 day just to keep up with other fitness tracker
4539,i got convinced to buy a casio pro trek
4540,why 69
4541,nice lol
4542,i know that garmin watch have 6 7 day of battery power so this pro watch is nothing special
4543,that is a watch to own
4544,pro is similar to youtuber doing professional review pro is completely irrelevant
4545,watch doe not look good on you wrist is to small skinny
4546,i am one of those outsider nothing against apple actually lot but that is not the kicker for me i just think they are ugly especially this ultra version i have had calculator watch tv remote watch g shock but this is ugly look cheap i just do not like the look of apple watch
4547,all apple store in manhattan open at 9am at what time of september 23rd should i go to store and think about getting this will there be in store stock or only go to 5th avenue coz it 24 7 store
4548,garmin are pooping their pant
4549,only the ogs would know that song in the intro
4550,shout out to the studio team because that intro wa absolutely insane
4551,very thorough review literally everything i wanted to know about the watch
4552,for 800dollar this damn thing should last 8 day
4553,i still can not get over the fact you wear your watch on your right wrist
4554,nice
4555,how doe it feel on the wrist when you sleep
4556,and this watch is incredibly dumb u guy are like a dumb cult because the watch is flat af can not it be a bit curved to fit the wrist better apple u are idiot
4557,funny how apple get ultra from samsung they can not get there own name lol
4558,i have skinny wrist what size are yours i am scared this thing is going to look like a can noteen on me
4559,i love that it bigger and bulky i hope apple keep this style moving forward for their ultra watch leave the sleek and slim watch for the standard line
4560,800dollar for a watch ai not buying it
4561,do you change which arm your wearing the watch
4562,can not be glitch from reboot
4563,nah my old garmin feinx work great and the 7 year old watch run for a week on a charge with multiple activity if i were to get a new one it would be another garmin that ha solar and can run for a month and yeah i do a lot of outdoor thing
4564,oh and he should review the newest garmin watch in comparison there is really no comparison but hey fanbois gunna fanboi
4565,will the price go down over time before the next upgrade model get released in the market
4566,is nobody going to talk about that catch from marque
4567,a a scuba instructor i really want this watch the price is doable if i see it a a watch and a simple dive computer in one my current dive computer mare icon hd with transmitter wa way more expensive and can only be used for diving sure it ha way more diving feature but for 80percent of my dive overkill the apple watch ultra is indeed compact in comparison
4568,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4569,800 dollar for a watch btw thats the same price a the phone
4570,i am curious to get this one a well i have a series 4 the battery ha degraded down to 75percent and sometimes deloads it charge overnight i like the orange accent and the size of the watch and some of the watch face infographics i am not that active but the price of the ultra is barely more than a stainless steel watch which people get all the time otherwise they would not even offer it to me it is not that absurdly expensive for a watch that last 4 year or more
4571,do you need an iphone to make it work or can you use it with an ipad our like someone else is friend parent iphone hmm weird question but i am not sure i am able to choose between this an samsung watch or an withings watch a someone looking for long battery life sleep and heartrate tracking
4572,it is dollar1100 and that just make it really hard to recommend to anyone
4573,how come this guy can kill every intro of product
4574,a a scuba diver i definitely want to try this watch out i do not know how in depth the ocean app will be but the ability to upload your dive info straight to your phone or macbook look pretty nice i will let you know mkbhd how it doe 40ft down below
4575,i ordered it because i want it
4576,slap a d brand skin on it
4577,apple is lame i hate the phone app how easy it is to hang up on people if u wan na leave the app to open another app they are so dumb they suck
4578,my issue with apple watch series 7 cellular is battery life if you do not want to bring your phone somewhere for a few hour and you are taking call streaming music etc i am not always getting to the end of the day on a single charge and i think releasing yourself from your phone and only using the watch on cellular is the huge selling point of even having the watch
4579,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4580,i mostly only upgraded because of the battery after a year of battery degradation the battery on the apple watch wa already getting too close by the end of the day and the apple watch is not a device i will be upgrading every year more like every 3 or 4 year so the le often i need to pay to have the battery replaced the better with how i use the current apple watch i wa annoyed with having to recharge it in the same day for it to comfortably last before i went to bed which left no room for sleep tracking or just made doing so an inconvenience i like the idea that i will probably only have to charge the ultra while i am showering to ensure it never dy
4581,the box in the background because the watch ultra is boxy
4582,trading in my series 5 gold stainless for a series 8 gold stainless and also getting the ultra series 8 will be my dress up watch and the ultra i will wear pretty much all the time not into the extreme activity shown for the watch i just like the aesthetic longer battery life brightness and ruggedness i think there are more people like me out there than apple think there are who will get this watch
4583,i want one of these just for the battery life there have been time when i have had to take the series 6 off and put it on the charger a couple hour before bed far earlier than i normally would just because i happened to work out for an extra hour or so that day i do not even use it for sleep tracking i wear it from about 8am to about midnight do a 2 3 hour workout in there somewhere if i am not being lazy and it is usually down to around 10 15percent by the end of the day i also avoid using the cellular feature or even having it away from my phone ever to avoid the cellular antenna turning on
4584,apple the apple watch ultra still is not enough for me come get me
4585,is it just me or doe he keep switching wrist
4586,how many mm is his wrist
4587,man that battery life is sounding almost like a garmin
4588,throughout the video i wa focused on you wearing your watch on your right wrist
4589,i stick to normal watch
4590,no offline download you trippin
4591,the price alone is not the problem sustainability is the real challenge of smartwatches they are technically obsolete after 2 4 year whereas a well made mechanical watch remains stable in value for decade
4592,that intro for the watch clean
4593,maybe in future they will make a ultra iphone mkbhd it sound like that phone will be harder to brake i wish they make iphone ultra one some day and that can go 100 meter deep sapphire display it will be cool
4594,honestly you are the only channel that ha these absolutely brilliant intro keep up the good work
4595,i am so excited they sell the band for this watch separately it say it the small text it is compatible with the 44 45 mm size
4596,where can we watch your gameplay
4597,a an amature runner and hiker the garmin is battery is crucial and everything lasting a day and a half like the previous watch is a no go with everything in the apple ecosystem an apple smartwatch is a huge attraction my one gripe and the reason i will not buy it right now it is a rectangle
4598,no way bro for a diver whatch the m nimum oh depht is 200m 100m is just for fun or shallow water activity
4599,what did you do with the extra frog
4600,my 5 6 year old samsung gear s3 frontier is black and none of the color is peeled and i still after all this time get two day plus of battery life original battery imagine that
4601,entertaining video but it ha a daily runner i will be sticking with my garmin i run daily for an hour and never take my garmin off at 7 day i still have a 30 to 40 percent charge remaining great job apple just not there yet for me
4602,i agree garmin need to up their game to stay ahead though
4603,i think another category of the apple watch ultra are the dreamer apple say they help dreamer become do er and i truly feel this watch might inspire some people to want to be the extreme adventurist but have maybe not felt confident without the proper tool it is very similar to way some people by a macbook pro because they want to become a developer or editor but need the proper stepping stone to get them in that direction amazing stuff
4604,pfff a a developer who currently owns a macbook if you can not start studying to become a dev without a mac the mac will not change that
4605,it is a very cool watch but i do not need it i wear a series 7 it is perfect for my need
4606,holy smoke the production quality the audio intro is so good and optimized i have dolby atmos speaker and the right left audio switch wa soo cool
4607,i have a letsfit iw2 smartwatch it cost me 40 freedom unit shipped to my door doe everything a basic smartwatch need to do along with some custom display an app for android that work well the company is based out of fla i have had people who do not know ask if it is an apple watch and best of all the dang thing last nearly 10 day on a charge apple want 800 freedom unit for their watch and for what i need in a watch hell no
4608,0 44 it july 29th i take my watch off the charger and go about my daily business for a few day on august 14th i go out on the mississippi river i do a bit of swimming but overall a lazy day on august 19th i decide to walk a marathon in my house while watching old sci fi show like firefly stargate sg1 the original star trek i only make it 13 mile before my ankle start to hurt for some reason maybe i should have work shoe but it always feel uncomfortable to walk long distance in shoe for me on september 3rd i hide in wait inside some bush with my sony a7iii and a6400 both with 600mm lens a i wait to take picture of my cousin a he proposes to his girlfriend on their morning walk along the river front from almost a block away the only good vantage point that woudnt have put me in an obvious spot close to them it is now september 21st and i have decided i should probably charge my watch in the next week or two because it is getting down to 10percent i should probably check the sleep tracking heart rate and blood oxygen stats at some point
4609,of note i didnt go to lake norfork arkansas this year so i didnt get a chance to take my watch diving also i miss my old cassio riserman gw9200 1 i have never had to charge that old solar monster after something like 12 year
4610,this video is amazing a year ago i thought to myself these guy can not get any better this video proved me wrong great job fantastic editing
4611,it is a watch for show offs and apple is again testing how much a consumer is willing to pay for their product
4612,marque found the omnitrix
4613,i am not into all that adventure b but give me a rugged iwatch that will survive the urban jungle the ultra delivers and with the cellular feature i am good to go i will be getting it
4614,my goodness i listen to this song thinking of your old video and thought you would not use it again but there you are proving me wrong xd
4615,this is the ugliest watch i have ever seen apple is changing
4616,my g shock dw5600 is still the best watch
4617,the wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest different stream of income that doe not depend on the govt especially with the current economic crisis around the world this is a good time to invest gold silver and digital currency btc eth
4618,investing in crypto now should be in every wise individual list in some month time you will be ecstatic with the decision you made today
4619,nice
4620,that animation tho it wa fireee
4621,look great but i think im gon na keep my series 7 for awhile my series 2 lasted like 6 year till the battery started dying quickly
4622,i honestly have to say that i am excited for mine to come on friday even though i am not an extreme outdoors athlete or trainer i do go walking hiking almost every day and find that the improved battery life of the ultra with it extended battery life mode coming later this year to be enough of a reason to upgrade also a marque put it this is basically a pro model that offer feature that more avid hardcore user of the apple watch can appreciate all of the new upgraded hardware feature of too bad that there is not a slightly better processor than the series 8 or se 2 built in but hey for the first time ever in the apple watch is 7 year history this edition actually ha more going for it for the price than just the outer casing which when compared to the series 7 edition is that much more of a bargain for the price i will be doing my own first impression unboxing when i get mine friday but i already know that barring some major unforeseen flaw or regret i plan to keep this until at least next year when we see if how apple evolves this new line of apple watch
4623,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4624,you spent 800 dollar on a watch how stupid
4625,bro my garmin forerunner need charging once every week and a half i train with it walk with it 24 7 and sleep with it on
4626,huawei is on another level for dollar500 i have a fully titanium watch and strap sapphire face with 14 day of battery life or 8 day of heavy use with all the same sensor workout tracking sleep tracking etc and it look classy or go with the older version for dollar200 and get the same thing with just slightly worse interface
4627,nice dive in that ultimate clip
4628,mkbhd be putting out video at an alarming rate that is a good problem to have
4629,the stick people diagram wa more impressive than any motion graphic i have ever seen on this channel more
4630,i am grabbing it for the battery screen size and ruggedness i love my apple watch and it is been to hell and back with me and is pretty worse for the wear because of it here is hoping the ultra hold up much better
4631,a a climber and general mountain athlete this is very compelling watch but sadly far too expensive
4632,we somehow need a dbrand skin for the ultra please make it happen
4633,mine get delivered friday this vid just spiked my anticipation
4634,now what they need for the diver and hiker and this would be awesome is some sound that can drive away shark bear mountain lion etc
4635,i wonder how apple doe the water rating with a regular quartz or mechanical watch that is good up to 100m doe not actually mean your can go down 100m 100m is usually good for like surface swimming or a few foot down
4636,which size band did you get
4637,i own dozen of luxury and bespoke watch my second aluminum apple watch died on me after a day of paddle boarding and salt water fishing took to apple store and they were unable to repair it looked at the stainless steel a a replacement decided for dollar200 more why not the ultra let is me try scuba with my buddy take on camping trip wear during gardening without fear and most importantly to me it look great and is cheaper than similarly featured garmins etc with the apple ecosystem lastly not having to charge it before going to sleep remove a major pita from previous edition
4638,it is actually not cheaper than comparable watch in europe the ultra will be euros999 only garmin is top high end product belong above that price in the cheaper category ultra comparable watch like the entire fenix 6 and most of the fenix 7 series all forerunner 945 and 955 model the epix and the tactix make it hard for the ultra to compete and let is just for fun say we agree that those watch target much the same people then at le than half the price of an ultra you will get some garmin fr 955 fenix 6 pro instinct 2 approach venu 2 plus or fr 945 lte the trade off that remains with garmin is no apple ecosystem although personally i see that a a benefit the trade off that remains with apple watch ultra is forget about connecting ant device any cycling power meter or broadcasting heart rate to a significan not portion of the crowd apple is targeting with the ultra these are must have is
4639,not worth it never gon na pay 800 for a watch
4640,a a ff emt i have been waiting for a watch that would last a 48 hour shift i do not like taking my watch off on shift and i would like to track how much sleep i get and how active i am also the durability of standard apple watch is a little worrisome for me i bang my watch on any and everything most 3 party case are not comfortable so i have to sacrifice comfort for durability or vise versa
4641,i want dollar300 dollar400 apple watch that ha a week long battery life i currently use a cheap dollar50 smart watch which get two week of battery life so i do not think it is too much to ask for lol
4642,can you please make a video about what it mean to be a pro and what apple mean by this thank you so much
4643,just curious you are right handed why do not you have the watch on the left maybe also why you keep pressing the button
4644,it is like a tag a criminal wear but for corporation to steal data stick to mechanical watch people
4645,overpriced
4646,no it is not worth it
4647,apple exec how do we get people to pay two to three time the cost of an apple watch just for dollar5 worth of titanium designer hold my la croix mind you they have sold titanium apple watch for dollar899 since at least series 5 but they were not exactly flying off the shelf this is greed through and through the ultra is 50percent thicker than the regular apple watch whereas previous series had similar dimension between steel aluminum and titanium
4648,it is an expensive woman repeller if it were not and looked anywhere presentable at a dinner or a party it would be worth it just for the extra battery it would just last longer and pay for itself they should have still kept the regular titanium option for people who wanted sapphire glass but not the weight of steel and were still into getting as
4649,talk fact bro the price is not worth it save some more n buy jordan is gucci nike fossil etc
4650,one wear a watch on one is left hand young man
4651,i love your intro
4652,it is not an mkbhd video if he doe not mention wearing an apple watch to the met gala
4653,marque 69percent battery nice
4654,finally this is what i wa waiting for the lego bonsai tree
4655,good honest review feel like the sensible me ha just said nope you do not need it so i will live in hope of some low power apple fitness band with 5 day battery the market is there apple you just need to get to and get it
4656,i will wait for next year ultra watch
4657,samsung named theirs pro so apple hit them with ultra
4658,when it come in black i will probably get it great review
4659,i appreciate the stereo effect on your opening musical intro very cool
4660,i saw marque is sharing the comment on instagram so here is mine
4661,it is morphing time 1 26
4662,bro forgot that watch came before smartwatches and start explaining how it didnt need to be charged
4663,a a human i can say i want this watch only cause it look like a man is watch everything else is a bonus
4664,marque is your wrist about 18cm 180mm
4665,i always forget that you are an ultimate frisbee player that is a crazy range of skill you have
4666,hey marque whats your wrist diameter also i think you missed a class of people those who want something different looking to an apple watch
4667,samsung quick let is call our watch the galaxy watch 5 pro before apple us the pro apple two can play that game introducing the apple watch ultra
4668,a long a apple doe not make a circular watch it is not for me
4669,missing critical feature unlike the phone where apple borrowed from huawei they neglected to borrow the built in blood pressure device no external item needed just the watch
4670,it look really good on you not to big
4671,it not about getting a few hardcore people hooked into the ecosystem it about making standard people feel like adventurer when they spend just a little more then the regular watch once again a great marketing move from apple
4672,hell nah
4673,that crown guard make me wonder how it will do with dirt and grime i can imagine feeling the grind and hearing the crunch or get stuck who know
4674,i really wish they would let people use apple watch with an ipad i will not ditch my android but my ipad is here full of potential and being used for ambient rain sound because apple would rather you not use you ipad for anything useful
4675,like always a free apple commercial video the first time mkbhd say something negative about apple stuff like he always doe with non apple product i will eat my shoe
4676,apple hasnt thought of another group of user like me cheapskate i use a dollar50 smartwatch with battery that last more than a month amazfit bip
4677,i would get it if it came in black
4678,so according to apple that all the one outside of your illustration circle are all male you are lucky you are a male this watch really suck for small boned small wristed female i would like to take a watch on an extended hike not unite a pct or other through hike but segment when i can afford the time to go so a a woman i have to settle for a gps watch that doe not have the accuracy and the battery life apple really need to hire more woman in product design curtis machale talk about this in one of his video on a book review about how item are mostly designed for men and that woman just have to be subjected to crap like this even those other watch you have shown i have seen model for woman
4679,fun fact i have casio watch that my brother got for his 7th birthday he is now 22 year old and the watch is still running on the same battery it came with
4680,just buy a black case i will probably not use most of the feature actually i m getting it because i been waiting for a bigger apple watch
4681,hey animator you are killing it
4682,it will sell well in the usa where everything is judged concerning what is best v good enough a toyota is good enough over a lexus they both perform the same thing transportation
4683,shout out to trex pro 2
4684,waiting for the pixel watch reveal early next month but this wa very cool
4685,just wear a garmin or amazfit t rex 2 this is overrated for the price point
4686,luckily i have small wrist so there will not be any temptation
4687,can not wait for some skin or bumper protector to add some color to that peace of metal
4688,are you holding the steering wheel like that just to show the watch off or do you drive like that
4689,goddamn
4690,nahhhhhhhh no smartwatch regardless of brand oe feature is worth more than dollar150 lol
4691,with watch reaching this size i feel the need for a small curve on the screen to minimise the block on the wrist look of something this large
4692,awesome watch but a a runner i rather stick to my garmin that i only need to charge twice a month i never take it off
4693,loved the review hate seeing anyone wearing watch on their right arm i would imagine that is why you keep hitting the action button
4694,i love mkbhd review of phone and such but not sure if he ha enough experience to compare this apple ultra watch with it is competitor like garmin coros suunto or polar
4695,get a garmin watch it gps is awsome it is way way better than apple at golf with not a nice a display
4696,amazfit gtr2 7 day battery
4697,what size watch band do you wear
4698,it is a huge waste apple watch depreciate in value luxury watch appreciate in value do not buy an apple watch unless you are a sheep consumer
4699,i feel like i am at a rave party with the music in the beginning
4700,just want to know what size band work for you the one in the vid
4701,apple is taking the piss
4702,the iphone 14 start at the same price a this watch if you can not do everything on the watch that you can do on the phone then it definitely not worth it no thanks
4703,not worth it i have a casio explorer style watch that charge from the sun and update itself off of satellite half the price and never need to be charged by a computer port
4704,finally someone that us 20syl track in a video
4705,that tesla steering wheel is so awkward lol
4706,i think it is overpriced
4707,jesus christ is coming soon believe in him jesus christ is the only way to heaven llllll
4708,meanwhile my garmin last me 10 day
4709,better than rolex for sure
4710,when is marque getting married
4711,pebble is better
4712,suggestion for a merch with but written on it
4713,i swear mkbhd ha been stealing apple is production team with how good the lighting and graphic are
4714,i bought the huawei gt3 pro and it million time way worth than this crap even cheaper
4715,hello marque are you gon na do the new fitbit watch review
4716,the motion graphic in that intro were so clean
4717,i am an android guy but this watch is beautiful
4718,coming from someone who played ultimate in college but knew you first a a youtuber i appreciate the little highlight bid play for a score and the review equally shoutout to suny cortland men is ultimate but we went by team rocket
4719,where is the link to the podcast
4720,garmin watch battery last a week
4721,very well said about the watch presentation on skinny hand or wrist it is really looking bumpy wearing it apple shd hv done something not to look bumpy on wrist
4722,everyone in the comment just creating valid reason why they need the watch just buy it ffs it is your money there is no need to rationalize
4723,i have a velcro loop on my apple watch series 4 it doe not sound like i would be able to get that for this particular apple watch correct me if i am wrong
4724,i have no idea why i am watching this lol literally would not even use the watch se but i guess that prof how good your video are
4725,i do not do any of the advertise usage for this watch yet i still bought one because i personally like the new flat screen look and the bigger battery is also a plus for me
4726,amiddle of nowhere
4727,i have a garmin venu 2 with heavy usage it last 4 day very happy with my purchase it is very powerful never going back to apple watch
4728,is it too heavy to play golf while on
4729,40m is not huge for scuba btw
4730,concerning the bulkiness of the watch i do not think it is meant to be fashionable a a priority but to be a utility watch first and foremost
4731,where them air pod pro
4732,i personally wish the regular watch did not have a curved display
4733,apple watch g shock edition
4734,finally the omnitrix is here
4735,let is just buy it for battery life
4736,a a mountain of a man i can not wear anything smaller than a 47 48mm without it looking like i am wearing a kid watch so it is my only real option plus with all the cool doodad i guess it is worth it
4737,how doe sleeping with it on feel
4738,the flex with the calorie wa legendary ngl
4739,will we get watch 5 pro review
4740,i am pretty sure when apple label something pro they mean customer who will use our product and make them look the way we want them to this doe not include the rugged and durable customer base that would want this watch so it is not pro
4741,review of a product is easier than to manufacture a product
4742,i hate the smart watch from apple and samsung i wear 2 watch currenly 1 2 88 inch full android one which is basically a full tiny smartphone that need to be chrarged every night and a cheaper one one my other wrist that last well over a week on a charge for health tracking i would like to get one that would be somewhere in the middle with functionality and battery life but no one make anything i would even concider for any price
4743,damn a nice catch at 13 08
4744,you switch your watch for playing ultimate frisbee or is the image just mirrored 0 27
4745,come on marque that intro
4746,wait you compared a normal watch to a smart watch for battery life that doe not make sense
4747,i just wan na run around like a fallout character
4748,hey marque sorry to bother you but i wa wondering where we could watch your match thank you
4749,shout out to wearing a watch on the right instead of left wrist i am also a right wrist r
4750,damn my 1st gen se doe not even last 2 day and it is not even a year old smh
4751,i m kinda sad u showed the really basic watch but nothing like an garmin epix 2 or fenix 7 or something which would be a much better comparison
4752,i am one of those people outside the circle that you draw im outside because im broke af if they want to get me to use an apple watch it need to be like 50dollar or something
4753,cutout button x 2
4754,i believe that serious sporty person those who are not going outdoors just for the pic will go with better more specialized and obviously with better battery choice such a garmin sunto etc
4755,you bet
4756,i saw dell xps 15 when did you get an dell xps 15 you never reviewed it
4757,wow 2 day few year ago huawei released their watch watch with 2 week of battery life with same feature ant cost 4 time lower american
4758,literally look even more like a phone on wrist now really ugly s
4759,mkbhd back with the classic song
4760,the new compass app with all the feature is on series 6 and newer albeit without the extra gps functionality
4761,is this watch good for couch potato asking for a friend
4762,too big
4763,what i am really excited for is the alpine loop it is a shame they do not sell it with stainless steel lug but i think it look super cool and i would love ot get one for my series 7
4764,absolutely phenomenal video
4765,nah
4766,the last thing you would want is to stick out at the met gala a flashy watch would be overkill for sure
4767,holy shit marque you work off more calorie than i eat in a day the whole time i am thinking a man who eats 4500 calorie a day look like henry cavill i had not even considered that he could look like mkbhd
4768,tbh i have never been tempted by any apple product before other than maybe their recent ipad but i will have to say this particular watch doe make want wan na have it and go seek out adventure just so that i can use it
4769,at least your wrist is big enough to handle the watch some of these people wearing it are not getting how silly they look and it should be dlc coated to give it a black color you should start wearing real watch smart watch to me are done
4770,nomad ha a titanium band that i think will go really well in dressing up the aw ultra i am definitely giving it a go leaving my hone home on a long distance training run and relying 100percent on the apple watch with cellular is probably the biggest draw for me
4771,bro buy garmin and you will have 2 week of batter life xd
4772,shoulda went pro ultra seems more samsung y my opinion
4773,oof
4774,it need tank pressure air integration to swing u scuba ppl apple ha only been able to get some of u on board and only a a backup secondary dive computer not to mention they charge a subscription fee for the dive software
4775,why is nobody asking why apple watch chipset is not more energy efficient adding more battery and bulk isn the way
4776,that thing look ugly on a wrist
4777,5 03 i have same scar lol i had wrist reconstruction after car accident
4778,intro music and video is incredible
4779,we have officially reached new level of crazy dollar800 for a watch no matter how many feature it ha is ridiculous
4780,we have had watch cost a lot more with a lot le feature for a very long time lol
4781,69percent wa not intentional at all
4782,a a skier this product seems very appealing being to go to the mountain and go into 10 degree weather without any worry seems very appealing a well a going camping for a multiday weekend and not needing to worry about the battery life
4783,i am an introvert who work in an office and i am dying for one guess i will buy it
4784,when marque drew the first circle i thought he wa gon na draw the sad face troll with the big chin meme
4785,that outro wa lovely
4786,is there a specific reason why you swap the arm on which you are wearing the watch over the day
4787,just like the word professional in the 60 70 is a professional wa a doctor or lawyer now everyone is a professional it seems
4788,bad battery if you compare to even some 200dollar watch
4789,i am a serious hiker backpacker and i still do not see this a a good sell for people like me dollar800 for the thing and needing to charge it every 2 day is just a dead weight in my backpack once it dy i would rather bring my phone and use gaia gps for navigation and have a backup real map and compass for navigation if my phone dy which lead me to my next point i would want my phone charger to power just my phone and recharge my garmin inreach which would actually be useful in an so situation something the ultra doe not do i think if apple added the so function the way they did on the iphone 14 it would make it somehow more useful but first and foremost is battery life which would need to be improved for going on multi day adventure
4790,bruh the editing of the video is next level
4791,your every video is just a commercial i swear
4792,the god damn at the beginning killed me
4793,that calorie burn though
4794,still garmins last for week if not month on battery like if i would be into so demending sport or working in rough environment garmin it is just a better choice
4795,loved the editing subtle yet poppy
4796,how doe this stack up against the sense 2 i have a first gen sense and it is not bad for the price but i am looking for something to take my health and health tracking to a different level
4797,i bought it because of the dive computer and the awesome hike friendly watch face i feel like this is the first iwatch that is perfectly suited to me
4798,for the algorithm
4799,i want it but not for 800
4800,i have a series 7 apple watch and been tempted buying this appel watch ultra since i have my 14 pro max i feel i need it lmao
4801,the choice today buy dollar800 apple or buy more extra storable food for the coming apocalypse
4802,how accurate is the calorie count and algorithm of the apple watch from what i understand sometimes there can be big fluctuation between the actual number of burned calorie v the calorie that the watch say we burn
4803,9 24 great way to visualize
4804,look like marque had some kind of injury and had done extensor tendon repair neat scar though
4805,i miss the simple day when i would just look at my watch for the time or have it on to look cool were looking at thing so much we need to look at the world an people a little more
4806,if i may ask what is your wrist size
4807,worst review in whole of youtube sometimes just visuals do not get the point across there ha to be a story and a solid review to back it
4808,regarding a black version apple could make a dlc coating diamond like coating version it is semi common in the watch world and could probably be added a a dollar30 to dollar40 option for the watch it is a resilient coating one of the common us is on engine part and would actually be a benefit to the ruggedness of the watch a one of the disadvantage of titanium in the watch world is that it scratch easier than stainless steel watch unless it is treated with a hardness coating
4809,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4810,i am thinking they went with titanium for corrosion resistance v outright hardness not to mention titanium sound cooler and expensive than stainless lol it is also lighter
4811,the series 7 titanium watch i believe is anodized to increase wear resistance
4812,the stainless had dlc so apple know it is a thing
4813,great idea
4814,mkbhd never disappoints with intro
4815,great content can not you put a black case cover on it
4816,holy smoke 1750 cals for throwing a disc mind blown
4817,to think you can use this a a dive computer is almost a funny a the watch look
4818,i just hate how you talk about some of the feature but you didnt show it working in the video
4819,dollar800 there is a lot money can do give it to orphan take your friend out buy a two way ticket and go tour around africa you can also send it to your mum
4820,it is morphing time with the apple watch ultra
4821,that intro wa bunker
4822,hell to the no
4823,kure kashtappett iphone vaangich apple watch vaangaan sheshi illa
4824,me who doe not wear a normal watch watching a video of a watch if it worth 800 dollar
4825,got it for diving let is see if it is worth it
4826,ha everyone seen jerry is apple watch ultra
4827,marque gripping onto that yoke for dear life in those shot lol
4828,normally take out when you are not working out i have a garmin forerunner i do not take it off unless to charge it nor did i ever take my analog watch off before i do not know anyone who take their watch off after without there are other metric like sleep to keep track of this very same question wa asked on reddit and the comment unanimously agreed that they did not take their watch off unless to charge them or to shower
4829,dumb phone replacement
4830,short answer no long answer absolutely not
4831,a a storm spotter and storm chaser this would be essential durability waterproof red mode crash detection fall detection emergency so this would be amazing to have with me every day
4832,rabbitisgoodrabbitiswise yes i forgot about that
4833,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4834,not to mention you can use radarscope on it
4835,they need a smaller version of the ultra
4836,golf ha been trying to make black golf club for a long time and it is impossible to keep the black they always look like trash in two year apple prob came to the same conclusion
4837,getting one for free
4838,why doe your arm shake so much 8 15
4839,nearly 3 4 of a million view in 4 hour damn
4840,apple we have 3 day garmin eat my dirt we have 60 garmin enduro 2
4841,did i just hear 100 usd strap
4842,i burn 1 100 calorie in 8 hour of work damnn i got ta start doing practice too
4843,apple is definitely effective in finding way to get every possible demographic into their eco system whether we notice or not they might not get everyone but if they can get close well by god they will try lol
4844,link that pen in the comment
4845,like most i stare at my damn phone way too much a much a i try to minimize my usage the temptation is often too much to overcome this is why i love my cellular apple watch leaving my phone behind make it impossible to go down a rabbit hole and force me to be present i look at all the people at the gym staring at their phone instead of working out and realize i would be just like them without it the battery put the brake on that pretty quick and the screen size mean you are left squinting though this watch fix all of that for me
4846,what is that keyboard that should be in a dope tech video
4847,this is a premium video
4848,i really just want a big watch like this without all the feature tbh
4849,i am tempted by it mostly for it look a well a not having to charge every single day prior to apple watch i always went with large rugged watch due to the look and feel and whilst i love the functionality of mine it always feel too small and light for my wrist i think anybody who like a chunky watch and could afford the ultra is going to be tempted
4850,wth is ultimate frisbee practice who practice for kid game
4851,yeah we all know that is kinda the same watch like series 8 but another reviewer put also the factor of how mainstream the apple watch is so with the ultra on the hand look let is say different even tho i have the series 6 which basically is the same like the series 8 i am upgrading just for that different feeling of a new toy and if i may someday need those feature i know that they are there hehe
4852,0 12 the way you are holding your steering wheel is bothering me
4853,so the day you get that io upgrade doe it suddenly last 2 hour you know like every other planned obsolescence device apple make i must give prop to apple for promoting the madness of consumption of shit you do not need i suggest for a real adventure try leaving your phone in the car you might even survive maybe
4854,they could not name it the apple watch pro because lg owns the patent to the naming watch pro
4855,i am a small dude and i feel like it would be absolutely massive on my arm i have the biggest serious 7 and it still seems a little big
4856,too much un skip able ad in your video
4857,this watch is for the in between people no one who really is into their preferred hobby is buying this you would use the correct tool for the correct hobby garmin and sunnto and shearwater dive cpu are way better than this apple watch why would some buy 2 3 day batter life watch that cost dollar800 when you could buy a garmin or casio solar that give you 30 day
4858,attention android user the apple watch is a product that make you buy a iphone
4859,damn you could hit somebody in head with that metal block while you work out
4860,my apple watch series 8 is coming today very excited i actually wanted the ultra but mostly for the battery life and the flat display but after thinking it over i just could not justify dollar800 for a watch that only had two feature i liked the rest of the feature i would probably never use it is a nice watch though it is also huge and i am a small female so it would probably be too big for my wrist apple please make a female version of the ultra
4861,paying dollar800 for a disposable watch people have lost their gd mind
4862,side question do you get payed for playing frisbee
4863,i want it
4864,i am one of the outside of the circle people if apple wa to come up with a hybrid watch then i would think about it smartwatches are ugly it is not because it is rectangular there are rectangular watch that are beautiful it because it is too big too black i would love to have a beautiful off white faced watch that ha sensor and can show me text message and can play music there are some but they are not apple right if there wa a hybrid apple watch with a nice face a hidden screen smaller i would think about it but even the hybrid watch that exist are kinda ugly my swiss army watch with sensor apple music player and a compass would be awesome
4865,well i am a wheelchair patient so i do not do activity like hiking or diving etc but there are still some nice feature that this bigger apple watch ultra ha that appeal to me especially the bigger battery life since i can get longer out of this watch for my heart rate measuring it ha a nice big screen which i also really like i do like the orange color of the button a well though i also wish it would just come in black now a a fashion jewel i must say there are still big watch that people wear and go on special event on with and even though these watch are mostly truly jewel rolex they are also big if you wear the apple watch ultra you could use a more muted band maybe some type of off white or something like that which would color match the awu i think i might get this watch i am not completely sure yet the price is also something to consider a in my country the awu cost dollar1k
4866,peasant watch
4867,battery life is the only reason i want own one i never take a watch off
4868,okay who at the studio owns the john mayer x hodinkee g shock
4869,he would never use this but david goggins would be perfect for this
4870,a a musician i still miss the soundbrenner function
4871,i do not run swim or hike i just want a bigger watch face and longer battery life over my series 5 that last 16 hors max getting my ultra this friday
4872,800dollar watch i will go to rolex amp rado if i want an expensive watch
4873,the montage really look like some carzy as apple advertisement period
4874,this wa basically just a 15 minute flex of how intense mb is workout are haha
4875,ultra spelled out with scrabble letter 2 46 never cease to take it to the next level mkbhd
4876,a pilot here and a watch aficionado that i love the simple design of old timepiece diver flieger and cartier tank solo design with the quartz movement because they are more accurate and practical than mechanical one i like this small piece of intricate tech engineering but i see that it deserves the name of a smart bracelet more than a watch a watch is a piece of beauty that ha only a single function time
4877,i have a series 8 and waypoint marker seems to work so it may be a watchos 9 feature rather than just the ultra
4878,how do you set the waypoints
4879,i am a gym rat so i ordered one good to know that it is a healthy improvement over my 6 series
4880,if your working out do not you go off your active calorie not the total
4881,can not wait to receive mine this friday
4882,calling it ultra sound like samsung vibe
4883,69 percent battery markass nice
4884,of course if you compare every car against a hummer than it is not so big
4885,i just wish my watch 3 battery wa not expanding apple bud that pretty well while they were still selling it
4886,i did not know that apple watch had such horrible battery life before this video the fact that two day is great is kinda sad a someone who wear a mifit 5 band for two week straight before washing it and charging it i find that anything larger than a bracelet and without at least a week of battery life would be too cumbersome the only feature that i feel like i am missing nfc and being able food to a calorie tracker or starting ending a fast for me apple watch a it is already have a narrow appeal a they only attract apple user who do not have good comparability option having to constantly take it off and recharge at best every two day brings down from being a watch to another electric device to babysit i always thought people bought them becouse they had good feature i guess not lmfao
4887,if one love casio watch he never gon na appreciate apple watch including me fun fact
4888,apple is getting you ready for the apple watch ultra pro
4889,apple could not name it the apple pro bcuz samsung already named the watch 5 pro
4890,this watch cost euros999 in france way way beyond what i can afford
4891,13 06 that drive
4892,i think the ultra is supposed to be a new market segment pro is more upscale luxurious while ultra is for a rugged lifestyle think lexus mercedes v landrover wrangler
4893,i feel like a large segment i fall into is missing people that cycle loooooong distance i ride century frequently and even though i may use a dedicated bike computer for speed cadence and the like i still use my apple watch for heart rate zone monitoring and calorie counting i can not make it through a full century without charging my watch i am upgrading my old series 4 to the ultra specifically for the battery life and gps a it relates to long distance cycling
4894,apple did not solve the problem why i do not use apple watch a a northern european guy who doe lot of endurance sport like cross country skiieng i can not track the sport i do with the watch i can add some of the sport i do in the training app but i can not select what to track gps is the most needed in endurance sport there is third party apps but have not found one i would like to use also the price of the ultra is ridiculous when compared to other brand like suunto and polar i can get what i need for third of the price i just need to deal with much worse user experience perfect watch still not exists suunto polar apple combination would kill it
4895,this is a watch or a monitor on wrist so freaking big
4896,hey marque how wa your day him nice i slept in 69 with siri
4897,i just needed a last word of advice before going bonkers with this watch and i just had it here it is almost the same price a the steel one have more feature le elegant that is fo sho but at the same time i am practically sully from monster inc my hand are enormous even to the point that the normal size iphone it is small to me so yeah definitely going ultra this time thank you for your review marque
4898,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4899,i have ordered one a i plan on climbing mount couchamanjaro that is just over the couch cushion into a more comfortable position i love big watch and always found apple watch too small for me i have had a fair few of them my last one wa the s 6 i can not wait for friday for the ultra to arrive
4900,got the money to burn why not my iphone ha a clock billion of application available ten of million of song and music video news weather and yes cat video do not need a smart watch
4901,phd video editing
4902,a big thing for diver is that it doe not keep track of your tank and other feature that should be an automatic no go it is cool that apple is trying to envelope all different stuff but more specialized watch are way better and they should be bought in order to support the creator who actually do good work
4903,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
4904,i would venture that 90percent of people who buy dive watch have never been in anything deeper than a hotel swimming pool
4905,apple should hire whoever edit your intro for their ad
4906,love the review very simple and honest
4907,what happened to the much promised sugar sensor for the million of diabetic very disappointing to check insulin requirement
4908,hi
4909,hi
4910,hi
4911,hi
4912,hi
4913,hi
4914,watch pro trademark is owned by someone else this could potentially be why it is called ultra
4915,wa that an ultimate frisbee workout on the watch workout app
4916,once you fall for watch and make a hobby of collecting watch you will appreciate the g shock analogue vintage kind of watch i never seen a watch collector ever been so interested on apply watch
4917,charged my garmin fenix 6 pro x about a week ago 11 day left exercised and or cycled every day with gps and heart rate transmit feature on i upgraded from an other garmin a a 3 day battery on a watch is unacceptable for me just my 2c i use about zero smart watch feature other than exercise and health tracking also my last watch had touch worst thing for a sport you do in glove and rain and mud
4918,also the lack of ant support is a big issue for bikers e bikers you can not transmit heart rate or talk to speed cadence or e bike sensor either nor ant ant enabled gym machine generally i saw a similar response to mine on every bike video on this watch it is nice if you ride once a week if you want 24 7 tracking and long battery and ant support then this would work a a 2nd watch for office day or hanging out i understand why people like it and i want one too the problem is that it would end up in the drawer next to the other gadget i wanted then replaced with others that i needed
4919,i am actually surprise that this watch is compelling to me the gen 7 watch requires me to charge mid hike if i track my workout or else i risk loosing it also in the middle of the day heat in the desert i normally have to turn and place my watch in my shadow to see the screen lastly in 112 degree heat i found the watch overheated and would not display data i hope this ultra watch can stand up to the heat better the gps might be somewhat useful for navigating canyon where gps tends to get squirly but it not often you get lost in a canyon because there is normally only two direction to navigate
4920,are you in az because i relate to this comment so much haha
4921,damn bro wipe the screen of your fingerprint
4922,the greatest piece of tech in history
4923,why do you use watch on your right wrist
4924,what is his wrist size
4925,meanwhile amazfit t rex user laughing in corner
4926,a an aircraft maintenance engineer working in harsh environment and often in bright sunlight that watch look very tempting rugged design larger button and digital crown look louder speaker are also crucial while communicating with teammate airplane happen to be quite loud
4927,the samsung is galaxy watch is pro and apple named it ultra
4928,thinking about getting this being in the army we are constantly doing thing outdoors working with our hand i love my apple watch but the material on the ultra are perfect
4929,they can easily do the black in titanium i have the watch series 5 in black titanium amp it ha held up very well in these year since owning amp wearing daily bummed out on this but would not be surprised that in apple fashion they do another surprise launch by eoy that introduces a pro model since they did not introduce any edition model this time
4930,marque let is be real you do not just want a black apple watch ultra you want a black apple watch ultra with a red action button apple watch ultra mkbhd edition
4931,i am an average college student at purdue university so my apple watch series 4 ha been great for my need i play disc golf on the purdue team and waypoints could be game changing being able to set them during a practice round will allow me to see where the basket is on blind tee shot see where my shot ending up in the past and have a better idea of the course the ability to measure how far my throw using waypoints is also super helpful information for consistency all this with a brighter screen and longer battery life wa hard to ignore i wa excited before watching your review but now i can not wait
4932,what is your wrist size
4933,unless these become compatible with regular magsafe it is not worth it to me i also feel like watch should have a week worth of battery i can not take measuring a watch is life in hour that being said this is coming from someone who is iphone 13 pro is at 93percent battery capacity so i am probably a worst case user
4934,middle of nowhere part wa hilarious
4935,that intro
4936,gawd that tesla yoke look so stupid and uncomfortable
4937,i liked the last plugin about the mkbhd i am only worried about the size of it which is crucial for the battery life but may hinder day to day activity i suppose
4938,they should put dlc black coating on it it would be unbeatable
4939,playing frisbee increased your height or it is in your gene marque
4940,i got this from aliexpress for buck very nice but would not pay dollar800 for it naah definitely not worth it
4941,a a pilot the red filter for night flight is a massive upgrade in it self the brighter screen and better battery life is only the cherry on top of the cake ez decision even if it will never be used for any hardcore stuff
4942,ir video are very much white plz balance white tone it wa not like this 3 4 yr back make a selection of natural colour science
4943,my watch ha a solar panel so i never need to charge it
4944,i am an avid watch user i have never checked time on my phone my mind is programed to twist my arm whenever i want to check time but apple watch is simply an extra burden for me i have used the 3rd gen apple watch for some time and i never used it apart from checking time plus the burden of charging every other day it is one le thing to charge my desk is already cluttered with too much of wire n charger why use an apple watch
4945,just 3 hour session and you already are burning calorie oh my someone give a medal to that man
4946,so doe a 2 day plus battery to do 98percent of the regular stuff an se can do worth the price especially when you are most likely gon na end up at home with enough time to recharge
4947,i finally want an apple watch bruh orange got me
4948,what is that mark on your hand
4949,8 19 why is your hand shaking
4950,middle of nowhere
4951,ultra is an overkill in some area but baterrywise it is nothing in comparison with the like of garmin
4952,you compared it with asus phone but this watch is almost priced a that full over board phone especially when there are deal
4953,what an intro
4954,you are that person who wear their watch in the right cringe
4955,this video is fake no one buy what you need so stop it with the fake video you only do for apple product stop explaining this stuff u u like we do not know anything no one care we all buy what we want even if it cost a lot do i need to explain that to you
4956,did not realize you were and artist marque that drawing wow
4957,where is the falcon heavy shirt from
4958,you should try the huawei watch i get 5 day of battery time easy one mine it go up to 20 if i go eco with it
4959,did you switch from your left and right wrist just for testing or what
4960,i am sure he ha a lot of rich friend at ultimate frisbee lol
4961,wowzerz a whole 2 day on battery lol
4962,why are you wearing it on the right hand
4963,definitely overkill for me but i have a series 4 and had been wanting to update to a watch with always on display so i have an ultra on order people were expecting this pro watch to be over dollar1k which would have been an easy pas for me when it came in at dollar799 it made it appear a a bargain and motivated people to buy i think apple planted those gt dollar1k rumor
4964,definitely they did the same thing with the first ipad back in the day it wa thought to cost dollar800 1000 everybody went wild when they introduced it at dollar500
4965,bro you spent 800 dollar on a watch cmon now let is use our head here
4966,that make me feel better a bit overkill for me too but i have been holding on to my series 3 got it on order myself
4967,that is the same spot i am in i have a 4 which is still kicking but i would love an always on display
4968,02 19 used up all the motion graphic budget for the intro so i guess we got ta just do this one with pen and paper love the easter egg of the scrabble letter though
4969,this is not worth it
4970,people will only buy this for the better battery life alone
4971,pas this is ugly and old looking time for time to go
4972,they called it apple watch ultra rather than pro for the same reason it wa not called the iwatch probably
4973,great video i am getting it a an upgrade from my series 5 to reduce the time i need to take it off right now i take it off when i sleep go on weekend hiking trip go sailing go skiing and play badminton since my partner accidentally hit it with their racket i am just hoping it look acceptable to wear at work too
4974,do not understand why the action button had to be orange tho stick out like a sore thumb
4975,i definitely do not dive run marathon or hike but that larger screen longer battery life extra button speaker and microphone wa a no brainier upgrade from my series 4 and with it only being gbp20 difference from a stainless steel series 8 it wa not a hard decision
4976,imho look good on your wrist too it is not too big
4977,what if this entire video wa just a ploy for marque to show off his ultimate highlight
4978,hand down the best quality video currently on youtube thanks marque for always pushing the youtube community to keep upgrading and bettering their quality
4979,watch on right hand make me disturbed
4980,i am a business person that like to dress up my watch band for travel and meeting and then replace it when i am home with one of my nike sport band i am curious what this ultra look like with a nice dressy band for example maybe the apple leather magnetic band i currently use a milanese loop on my apple watch for business event i am guessing there is no version of the milanese that would look good with the ultra but it might be worth seeing it would be awesome if you could do sort of a style review and show with the ultra look like with band other than the new trail loop and ocean band
4981,apple almost got me with this one i really like look of it and i am a hipster i guess but i am still not gon na buy it i think it another unnesassery radiation to have it on my body every day and night
4982,the cinematography and motion graphic in this video are inspiring a hell dude
4983,sadly this would be too big on my wrist great review
4984,i have no intent in using the ultra for these crazy activity i just like the look size battery and screen brightness so i ordered one
4985,what is the circumference of your wrist
4986,colorware will solve your problem soon
4987,ultra is for a smaller niche
4988,sale will also be for regular people who have the money same way a iphone pro model even if they do not need extra feature it a cool watch i would buy if i had the money even if i am not intro extreme sport
4989,this fucking enormously ugly watch ha a long battery life no shit
4990,13 07 nice
4991,why would you not bend this phone slightly so it fit better to the wrist 2022 this should be possible
4992,please review also the airpods pro 2
4993,there is still not an apple watch that even doe anything functional they literally just tell the time the apps are fake they do not do anything and most do not even work the cellular service on the watch work half the time maybe it appears to be a tracking and data collection device a those function are very powerful and work perfectly 100percent of the time all other function of the watch are negligible or downright misrepresented a useful
4994,why do you keep doing this you talked about garmin and other watch lasting forever and then you compared this against the most basic screen in the market this is pure marketing why do not you show a garmin epix 2 that can last 2 3 week in regular mode and even more in battery save mode i mean it ha a touch screen topographic map and multiple gps system if you go camping 2 day of battery is nothing and if you use gps that battery consumption will shrink to most likely 5 hour max you might have power bank for essential and watch is not essential this is a first attempt to get closer to the ultra smart watch not the casio you showed is not close and a of now is good for regular user in their daily basis you are really forcing this idea
4995,geez 800 what is wrong with apple fan
4996,intro song voice by 20syl
4997,the airpods dying noise in the intro made me so mad thinking mine were dead
4998,2 000 calorie in 3 hour is insane that is like a whole day worth of calorie
4999,how many homekit accessory do you have in your network i noticed that homekit is quite extensively killing battery on apple watch
5000,15mins straight of marq making excuse for every iphone ultra feature though not a convincing reason why it is called ultra and not pro good job
5001,wrist and pocket must be big enough to buy this thing
5002,this watch deserves the satellite connectivity feature more than the iphone 14
5003,you got ta chilll with editing and animation i am wetting myself over how good it is
5004,2 10 create a channel named mkbhd pro for pro viewer 3
5005,i am heart patient and i have seizure ecg and irregular heart rhythm detector wa pretty helpful to track on my heart beat even though it doe not detect hear attack but fall detection wa pretty helpful bc when i had huge fall during my seizure it sends my location to emergency contact but my series 7 watch got scratched during the episode just one scratch in middle of the screen and it bother me i use most of the feature in my watch so apple releasing a watch with extended battery and ruggedness is pretty helpful but in canada cost dollar1099 tax but it feel like it is worth it
5006,apple gay tho
5007,i do not have it yet because it doe not exist who you trying to play we know you have had that dollar t for 6 month at least haha
5008,the watch make the samsung watch 5 look beautiful compared i do not know about the design or apple is pricing strategy
5009,naaahhhh
5010,too thick
5011,normal doe not have sapphire glas
5012,hey marque what is that scar on your hand from
5013,the batterie life is simply not enough what am i gon na do with all those feature if it dy after two day plus the watch is gon na look like shit after a month of good use
5014,bro you can charge it while you sleep like who care
5015,the intro is top notch had to say it apple should pay up to use it
5016,swapping wrist strange
5017,i like the ultra scrabble tile on the sketch part nice little easter egg
5018,i am surprised they are allowed to wear watch in ultimate frisbee game i know in highschool i wa not
5019,can you compare an apple watch to a casio
5020,dear mkbhd 2 full day and 2 full night is 2 full day
5021,it is because they intend to release new color next year
5022,interesting it wa not mentioned that the ultra screen is virtually the same size a the larger series 8 i would like to have known if the flat face make it seem better make it easier to use etc
5023,your scar is nasty bro
5024,i am very interested but will wait a year before upgrading my series 4 to see how third party take advantage of the watch and what else apple doe with the second version
5025,nice
5026,a a competitive runner the only reason why i could not use the regular apple watch wa because it wa missing a lap function with a dedicated button thanks for the review it look great
5027,i also feel this is starting to swing in the garmin type sector like how you said in the video most people have garmins that are huge and accurate in their tracking but it is also jammed packed with sensor and feature to accommodate a well a the price range
5028,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5029,and they last for week longer than apple is watch ultra even in the ultra is 60 hour battery saving mode apple writes in the fine print of the product page that it turn off the heart rate and gps sensor just to make it last that long garmin ha both heart rate and gps going for at least 96 hour and multiple day longer if gps is turned off apple would have to change the display technology completely to be able to get it to last longer than 60 hour
5030,i think it need significan notly better battery life offline mapping and more comprehensive fitness focused metric to be a true competitor
5031,my garmin last for about 9 day between charge with a decent amount of gps usage for activity during that time it cost le than half and imo look a whole lot nicer i have got no interest in this watch i am also an android user so this just would not work well in general
5032,a a recreational runner i will still stick with my garmin it just feel way more specialized and ha a lot more data that help me a lot it also pair with the garmin hr monitor to give me super accurate hr monitoring info about my vertical movement and more accurate cadence measurement
5033,this watch is making the iphone se 3rd gen a15 watch ultra a more workable viable combo than iphone 14 a15 watch series 8
5034,god tier graphic
5035,can we use the 45 mm band with this watch
5036,garmin measure their battery life in month not hour
5037,my reason for not getting the new apple watch is it is not android
5038,honey wake up marque posted
5039,dlc is how watch go black
5040,ooh nice lego bonsai tree in the back i have one too
5041,do you expect many ultra feature to be found in future iteration of the regular apple watch
5042,so marcus you are percent100 wrong a black titanium watch dose not scratch easy i have got a series 5 apple watch edition space black that i have been wearing daily a of tomorrow 3 year and it still doe not have a single scratch on the case the screen ha one very faint scratch that can be seen in bright light the battery is at percent85 i am hearing impaired and use it a an alarm clock so i wear it about 23 hour a day i have been wearing a apple watch since the series 23 hour a day i charge in the morning when i shower and when i come home when i am relaxing at the end of my day i am not happy that they discontinued the edition a i wa planning on buying a new one this year
5043,nah
5044,get a thin case in black thatll hide it
5045,with a watch like this apple should add full feature of iphone in it with excellent voice command feature so we can not type msg on it
5046,even though i have not been an apple fan lately and yes i do have iphone and ipad even though apple doe not do a much a samsung doe i will say apple watch is not better than samsung but apple watch are really good i have an apple watch and it work amazing and battery life is really good a well but i think it is because u can not really and much to it i have apple watch 6 and will not be upgrading
5047,i sense an iphone 15 ultra coming next year
5048,it is not pro because it is meant for ultra activity like very extreme one check the promo video that is the reason
5049,a garmin fenix ha an entire map of the united state with a 2 week battery life if im hardcore i would just buy that a bunch of waypoints are not useful
5050,the editing on this video wa insane we should all be thankful for such all around high quality content
5051,for me the top thing is that you get titanium and sapphire this is cool tech in itself like space and aero material rigid light rare
5052,nice
5053,sometimes i can not stand your snarky remark you are so sassy
5054,you are using the old band and an old watch face killing me
5055,it is really a luxury to own an apple watch
5056,aesthetic do not matter to those who are relying on the watch for what it doe v what it look like a an avid hiker that ha had the apple watch battery die on long hike this is a no brainer
5057,your editor need a raise
5058,you look bored buddy to present the apple item it is because you not buying man before you happy and join the new staff bufd
5059,love the visuals
5060,pro mean professional however the ultra is not for professional in the workplace it is for ultra marathonners so pro would not make sense at all in this case love the content
5061,wearing on your right hand i do a well can you not flip everything so the wheel is on the finger side i wear a galaxy watch 4 and the 2 button allow the entire interface to be flipped for southpaw this seems like a obvious thing where you are not accidentally pushing the new button by reaching over
5062,so is there a topo map app etc for this watch that would be a killer feature for me however i am not seeing support for that
5063,galaxy watch review please
5064,if my wrist were not so tiny this would be a definite yes but it is just too huge for me to be able to pull off without looking like a moron
5065,professional for pro and ultra for everyone
5066,apple is going to sell a boat load of these ultras i do not have an apple watch and i am tempted to get an ultra
5067,please add some background music it will be more interesting
5068,it is a powerhungry computer that is not really rugged that ha a poor battery which still can not sync to the ipad
5069,i am a nah
5070,watch is for an urban hiker not a real one day battery life
5071,am i the only one who is a little worried that his average heart rate when practicing wa about 130bpm
5072,love the channel bro keep it up
5073,nice
5074,my series 5 barley last 1 day
5075,great review
5076,your steering wheel is broken
5077,sleep with about 69percent of battery nice
5078,watch look pretty slick but 800 for it hmm i do not know about that d
5079,the first apple product i acutally think is very cool still will not buy it way to big
5080,apple come into the golf scene please
5081,100m 100m static pressure is realistically 10meters dynamic pressure get it right
5082,honestly design vise it look obnoxious
5083,i like how marquez say ppppro
5084,hey marque how talk are you 6 3
5085,i can not stop seeing a gland from the front on you t shirt
5086,it is weird that every time i eat breakfast i watch mkbhd
5087,woah i just noticed marque is left handed
5088,got the samsung watch5 pro without aod it get about 96 hour with sleep tracking with aod it around 55 60 hour
5089,man i went to check that leather watch strap and it is out of stock for the 42 44 45mm size
5090,why is your watch on the wrong wrist
5091,there is no wrong wrist for a watch
5092,i do not even run marathon but a a collegiate runner this is far more appealing to me than any previous watch i have always been a hardcore garmin guy but this competes handily with the added apple feature the price start to make a lil sense
5093,just fyi you can buy a dollar20 casio with a 10 year battery life at walmart kinda bugged me when he wa talk about better watch having better battery life better watch do not use a battery and use a kinetic mechanism to power the watch
5094,those are not better watch those are cheap watch that just tell the time and do not really do anything
5095,marque can you let u know your wrist circumference so we can get an idea of how the apple watch ultra would wear since it is square it would not wear like a 49mm circular watch i would hope nobody want an apple watch invicta edition
5096,god damn that is huge
5097,what size is your wrist i have been waiting on somebody to say that so everybody can measure the wrist know how big it is if they bought it
5098,just like the new iphone not worth it
5099,ok seeing it on your wrist make me wonder if it would actually work on my own it doe not seem a large a i thought
5100,mkbhd you used to be the greatest youtube tech reviewer for almost everyone but i hope you know you are far from that now you are now an apple ambassador how come you have reviewed the watch ultra launched 2 week ago but did not bother to review the galaxy watch 5 pro of over a month it a shame how far you are drifting
5101,i do not want the apple watch to lock me down to apple forever
5102,i run ultra marathon and i still got a garmin forerunner instead the battery life for this may still not be enough for me not to mention all the other accessory you can connect with garmin for exercise the garmin ha 48 hour of battery in gps mode and week of a charge in smart watch mode i currently have the apple watch series 4 a well i am looking to break a little more from the apple walled garden
5103,they do not need those market apple they are targeting they actually targetting wannabe is who think they are advance user when they have it and that market is huge the same go with trail bikers who us ebike
5104,funny thing i bought the apple watch ultra a a father i want to prevent scratch on the playground louder speaker are needed and the action button is very welcome and when i pas my apple watch to a family member the battery life is quite a problem with a bigger battery you have a higher percentage of a higher capacity battery left great the icing on the cake is a better gps location when geocaching in forest nothing ultra but ultra great to me
5105,i do not like having a case to prevent scratch i know what you about the playground issue i need a better battery and etc because i like to sleep with watch on honestly i just like deep dive aspect of it because i do not trust the whole water resistant sale point
5106,thx for this reviewm so useful
5107,my xioami wrist band ha everything i need and the battery last 2 week
5108,i have a scar on my hand in the same place a yours and have a skinny wrist like yours
5109,might be my favorite mkbhd intro
5110,alright i loved the paper and people drawing but even i can not be the triathlon guy or whatever but i think that anyone on those ring that you draw everyone want good battery life and i am not using always on and i also disable background app refresh on my apple watch i am sure that i can get a lot with the ultra i am using series 5 a bit old now and over time with all the feature turn down like i have said i can do a day like 24h period and if i have like someone calling me like let is do a party or something or just hanging out late i know that i need ultra time to recharge my serie 5 and think about that throughout my day i just want the battery from the ultra or near well i know that the serie 7 or 8 battery are way better tho i do not know
5111,those animation though your intro game is unreachable mkbhd and team keep up back to video
5112,please do a review of the galaxy watch5 and 5 pro i would love to hear your opinion
5113,the ultra name wa a good choice a it show this is a big upgrade
5114,the shape of that watch reminds me of the og iphone had a baby with a braun radio from the 50
5115,maybe it is not the highest best version yet
5116,it not named pro which only mean one thing there will be an apple watch pro next year with feature that probably qualify a pro but not all the way up to ultra if that make sense
5117,i have owned some wrist watch that only tell time that when adjusted for inflation would cost more than the apple watch ultra when it come to watch the new apple watch 8 ultra i feel come in at a very good price of dollar 799 00 one thing so far i have not herd from most of the pundit is the flat sapphire crystal and protection up to the edge this is a big feature for me have had sapphire on my watch before i moved to an apple watch my first apple watch screen took a beating and wa a little scratched up now my apple watch 5 always ha a smiling case compatible with apple watch series 6 se series 5 series 4 44mm with built in tempered glass screen protector overall protective hard pc case ultra thin cover clear so far no scratch however when i sweat the perspiration get under the protector so i have to take it off to dry it out when i get home if i did not already have an apple watch the apple watch 8 ultra is the model i would purchase thing is since i already have the apple watch 5 that doe everything i want it to do except glucose monitoring really want or blood pressure monitoring would be nice i will stick with my apple watch 5
5118,best tech video on the internet
5119,this is the best with the red light battery sat connectivity 100 meter 2000nitts i mean this is the best
5120,i am a cyclist this watch might work and not just die after a three hour ride of the normal watch
5121,sir the quality of your video over the last few week ha definitely taken another huge leap forward and i am here for it the apple watch is cool too
5122,the intro a madness bye
5123,yet another met gala flex getting mile out of that one
5124,800dollar 3 day of batery 40dollar 2 week batery eco mode 3weeks of life ok yest it apple i know but 3 day this is watch not phone when i start working for 5000dollar monthy i will take it just like new satelite help message work ony in usa nice feature
5125,nah unless you actually do real wilderness stuff even then i recommend just get the new international ver iphone 14 and get real equipment
5126,2 day power reserve is kinda normal on a mechanical watch
5127,bro my galaxy watch it the same size a the ultra
5128,800 dollar with 72 hour of battery
5129,apple is not targeting the niche population that actually need such extreme feature the battery life alone discourages enthusiast from even considering the watch the one who will buy these are the normies who will appreciate the peace of mind from better water resistance more rugged construction brighter screen etc
5130,100m water resistance isnt a lot swimming is the most id do with 100m
5131,nice sound effect in the beginning
5132,the intro is sick tho
5133,let is talk about how sick that ultimate catch wa
5134,nice pice of useless equipment with all the respect regular apple is already useless but i can find people to which it might suit couch potato or lifestyle people whenever they need from time to time vlog activity but most used future is counting daily step every one who is serious about activity will not buy it or new super ultra version 2 day is kind of joke when my old watch started to holding 5 day i replace it with new model shape is really bad in that kind of size not everything is bad though build material are very very good i agree that they might add later black anodised version but other than that this is nice not sure who will buy it but for sure there will be some fanatic
5135,that intro gave me goosebump man
5136,2 08 what do you mean what is a pro airpods user i listen to music competitively
5137,how about u who just wan na listen to music through the apple watch speaker is it a feature yet
5138,clearly a very niche product but that niche will eat this shit up
5139,i would never wear clothes if i could why would i wear a huge watch
5140,the god tier motion graphic
5141,damn apple really made that thing ugly
5142,nothing well i am not most people lol
5143,most people prefer this design
5144,knowing apple probably not worth it they over inflate price all the time for their hardware option on computer it is whack
5145,nothing i guess i do not have a need for this kind of watch
5146,it is actually really good pricing if you consider high end dive computer go for dollar1300 easily
5147,up to a 100m but they warn you not to go below 40 m so why would they advertise it that way it false information
5148,a an ultra marathon runner i will not consider an apple watch until it offer similar analytics to garmin or other running software
5149,never buy the first version wait for the ultra 2 or 3
5150,but it is still dollar800 and for that the battery life is not there make it solar and i will consider it it need a way to changing itself if you are outdoors or lost
5151,make i
5152,the intro is sooooo sick
5153,wonder how battery life and display match between samsung watch 5 pro and apple watch 8 ultra naming scheme go burrr
5154,there is no apple watch 8 ultra you mean series 8 that is obviously below the ultra
5155,for a moment there i thought you would let the siren go off no one showed it yet curious about the sound and amplitude keep doing those great video cheer
5156,engagement comment for the algorithm
5157,apple watch ultra v g shock apple watch battery measured in day the casio in year apple watch shock and water resistant casio is tank and missile resistant apple watch will last up to 5 year casio 5 decade maybe more apple watch 799dollar casio g shock pro trek with the same feature about 300dollar
5158,nowhere near the same feature one is a diving computer and the other is literally just a watch not even a smart watch no sleep tracking workout routine siri music such an unbelivably stupid comparison
5159,am i the onlyone more sold on ultimate frisbee than the watch 2k calorie wtf
5160,i suspect most people buying this will either be upgrading from older watch or higher end user who simply want the best apple watch ever the intended audience of extreme athlete probably will only be a tiny portion of the consumer base
5161,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5162,introooooooooooooooooo
5163,great review a always marque only thing i would emphasize more is the incredible improvement in sound quality for anybody considering leaving their iphone at home occasionally and relying on the ultra a a standalone phone with my watch 7 tooling along in a jeep with mud terrain tire there wa no way to keep hand positioned on steering wheel and hear what the person on the other end of the line wa saying now for me that is totally doable the ultra is advertised a 40percent louder but it seems twice a loud a previous apple watch
5164,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5165,i usually just keep a pair of airpods around but this would be an improvement
5166,9 24 marque trying to show middle of nowhere
5167,no video on the original galaxy watch ultra but full review of the knock off bravo
5168,at the end of this video i found out that the apple ultra is worth buying
5169,intro is dope
5170,my galaxy watch sometimes last an entire week usually 5 day why is apple battery life so bad in their watch
5171,great review
5172,before i watch the video the answer is no there is no reason for an individual to waste dollar800 for a watch i believe there are poor people in the world deserve to give this money instead of apple
5173,the reason i wear a samsung smart watch is being able to use the bezel to interface with my watch a a lefty having the crown on the right side of the apple watch is a deal breaker
5174,this watch is basically only for people who are in the middle of nowhere or a lot of activity
5175,i do not get why i see a lot of people say if you buy this your basically being a tool or like a very showy type of person in my opinion it look awesome and it ha that extra battery i do not think you really have to be an extreme athlete to be able to rock this just the battery alone make it worth it for the average person
5176,i would not normally need that kind of watch but battery is the key i only do 1 2h run with gps tracking and cellular apple music via airpods this is too much for my se even with 98percent capacity i need at least 80percent battery to hope the watch would last the whole run with le battery it pretty much always die
5177,i just got the cellular apple watch 8 i could not justify the extra dollar250 for the ultra
5178,woman need to think twice before buying apple watch
5179,why
5180,minimalist must be the word apple employee use most frequently might have been their motto in everything in everything they do in the company produce design amp change to a minimal level so that when they bring something new that must be the most hyped thing around the globe
5181,the reason i do not use apple watch is the battery is trash 7 day or gtfo for this price id like even more but they decided function over battery id prefer simpler device with more battery life
5182,i am a professional diver meaning i make my living scuba diving and carry liability insurance i wa excited to hear apple wa making a watch that had diving capability but after looking at all the spec for this i got ta say they missed the mark for your once a year recreational diver it is fine i guess but for a professional it is still under par let me explain 1 yes it is missing air integration meaning i can not see my tank pressure from the computer and that to me is the most basic function of current dive computer 2 no depth gauge below 40 meter is no problem for rex diver but a a rebreather instructor i want a dive computer that will go a deep a i plan which could be 250ft 3 battery life is still sad my sherwater teric can go for well over a week not a dealbreaker but still is a disappointment 4 but for me the main concern i have is that it is an app most dive computer that is all they do calculate important info to keep you safe but i am trusting an app on a watch that wa not solely made for diving and to top it all off you have to pay a monthly subscription fee just to use the app that is just dumb i get that it is a watch that doe a lot and im glad they are making an effort but when it come to my safety and access to info i think i would stick to my teric for now but who know for the future
5183,do you play any disc golf
5184,they did not name it pro a they may be working on an apple watch ultra pro
5185,good for apple finally getting the battery upgraded although garmin still owns them in that aspect and most fitness need
5186,you said the oceanic app will have air integration but said it will not be able to monitor pressure how will it monitor air
5187,one of the main reason i drifted away from my se wa the need to charge up almost daily apart from that it is nice to have a backup phone on the wrist in case i forget mine at home
5188,it can not be overstated how amazing titanium is a a watch material i once had a breitling avenger seawolf which is water resistant to 3000 meter and while the diameter wa not huge it wa almost 19mm thick i wa amazed by how light it wa and also how poorly titanium conduct heat it felt almost like a heavy duty plastic
5189,is there video of you and your team playing ultimate frisbee
5190,these video are a lot more than just youtube video at this stage this production quality wipe out some modern television
5191,how anyone can sleep with a watch on is beyond me it is like wearing pant in bed
5192,too bluky
5193,a far a size is concerned you do not even have to look at sport watch look at nixon very popular fashion brand they have plenty of square and large watch
5194,how is nobody talking about his catch damnnnn
5195,i love the watch it will worn a lot more give it time big phone took some time to catch on first but now everyone love them i did not like the apple watch at first but now i want the ultra
5196,why the hell are not smart watch landscape rather than portrait
5197,2 45 shirt that masterpiece mkbhd
5198,i feel like they had to not use the word pro because it might imply to some consumer that you need the iphone pro in order to use it
5199,help poor people rather then help apple shit watch
5200,i literally can not believe people would pay 800 dollar for this apple is literally taking the piss out of you
5201,i would like them to make one that is geared towards aviator i think bose ha proven with the a20 is that aviator are willing to lay down a dollar for a bit of flight tech
5202,you could buy a very nice automatic watch that will last a lifetime a a fine piece of jewelry for dollar800 or this watch which will be e junk in 5 year
5203,they could not name it pro a lg registered the trademark watch pro day before
5204,most people do not know that the secret building that kbhd work out of is in australia
5205,1000 canadian i am good
5206,can this watch can survive in space
5207,who sutured your hand they should not have done the train track suture a hidden subcut suture would have healed with with much le scarring
5208,talk to a gun modification dude about getting black ceracoat applied strong enough for a glock strong enough for your watch
5209,that is definitely a troll for garmin
5210,0 15 nice
5211,i am desperate for a what i eat in a day
5212,apple really ha people brainwashed that their product are worth the money and markass is really leading this delusion
5213,i just wish they made smart watch that look like a watch but the most important i would love to see man watch why every apple watch have to look like lady watch and this one look like giant lady watch when it come to look i would say tag is doing the best job at the moment if this appel watch would be inside tag watch i would buy it instantly i would gladly pay dollar2000 for it but i want man smart watch
5214,the pilot precise v my favorite pen a a lefty
5215,i like how you edited the pop ups a you showed here 1 01 would love to see it become reality one day now that will be dope
5216,there wa a time when apple only had two pro item mac pro and macbook pro designed for and used by real pro today my 9 yr old neighbor is a pro too i guess
5217,hey mate the watch should look big big watch for big boy it is really interesting to see that you prefer small watch i like definitely panerei size that is why i am back to a mechanical watch i find the regular much to small and delicate really curious how that one look
5218,other high end smart watch can last for week is same a saying my landline phone doe not even require charging so it is better than apple watch how much you work you ll gain the amount for your work
5219,so the only thing holding me back from faulting the apple watch ha been the disgustingly horrendous battery life and the ultra with it improved but still absolutely terrible battery is still not nearly enough all fitbit watch easily 4 7 day and generally have superior health and fitness tracking on the higher end model to the compared to the regular apple watch at half the price my current huawei watch get about 9 12 day with all of the same feature
5220,the reason why it is name ultra because samsung watch already taken the name pro hence why apple go with ultra lol just like the phone galaxy ultra iphone pro
5221,im sorry but the battery isnt close to what garmin is bringing to the table
5222,i am actually one of the people out of the circle who apple want to bring into the ecosystem i am actually broke
5223,cmon you play catch with a frizbee not a sport
5224,a bit strange you choose to show u those other watch pretty ugly one instead of something like garmin fenix feel a bit missleading
5225,still not really an ultra watch though is it especially with mediocre battery life and no map great smartwatch though
5226,the more i look the more i want one
5227,it would be nice if they release sometime a matte black watch ultra
5228,bro that introduction wa sick
5229,69 percent battery nice
5230,that god dam meme caught me off guard at 0 08
5231,keeping the series 6 stainless steel for another year a new band watchos 9 and it is a good a new
5232,apple is g shock version
5233,marque u know that watch are supposed to be worn on the left wrist
5234,this is rich people is thing we are just here to warm our eye
5235,nice
5236,i run a lot and hike and bike and work a a certified arborist but i also have small wrist this look huge on you and i am definitely not a tall a you if they made this in two size i would jump on it the battery life is what keep me using my garmin for those 100mi ride day i will stick with my titanium aw7 and wait until they can fit this much battery in a 41mm watch thanks for the review and multiple angle of the watch
5237,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5238,could not see myself purchasing this watch but man it is a well made well thought of product
5239,maybe they left the pro title for another watch cause i feel like this really is for ultra user
5240,mkbhd there are still some people for whom the regular apple watch wa not enough and apple want those correction want their money
5241,i will just buy because it is expensive
5242,this watch is a waste of money
5243,haha you name drop met gala nice review indeed a regular watch shape may give more battery space
5244,because samsung kidnapped pro name for the watch so apple used ultra for there watch
5245,it is 1000 where i live sticking with my series 3
5246,i am sure they are going to have a pro version which is a step above the base model but lower than the ultra maybe it will have the ultra aesthetic but smaller and with more colour option
5247,nice
5248,that graphic intro though all my nerdgasms
5249,g shock version of apple watch
5250,what is the circumference of your skinny wrist for reference
5251,you got ta a really dedicated audience who just depends upon you for the review amp it is genuine can not you just start selling some tech related stuff i mean ssly you can do that amp make money
5252,cool john mayer easter egg
5253,the only thing ultra about it is taking the coined name from samsung apple is a complete joke post iphone 2007
5254,just glad that i have been waiting for apple watch all these year this is the one for me
5255,this is something i will not need ever
5256,galaxy watch gt gt gt apple
5257,the titanium series 5 i have is lovely so i think i will wait until they hopefully do a black one although we are still waiting for the airpods in anything other than white so i may be waiting a while
5258,now let is see the galaxy watch 5 pro paired with the galaxy s22 ultra for the samsung people
5259,they could give this much battery life in ultra they can give it for the same in other model is to mention they will not
5260,love the fact that you are the only one who show how it look with the black sport band that is the look i am going for
5261,nah
5262,great
5263,100m water resistance is not really that much my watch which is not even a dive watch ha 300m water resistance but i guess it the best they could do considering the fact that it ha button and a rotating crown
5264,the production quality on your content is absolutely off the hook these day
5265,no solar no buy
5266,for me i just like watch that have a big bezel size to them a i have large wrist so i wanted a bigger watch and this is it for me
5267,i think an apple watch pro might still come out le rugged with stainless steel option
5268,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5269,i just bought a series 8 i will wait till next year if the price is the same i will get one
5270,shoutout to the lego plant back there
5271,compass and backtrack are software feature and are available on my s6 with watchos 9
5272,maybe they are planning for another watch with label pro and that is why they called this the ultra
5273,that clear keyboard what is it
5274,last year i ran a half ironman and the battery died le than halfway through the race while using a series 3 yes i know it wa not the newest one out so i switched over to garmin forerunner 945 but i do miss the apple ecosystem i signed up for a full distance ironman and am racing soon i wonder if i wa to do this race if during gps mode where it track all of the stats like hr zone cadence respiration speed etc if the new apple watch could keep up with the garmin battery life i only charge my garmin maybe once a week and charge it when it get le than 20percent battery i feel it would be hard for the apple watch to keep up with garmin for ironman triathalons in term of battery life and feature what do you guy think
5275,i remember when marque wa a die hard android guy
5276,you always have amazing intro music
5277,you work out for 3 hour every day
5278,nice
5279,stick to my watch 5 pro
5280,i have the series 7 titanium 45mm watch i ordered the ultra i like titanium a i bang my apple watch on door frame and other stuff all the time plus i am getting older and use reader a lot i exercise every day and i am looking forward to the bigger brighter screen
5281,on the scuba diving it doe not have air integration that is the same thing a tank pressure monitoring which is not supported we would need new hardware in the apple watch ultra to enable that for me no air integration is the main reason i would not consider using it a a dive computer well that and the subscription required to use oceanic it would still be cool to not have to take it off while diving through
5282,the watch is battery can last for longer period of time it can handle extreme temperature water restiant comfortable on wrist and suprisingly longer than it look it make it easy for scuba diver to track live depth in the ocean the temperature of the water surrounding them it is great for mountain climber it can stay on say they knocked off or slip they can track their way back to a starting point if the they got lost it is especially in my opinion for runner and trainer it work like another stopwatch but can track your heart rate measure the amount of caloreis that you have burned after training and stay on your wrist while you run something that have i have kind of noticed is that the watch ha basic mobile apps meaning you can kind of treat it a thought it is a phone on your wrist one hundred percent worth the money for the people that regularly do these thing not really for everyday use but not bad for it either
5283,lg owns the trademark for the name watch pro so apple had to change to watch ultra
5284,my dream watch apple watch with solar charging capability i feel so lazy charging my watch everyday or every other day
5285,i absolutely dislike apple watch i bought the series 7 and gave it away after 1 month of use to my mom switched back to fitbit sense i now go at least 4 day between charge i do not care if apple make a watch that can fly me to the moon i am never going back great review though
5286,give me this
5287,is it possible to use an android phone and an apple watch
5288,it still can not compete with the true fitness watch for marathon runner and trail runner it is just not even close enough to consider honestly i think to most of u in that bucket they tried and fell short the ultra name made it seem it wa for u but then it did not do enough they just need to be better battery wise
5289,it is gon na be interesting to see how samsung responds to a comparable galaxy watch
5290,those are some nice forearm
5291,the thing that disappoints me with most modern technology now is it is short shelf life due to software you are basically buying a product to last you 5 year max when either the battery will diminish drastically or software will no longer work or both
5292,what is up with the stitch on the hard how did you manage to break that are you ok
5293,great review can not believe there is a v frisbee sport
5294,peep that lego bonsai in the back
5295,the editing in this channel is on another level prop
5296,nah
5297,garmin say hi
5298,have you heard of the whoop fitness tracker you should look into it lot of top athlete patrick mahomes rory mcilroy are using it wonder what you would think
5299,just wan na contradict something about the diving tank pressure monitoring is not just something for extreme diver it is a mandatory part of any dive you do so the fact that the watch ha these dive feature but doe not have pressure monitoring is actually very surprising and unfortunate
5300,how long doe it take to charge from 0percent to 100percent
5301,nearly dollar1000 for an apple watch which ha the same feature a a 2nd or 3rd gen samsung watch
5302,a a 6ft4 mountain of a man and the normal apple watch look to small and stupid this one will actually suit me
5303,mkbhd always get my head out of the cloud and pull me back into reality when i get too excited about a new piece of tech
5304,is it me only or can marque be a hand model
5305,you should lowkey do a giveaway of that sketch
5306,still no samsung galaxy watch 5 pro review
5307,will take casio protrek over this
5308,increased battery life on mobile tech will grab anyone is attention but if people really think about it their battery life is not a problem
5309,we also need to consider those who buy it just for the look and high end material and the sheer size the same happens with high end watch is everyone who pay 25k for a rolex submariner using the feature every single day
5310,2 and a half day battery life is not that impressive
5311,the production of marque video are just excellent this is not related to the topic but thank you for your dedication to making your subscriber such wonderful content marque
5312,i want to see these type of review a year into the usage of this watch what doe the battery time look like then are you recharging every day or did it still let you go two day
5313,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5314,i still have an apple watch 5 and can go a full day and sometimes through the night a well without charging after 3 year battery life ha barely dropped over that time
5315,1 40 same thing for samsung and their galaxy watch 5 pro they called their phone s21 22 ultra why do not they name their watch the same watch 5 ultra
5316,you can spend more on a stainless steel one with worse battery life so it is definitely worth it a larger screen a well
5317,oh no you are convincing me to plunk down macbook air money on a watch it is so useful i love to wake up with my watch tapping my arm than my phone beeping lt that is annoying i do not want to get up in a bad ish mood
5318,i would still want a rolex skydweller or submariner
5319,if you are going to have the watch on your right wrist you should switch the orientation so the crown sits on the left instead of the right so you do not hit the action button so easy
5320,the picture in your tee remind me of something lol
5321,not for no dam 800 i do not care what nobody say
5322,funny how smartwatch battery is so important but no one talk about the amazfit smsrtwatches charged my gts 3 friday with always on display and notification on today is wednesday and i am still at 47percent
5323,69percent battery nice lmao this man
5324,soo when apple doe it it revolutionary but 8 year ago in a samsung gear with a camera wa a gimmick lol
5325,i can not stress how uncomfortable that yoke look
5326,the watch being strapped almost in the middle of his forearm unsettles me so much
5327,i really hate the design everything else is cool
5328,another great review marque the only thing i would add is mention of the new applecare that includes unlimited repair for accidental damage i usually never get applecare but this new perk is too good not to pas up especially since i shattered an old apple watch while climbing and could never justify getting a new model because of this fear if i can not use it for the sport i play what is the point right
5329,can not believe how many people love watch just use your phone
5330,i wore an apple watch to the met gala we know already
5331,ultra the size of the face screen the backtrack functionality never get lost the extra mic gps speaker of course the battery to run it all most people would very much appreciate these added feature even if they are not triathletes or outdoor adventurer it also will take on a fashion statement of it own there are many video showing tiny lady guy with small wrist like you and the watch visually look like it fit normally on the wrist looking forward to jumping from my old series 3 to the ultra i say for improvement to the ultra make it even bigger with a little solar panel to the left and to the right hey you got a whole arm ya know
5332,i will get an apple watch when they have 25 day off battery
5333,69 percent battery nice ha
5334,outdoor watch with 2day battery life what a joke
5335,the biggest feature for me is not exclusive to the pro it the crash sensor ii am a testdriver driving day to day in prototype vehicle alone if i crash at night in a not very populated county i would guess it could really save my life and i am thinking of switching to it from my series 5
5336,shitpple im tired charging series7 every night give u 5 day battery life on ultra at least at those money
5337,why is there no one comparing the apple watch ultra to the galaxy watch5 pro samsung claim it to be a watch for adventurer lol
5338,the watch even look too big on mkbhd i am guessing he ha pretty big hand lol
5339,are we going to get another studio channel video of tim competing with marque stick figure
5340,ultra endurance athlete sup chillin
5341,i think you started with the wrong assumption apple is not try to get new client they want their current customer to spend more if you where from those niche and did not have an apple watch before this is not a great product this is for their customer that want a watch with more feature
5342,what an absolute beast of a watch definitely worth it the apple watch ha no competition i have a galaxy watch 4 classic and it is not even close
5343,they are not the same thing that is why
5344,i still like garmin for it battery map and load of tracking info on it app
5345,a lot of dress watch are rectangular so i always do not get this idea that the apple watch is clearly a computer on the wrist by being rectangular
5346,anyone know what that bonsai tree is in the background real fake source
5347,what would you say is the best apple product ever made for that time when it came out in other word the best upgrade from any gadget
5348,kinda hella excited to go snowboarding with this
5349,nah
5350,let be honest no professional diver will ever use an apple watch ultra is just marketing but u will see a bunch of people photo snorkeling with his apple watch ultra
5351,test these activity yourself it will be fun video
5352,i would say they did not make the ultra iwatch for people to play catch with a frisbee they did not even make it for golf or tennis they made it for a rock climber diver cave explorer open ocean swimmer marathoner
5353,marque unwinds on the weekend by burning 4 000 effing calorie what are these people how are these people why are these people
5354,anyone else concerned with the casual nature that marque change the wrist he wear the watch on throughout the day seems like serial killer behavior
5355,the reason why i have never felt like replacing my galaxy watch active 2 is because the battery marque is describing is average on my watch the idea of a watch dying every day sound awful
5356,hi
5357,apple watch ultra is attractive for me will be wearing it while binge watching tv for 16 hour at a time
5358,is this video recorded in any phone
5359,review keep saying this is designed for the extreme user marcus briefly touched on who will truly buy this watch those people who simply want a better apple watch period who doe not want 2 3 day battery life who would not love a brighter display so it is big so what i am a bigger guy and this probably will not look too out of place on me this watch will sell ton and ton for every 1 person that buy it because they are an ultra marathoner or scuba diver they will sell 99 to an average person who will never use 99percent of the ultra feature i would not be surprised if in 2 or 3 year this rugged version becomes the normal version we could see a smaller 44 or 45 mm version for smaller wrist etc stop trying to convince average user that they should buy the se because it is all they will ever need the fact appears to be that the ultra is a good watch better in every way and that is why they will sell million
5360,i have no interest in smart watch still am watching this video because of mkbhd he make it even more entertaining to watch i am fine with my mechanical watch plain boring watch it show time and date which is more than enough for me i still have not succumbed to apple ecosystem trap and will never do
5361,til there is a sport called ultimate frisbee
5362,muito top manda um pra m mano nunca te pedir nada
5363,just wait for the price drop and it is worth buying
5364,can last a week
5365,all the band i have bought since the apple watch zero have been black or go with black case i can not justify the current color if it come out in black i will buy it then apple dropped the ball not offering a black color
5366,nice review now i have to wait till november to get mine that flat display tho velcro strap are the way to go all my casios have velcro and this one will too by 3rd gen this watch will be solar thanks
5367,for that price i would still go with the garmin fenix it give you about 4 week battery life
5368,i am ultra and this is a no it is priced like ultra but feature and drawback are no
5369,i can not wait to wear this apple watch ultra on the couch watching mkbhd video
5370,where did you hear the oceanic app ha air integration i thought it did not
5371,marque for a more rigorous review should you get someone to go scuba diving hiking to actually see the usefulness of the product
5372,well spending this much money on a device that can not get it battery replaced even by apple technician
5373,subtle flex with the ultimate frisbee catch
5374,hi
5375,got massive wrist
5376,i would compare this watch to an analogue dive watch in that most people will not use the core functionality however i would say there are some good looking benefit that people could want this watch for outside of the hardcore user i e people who want the best battery life even if that is just for normal functionality to name one of many potential pull factor for normal people wanting to buy this watch
5377,nice catch number 82 john taylor would be proud of the grab
5378,2 day and night with always on display or without
5379,2003 or 04 my friend told me that he wanted the watch that could watch tv i laugh at him and 20 yr later watch could be your doctor it could be your map and so on
5380,love the intro
5381,my watch worth dollar1 5 it been a year maybe still work fine
5382,not gon na fly for real pro user until battery will be at least a week hiker want to worry last about their watch dying mid trip yes they introduced low power mode and that will be longer but with the cost of cutting off feautres so whats the point then to get 1000 watch this watch seems like very weird choice pro people will stick to their garmins maybe for diving thats fine i realy lliked the ruggedness of the watch but paying 1000 buck for feautures that i wont ever use seems stupid another thing if they would introduce rugged version of regular series 8 for le price
5383,they may release a black version of apple watch ultra later on maybe next year just like the iphone 13 pro green apple released 6 month later after iphone 13 series were released
5384,i see you are a fellow owner of a john mayer g shock very nice
5385,can the compass dual gps measure shorter distance for example 10 foot
5386,four injection of the experimental mrna an electric car and now an apple watch you good little citizen
5387,2003 or 04 my friend told me that he wanted the watch that could watch tv i laugh at him and 20 yr later watch could be your doctor it could be your map and so on
5388,i can not get over how stupid that steering wheel is
5389,watch pro coming an apple watch pro will be coming out with all the standard watch feature ultra size but the batter from the ultra no ultra feature in summary 4 watch
5390,a a doctor i can not stop seeing a sagittal cross section of the male reproductive system in your t shirt i am sorry
5391,people who are on the outside apple can not get them in because those people can not afford to buy
5392,believe it or not it doe not look big on your wrist it look fine
5393,yea if this wa cerakoted black it would perfect
5394,imo pro strict upgrade usable for the average wealthy person who can afford it ultra specialized feature that only those few would need at the cost of comfort size option
5395,the first 90 second of this video are my favorite cuz of the editing great work
5396,dollar800 seriously apple this is the reason why i will never buy one of your stupid product again i am sticking with my iphone 8
5397,the video becoming a bit comedic is the only huge takeaway for me keep it up
5398,jerry will have the last word on actual durability and how real the sapphire is of course haha but after watching the review and people is comment now is clearer than ever that the market for this watch is basically everyone but polar is garmin is which were the company everybody saw dying suddenly after the ultra is release it is a nice addition to the market but the bulk of that market will be people wanting an apple watch with decent battery life because the average smartwatch ha horrendous battery and that is ok
5399,bhai airpods pro 2 ke daal de review
5400,the vfx guy on this channel is lit
5401,i just want the battery life because i hate charging my battery everyday
5402,hey marque can you also do review of galaxy watch 5 pro
5403,why there is no video on galaxy watch 5 5 pro waiting for that review from you
5404,boom john mayer x hodinkee gshock outta nowhere
5405,honestly until you can get 7days on a charge the apple watch just is not worth it it is another thing you have to worry about charging or forgetting to charge
5406,how the hell do you have the ultra it is not even available yet
5407,i would buy one if the price where a little bit better in the eu euros1000 is just too much euros800 is okay
5408,they went out of their way to make a new apple watch and for the price it ha never been more of a joke because for the price there are hundred of far superior option
5409,i like that casey neistat type storytelling
5410,no smart watch is worth 800 plus dollar hell nooooooooooooooo
5411,overpriced and unnecessary garbage i have a good old timex that is well over 20 year old and doe not miss a beat
5412,i have had iphones for 12 year and their compass ha never worked for me it always point backwards when i am using google navigation
5413,not only do your wrist need to be big enough your pocket need to be deep too
5414,ultra is for samsung owner not apole
5415,garmin watch are the best in the market longest battery precision at affordable price check them out i have been using a fenix 6x pro last half a month no problem
5416,hey marque wa this shot by the insta360 x3 the 1st person video thing you were talking about in previous video
5417,those intro animation left me drueling
5418,the freaking intro bro so fire
5419,never met swimmer runner or cyclist who used apple watch and you will never do so leave those guy out of the second circle forever
5420,this watch is more than for sport folk it is perfect for me a my job is very manual and dirty i need a hardy watch and apple watch do not cut it until this one
5421,i can come up with nearly any number of us excuse for buying this but i do not have dollar800 lying around after i bought the 14 pro i also feel certain there will be some new feature for the aw9 ultra about a year from now i like the serious hiker excuse we all know how they drag usb battery around with a bag of cable for all their gadget and the special wax and bone comb for the beard or not
5422,victor novorski that is a good one
5423,my mi band 4 doe the same thing and last longer
5424,what happened to u we are praising 3 day of a watch battery when we used to have watch that take year before we change the battery
5425,imo the largest market for this watch is current apple watch owner who love their watch but want something new that is bigger and better of course they might convert some athlete from specialized device to apple watch ultra but i would guess that will be in the low single digit percentage of overall sale i ski hike mountain bike swim commute by bike walk my dog and workout at home i love my current apple watch but can not wait for this next iteration
5426,apple can make regular apple watch with bigger battery and flat display but they will not because all they want is your hard earned money
5427,i am gon na stick to my analogue watch that never need recharging i am already charging 50 other gadget i feel like i am gon na die among charger and wire
5428,marque is left handed
5429,the production value of their video always stuns me
5430,i own an aw s4 and an older garmin and i am in the market for a new sport watch to replace at least the garmin i would never buy the ultra it is simply too much of a compromise on battery life the ultra delivers the same battery life in power save mode a similarly priced competitor do in high accuracy gps tracking it also relies too heavily on touch input which is garbage in anything other than sunny cali
5431,no air integration 8 51
5432,that wa a sick intro
5433,i hate when people say calorie when they mean kilocalorie but apple literally putting it on their watch like that is so wrong it off by a factor of 1000
5434,ya also forget the paranoid market i will admit it interest me cuz the better gps i got health issue so i would like the fall detection and knowin it ha better gpa especially since past gps could have issue with building ya def make me want a ultra
5435,i love the watch but like samsungs pro not the price my now 2yr old dollar100 refurbished amazon gear s3 frontier ha been great for me i love the larger type watch amp i wear mine in saltwater while fishing the texas coast amp not a single issue i still get 2 day battery but i just put it on charge at night when i go to bed can not beat a dollar100 refurbished gear s3
5436,i love the aesthetic of this watch but i have no use for it
5437,and fukin dollar800 the same thing my mi band 4 doe it for only dollar20
5438,i would rather just not wear a watch i just wan na know the time in general all watch feel weird to wear
5439,let adam review this watch please
5440,not to mention my skinny asian wrist
5441,hey marque what happened to your hand did you insure yourself
5442,forget the watch for a second let talk about his jacked forearm
5443,wow they managed to shrink the ridiculously large packaging that the 8 and se still come in
5444,dollar799
5445,i know apple product is for rich people but still want to know and understand why people want to buy a watch for 800 dollar yes i know people buy rolex or armani or other brand but they are made of gold or other thing but still never understand what it is that make people fall for same thing again and again they literally launched last year is phone this year calling it new iphone apple really got some loyal fan base literally
5446,i go snowboarding during winter backcountry sometimes and mountain biking during summer this watch is a perfect fit for me the original watch is just not suitable for some extreme condition
5447,that intro way better than some apple ad
5448,i like garmin watch better coros pace 2 is great too
5449,one thing is missing orange strip
5450,this should be the normal apple watch but count
5451,reminds me of a pip boy
5452,one of the biggest reason i would get this over the garmin fenix 7 is how well integrated it is to my iphone woud be cool to have one watch for mountain biking hiking and diving
5453,were you also using always on display when you got 2 5 day out of it thanks
5454,most of the do not need it but alot of people will buy it
5455,you might laugh at what i am saying now but literally everyone older than 50 or so really appreciate the bigger screen that is the only reason i got the iphone 13 pro max combined with all the other feature these watch help enormously older folk i am 55 and eye sight is deteriorating and glass have become very important y all will get there so do not underestimate this great video a usual
5456,this is way smaller and cheaper than my garmin watch i love the way it look and although my garmin epix 2 with oled display can last a full week even with heavy use i really like the look of this watch and the fact that it will complement the rest of the apple ecosystem
5457,why doe the watch jump from your left arm to your right one is that feature jk
5458,these with a month battery life they are not computer let is be honest here you kinda comparing old dump nokia to smartphone battery life
5459,hi mkbhd can you gift me the apple watch ultra please coz i can not afford
5460,ngl that thing is pretty ugly i do not really see a use case for this the average consumer definitely shouldnt get this one but i do not see why an porofessional should get this either the only possible person i think can buy this are people who love gimmiks and or at least want to look like they do some extreme stuff but once you for example go hiking for more then 2 day your battery is empty when you climb some hill the watchwill still get great scratch apple doesnt want you to use screen protector sooo sorry for my bad english but still in my opinion there is no actual use for it maybe actually just people want to show off that they can afford the most expensive apple stuff
5461,oh i only wear smart watch not those dumb watch
5462,if apple really wanted this watch to live up to the name ultra why did not they put a solar powered battery in it designer watch like citizen and movado use solar power battery why not an apple watch apple is all about protecting the environment and at least this way they can remove another item from the box
5463,i think the apple watch will be a compulsary electronic device in the near future think about these apple glass will be released in 5 year and it is gon na be substitute phone but by the apple glass it can not take a selfie if apple watch have under display camera people can take a selfie by apple watch the size will be bigger than current watch series because battery and physical limitation just a the iphone series wa initially adapted to being larger than 4 inch to 6 inch it will also adapt to the larger watch apple glass itself may not be able to completely replace the phone but i think it will be possible to completely replace it with the help of the apple watch starting with the apple watch ultra more and more function are introduced and i am sure that the apple watch will invade the iphone is territory it is expected that apple glass will be used to consume content such a video viewing social medium and game and the apple watch will be a way to compensate for the shortcoming caused by the physical limitation of glass maybe my expectation are wrong and all function can be integrated with just one apple glass
5464,crapple suck
5465,cornelius would be proud
5466,dollar800 nah
5467,69percent battery nice
5468,im waiting for it to arrive in november i would say that the battery is the main reason i bought it and oh man i wished it wa in black
5469,cycling
5470,in uk the iphone 13 is gbp749 brand new at apple and the iwatch ultra is gbp849
5471,sup
5472,it can never touch even the garmin sq 2 for battery life and everything
5473,you need to understand a difference between a watch that is only for health and fitness and a watch that can pretty much do everything
5474,i work in a storage place and it could be good for me it is a shame in my country that would be like 1200dollar dollar
5475,i am so tempted to get the ultra simply because of the time between charging needed while still delivering from what i have seen some of the best biometrics data so far that it is supposedly much more durable doe not hurt either i will certainly not go do extreme sporting or 300km hike but still just from that could be worth the diff then again i honestly do not need a smart watch but i do want one
5476,dollar800 for still no google browser no youtube support can not even listen to youtube music without an apple phone nearby can not open discord can only respond to message via notification otherwise you can not open an app to respond the device overall feel very limited for what seems like simple functionality to have on such an expensive device if you want to charge nearly phone price for the apple watch then give me these basic feature to justify such a hefty price i would have loved to see a front facing camera for face recognition i will stick with my series 8 until you actually make significan not change
5477,wonder why they did not made them landscape it would be good even on skinny wrist
5478,is this whole video wa shot on iphone 14 pro
5479,69percent nice
5480,voice by 20syl is the best proved
5481,that intro wa so coooool i love the glowing icon following your wrist a it turn
5482,watch should be worn on the left hand
5483,depends on preference what is your point
5484,why are blushing at the end wa it presented by your secret girlfriend
5485,a much a i like everything i hear about this i wish there an independent 3rd party to test all the thing apple is claiming
5486,doesnt lg hold the trademark for exploitation of the term watch pro in the consumer electronics space i thought that wa why apple went with a different name
5487,did you notice the watch showing any scratch cosmetic damage at all during the two day of use and while practicing
5488,that battery life sound like my galaxy watch 4 classic battery life
5489,production quality is immaculate a always
5490,awesome review marque thanks im sold
5491,can not wait to go ultra in a couple day i get mine on 9 23 22 i do not scuba dive but i do like to swim a lot so i am really looking forward to the depth and water temp gauge i am going to use this while i am racing and riding dirtbikes i think it will be really useful for the long trail ride i would love to see them make a motocross app lap time g force air time over the jump thanks for the great and honest review
5492,this will not be adopted by serious cyclist and triathletes without the ability to pair a power meter
5493,it is a nice watch for everyday and for extreme activity but from a scuba diver point of view 2 drawback 1 the lack of trimix gas integration is unexplainable a this is just a software calculation method and apple could have done it 2 oceanic app will be free for a period of time then it will be a paid subscription for me personally i am happy with my garmin descent mk2i but got ta give apple credit for involving other activity and entering these territory
5494,this watch is kinda like jeep in america total overkill for regular city driving but you see them on the street all the time
5495,what is the exit song on this video
5496,banda by jordan edmonds
5497,you can shazam it
5498,why casio watch is compared for battery life with apple watch it is not a fair comparison
5499,i wa not even planning on purchasing an apple watch this year because my series 6 is still going strong after two year but they announced the apple watch ultra i ordered one and it should be here early october because it is on backorder i can wait
5500,what do you think about the new orange band
5501,bro you have straight up been king of the review game since like 2013 big prop homie
5502,great vid a usual i felt left out a a electrician stick figure i broke the screen on my last watch and have never replaced it i feel it wa a side impact a the screen broke right around the edge this rugged watch with way more feature then i need would suit my lifestyle way better i feel there is a market for a simpler ultra apple watch it will probably come out next year
5503,can you make a smaller ultra of 47mm made of aluminum cellular with the same battery for 699 you can call it apple watch max and you can take my money also
5504,god damn
5505,samsung took the pro name on gw5 so it is common that apple use ultra name
5506,wa that hand drawn explanation in honor of casey is return to nyc
5507,i do not even need all of the functionality of the basic apple watch i just like how it look
5508,garmin make better sport watch than any other manufacturer
5509,i like making and receiving phone call from my watch so better speaker are a selling point for me
5510,2022 when every youtuber come up with better more coherent name for apple is messed up product line and name
5511,a moment of silence to u who are seeing dope tech without a penny in our pocket so far
5512,tell me what it doe first ffs feature are forgotten
5513,the main reason i want this apple watch ultra and never got a reg one is because of the battery and the size i am a big guy and the reg apple watch looked like a kid watch on me so i hated it can not wait to go size it at apple store
5514,that watch is not on your wrist it is on your arm
5515,i think the watch ultra 2 may have the promotion display
5516,for diver i think apple watch ultra is closest competitor is garmin descent mk2
5517,there might be an apple watch pro and it might be aimed towards the working class professional while the ultra watch target the athlete
5518,a someone who doe like to track a number of metric for running and cycling i had a garmin fenix way before an apple watch i still prefer it for run and cycling not in the least because of battery life on the apple watch once any sort of continued measuring is going on i also sometimes go diving price wise a diving computer my fenix and the watch which i prefer for body metric and integration with my other apple product easily come out at 1200 buck i am not yet convinced because especially the sensor integration with cycling with my garmin is so seamless but if i can find a good solution to keep track of that looking at you apple for proper triathlon use i may be one of those people who would buy one of these i may do so regardless if one of my other option dy on me
5519,saw 4 poco ad along with this review unskipable
5520,me thinking during the intro i had a casio watch that wa solar did not ever need to charge it and if it wa ever running low once in an area with sunlight it would just turn on i hope there is a solar smart watch eventually
5521,omg it is an apple ipad mini mini on the wrist it is beefy on both your left and right wrist can not imagine what it look like on a smaller woman is wrist
5522,give it a year and soon you will see every stay at home mom with this watch you undermine consumeristic suburban america is ability to buy something just because it is the most expensive one
5523,give it a year and soon you will see every stay at home mom with this watch you undermine consumeristic suburban america is ability to buy something just because it is the most expensive one
5524,i prefer the ultra naming scheme pro professional you do not need to be a professional to use the added feature of the airpods pro or the iphone pro whereas the pro xdr display and pro mac option are built for professional use i think apple should migrate consumer level high end product line to the ultra moniker ultra sound premium and will draw enthusiast without muddying the definition of the word pro
5525,ugly watch i prefer a basic casio digital watch it ha an always on display and a 10 year battery even ha a backlight and best of all it tell the time whenever without pressing button
5526,next apple watch will be used to study blackholes
5527,apple amp bmw love using the word pro
5528,this is laughable
5529,the iripoff ha arrived lot of feature but definitely not worth it specially since apple will replace it or it time it will fail and if it get damaged good luck repair it if you know you know
5530,i want to get it but a real diving watch or a real heavy duty watch are built much more tailored to their intention i love the higher battery life though yet for field use i would probably still have a case over it
5531,man if they really want the diver crowd they need to get 200 300m water resistance and a corresponding iso rating if not 40 m is not helium diving people
5532,regardless of the heart rate sensor on the watch i have yet to have an apple watch that get it consistently maybe being darker skinned or something so i pair mine with a stand alone heart rate monitor polar h10 and now i can see my heart rate during a workout a it spike up and come down between set or sprint this is much preferred over seeing it stuck at trying to read and the last it got wa during warmup at like 80 90bpm
5533,apple watch ultra it morphing time
5534,dollar800 is chicken change when you have the right skill
5535,i spend day at a time in the mountain and the apple watch ha always been so disappointing in it is potential for mapping navigation safety comms etc hamstrung by dismal battery life and apple functionality gatekeeping this definitely ha my attention but i am still unconvinced i will probably keep using my phone for the bulk of those need paired to my garmin spot inreach for satellite messaging
5536,why markass ha a low energy in this video
5537,gt 99percent of user will need lt 10percent of it feature but will need 100percent of the status
5538,what about the galaxy watch 5 pro
5539,dumb question maybe but why doe not apple use some kind of charging technology that us the natural body heat to charge
5540,but the watch look ultra ugly
5541,i do not know who noticed but his watch is wrist change in every shot
5542,can you do a review of samsung is watch
5543,sick intro
5544,we definitely need more mkbhd artwork in review video
5545,is not for you just for ultra frisbee player ultimate frisbee is not enough
5546,that t shirt once you see it you can not un see it
5547,npc title
5548,also those who ha more money will buy it
5549,the waypoint is easily the best feature imo immense utility value
5550,hey marque have you turned the cellular network on during the test thanks
5551,i believe apple decided on the name ultra because ultra refers to the specific category of extreme sport ultra endurance ultra marathon etc
5552,i would love to see this watch in person because i only see people with skinny wrist reviewing it lol also you can not compare tech watch to a regular watch with solar charging ability it is not fair and they both differ in what they can do
5553,anyone think that this could possible be targeted toward athlete and military personal i can think of a lot of military application in which it would be helpful to collect the data it is collecting on top of collecting the data it need in specialized circumstance i am sure apple could build in some way of reporting this data to some centralized system making it easier to monitor the location health etc of a military is soldier also it is still an apple watch so it can bring all of the benefit of more specialized piece of equipment while also being a general communication tool i genuinely do not know anything about the military so i do not know if this is realistic i am curious to know if other people think this is possible or not
5554,i just want the latest and greatest because i can thats all lol
5555,1 40 bcoz they are coming with ultra pro 1600dollar
5556,smartwatches sadly still have some degree of compromise you can actually buy a smartwatch with a replaceable cell battery that last for an entire year but the catch is that the watch is a hybrid smartwatch and hybrid smartwatches prioritise being a watch over being a smart device ironically the first ever smartphone that paired to a phone wa actually a hybrid smartwatch the sony ericsson mbw 100 this watch wa a mechanical watch with an led display at the bottom for notification and music and had playback control on the side and incredibly there are still watch that follow similar principle the most modern one i have seen use e ink display a the watch face with hand that will move out of the way whenever you get a notification or navigate through certain menu and setting one of the popular example of a watch with this setup being fossil is hybrid hr watch these however do not have replaceable battery but do have rechargeable battery that only need recharging once every 2 week but another type is a hybrid watch that ha no display at all and will instead point to a number on the dial that you can assign to notification relating to an app or a contact personally i have not had a good experience with fossil is version of these watch on android i had syncing issue and on io it would only accept notification from apps that fossil had personally whitelisted no idea why especially since their hybrid hr watch support all apps but that is how it is but there are other company that make these including none other than armani these watch look like normal watch and do not use much power which is how they are able to keep going for an entire year or more but yeah i have not seen a single hybrid that support third party application and sadly they are rather underrated a watch sure they are more minimalist when it get to functionality but they do have a kind of secret agent spy watch kind of quality to them that i think make them stand out
5557,i do triathlon and diving but i will not be getting this for everyday use i might however get it for those activity to be able to track both i would normally need both a sport watch for 400 500 and a dive computer for a much now i can get both in one and it will also go into my apple activity tracking and so it becomes a watch to wear on race day or dive day rather than just for the activity and then i will keep the s5 for my daily use where the ultra look too out of place i think for endurance athlete and diver it is not necessarily a daily driver but rather a better and sleeker alternative to the sport dive watch
5558,let be real the appeal of this watch is the flex 99percent of buyer will not go diving or climb mountain or whatever else wa in the presentation they will get it because it is the expensive one a usual
5559,drawing on marque analogy apple is expanding from the inside out that is they take their standard watch and basically double it is capability but at the end the ultra is still very much tied to it original apple watch gene in contrast company like garmin coros suunto go from the outside in they concentrate first on giving athlete the most useful feature long battery gps heart rate o2 sat training zone sleep tracking etc and truly excel at those metric then they toss in a few of the most useful connectivity feature like call text notification so the main question becomes what role you want your smartwatch to play in your life or training if you want your watch to be an active extension clone of your phone then the apple watch and the new ultra make sense if you want the best athletic computer to guide your workout while not missing important text or phone call then garmin coros suunto have you covered
5560,nobody mkbhd at 69percent battery noice
5561,i am an old guy who like to ride bike and i am a tech geek last summer i rode from istanbul to barcelona my stainless series 3 could not be used on the ride because the battery did not last using strava but i hate wearing a chest hrm i just wish the ultra would broadcast heart rate to my iphone or my wahoo computer i do have one of these on order it is time pun intended
5562,titanium can be anodized but the best type of ano us electrode additionally ano doe scratch after time a it is only a surface ano
5563,excited for my delivery on friday this will be my first apple watch been wearing g shock mudmasters and garmins exclusively for the last 8 year during my time in the military and off duty i work in real estate now so i am looking forward to finally being able to answer call on my wrist while also being able to comfortably bring it out to the wood on my bow hunt and to the mountain on my ski trip without worry that it will shatter or lose battery during the day i really think this will be perfect for my lifestyle
5564,this watch make sense for like 2percent of the population but it will still sell like crazy introverted office nerd all over the world with this thing for no reason
5565,not sure about office people not into sport buying this but i guess we will see lol
5566,calling it now apple is saving the term pro for another enthusiast amalgamation device and it will probably exclusive ise the stainless steel case
5567,wait holdup he put his watch on his right hand
5568,i know they are not in the same market bracket but a a long time amazfit user it make me chuckle when people are shocked they get more than a day out of their watch i still have basically all feature 98percent of anyone buying this will ever use but charging more than once a week is not a thing even with always on display active i can not fathom why people accept le than a day battery on stuff
5569,mkbhd video always have this professional feel to them other tech youtubers even one i like such a ltt feel mass produced but each of mkbhd and the studio video feel focused and like they have an extremely high production value anytime i click on a video from this team i know i am always going to get an enjoyable visually appealing video with little to no bias towards a product i love ltt but it is clear linus ha some bias towards certain brand marque never give off that vibe and it absolutely make the video more enjoyable i do not feel like i am being told that i need to buy the product he is showcasing
5570,the biggest reason i will not get this watch is because i find the data recording a bit lacking garmin ha garmin connect where you can go in and look at your metric and really analyze your workout a far a i know from using my apple watch i can not look at the workout metric in depth i can not even see a decent size graph of my heart rate while i wa exercising i have to use my phone thats annoying
5571,oh wow if it is not forbes 18 top creator of 2022 marque brownlee
5572,to know you have a regular weekend like many other dedicated athlete is refreshing
5573,the little people drawing is top notch lol
5574,i am a watch guy and have always wanted to like the apple watch but never felt the pull to get one this is the first one where i said i need to get this
5575,pro mean u ritch
5576,i read they could not call it the apple watch pro because some other company like lg or somebody ha the copyright to watch pro already
5577,putting a protective case on this will make it massive considering the price of this a case is a necessary evil
5578,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5579,naw that is what apple care is for never bothered with a case
5580,apple watch series 8 review also coming right
5581,cool scar dude
5582,nah
5583,how about sleeping with this block of titanium
5584,something about this watch make me me feel like we are getting closer and closer to pip boy
5585,thanks
5586,went to sleep with 69 percent battery nice
5587,if they gave u a darker color i would have been sold
5588,i will say this with just about any apple product except for the macbook sideload apps or bust
5589,the r amp d ha been done for the extreme user which will buy this meanwhile apple creates the desire and want for non extreme user thereby leaving room for watch pro in future
5590,the word apple and worth it should never be combined
5591,i mean if you guy want longer battery hour then just get amazfit fitbit they have a version where you do not need to charge for more than 40 day other than that i think apple did a good one on this
5592,it is a little disingenuous that marque did not mention you should not buy this watch for the dive app until it is out buy it for what it is right now remember why not the same for apple
5593,honestly having a garmin fenix i would pas on this for a lot of reason it just is not the right kind of watch for outdoor adventure especially with only a 2 day battery life v garmin is 9 it doe not do anything extra that the fenix doe not
5594,i am gon na buy it but i will only use it for my hike in my normal day to day i can choose between my current 3 watch
5595,that yoke is just so silly
5596,it is the red bull marketing approach getting the extreme guy to vouch for it trickle aspiration among the general population even if they do not need it
5597,i swear before he mentioned what is a pro airpods user i started thinking what music professional would ever produce music through their airpods
5598,definitely want one but i just can not see myself switching from this to my series 6 for different occasion i wish it had more color option
5599,i would really be interested in an in depth view of the gps tracking location for hiking hunting i use onx on my phone and they do not have a smart watch application but if this could provide insight on say where i have been and walked pinning location etc i would think about getting this
5600,i honestly can not be bothered with a watch that only last a couple of day on a single charge if i wa an athlete or a diver or something i would have considered it but i do not need these feature they are more of a luxury for me i am not willing to sacrifice battery life for them there are dumber chinese smart watch that can last week or a month with much smaller battery i would rather go with that plus they are literally a fraction of the price like around 1 16th of the price lol
5601,hello sir why do not you ever tell your fan about your scar on the back of your hand do not you think that would make them feel more connected to you
5602,easily one of your best video now if you could only convince my mother and her doctor why she would benefit from having an apple watch that would be something
5603,great video but that ultra watch look way too big on your wrist definitely not styling
5604,why are the intro always over the top
5605,airpods pro 2 when
5606,any reason for not using the orange band
5607,galaxy watch 4 baby i do construction and it is amazing i get 2 day on it always on display google ect 800bucks is way too much
5608,it is about the flex the all important flex
5609,we get it you went to the met gala how many more time do you need to humble brag that story
5610,best apple watch they have ever made is the exact reason everyone will get it we do not use half the feature in our apple watch already but we still got it lol
5611,i disagree it is not just for functionality on my 18th birthday i received my first branded product from my mother an dollar800 armani watch i would say that this apple watch ultra is a lot more worth it i think for people that buy branded watch they can easily look at an apple watch and want to buy the most expensive decked out version because watch are not just a tech product it is a wearable luxury item
5612,damn i suppose it is time to update the 7 series video on my channel
5613,marque i thought a different company already officially bought the watch pro name and thus the use of ultra i could be wrong
5614,it is not worth it if you are a fitness freak you should be getting a garmin fenix for someone who is not a hardcore user watch se is the one to go can you use garmin for a week long track yes you can but apple watch you can not
5615,nah i will stay with my garmin 955 still beat the ultra on battery still beat the ultra on connecting to cycling and running device with ant still beat it for all the athletic metric i do
5616,800 for a watch no thanks
5617,honestly the fact that i can operate a a dive computer is pretty impressive i however am concerend sbout operating a touchscreendevice underwater but if it work a normal watch sized dive computer can cost well north of usdollar1000 so it is literally cheaper and you can use it a a normal watch all the time and it is probably actually smaller yes that is a total niche and no i will not be getting one because this watch is too bulky for me for normal use but that is 100percent a win for anyone who dive regularly
5618,this watch is huge and still ha such a weak battery garmin last for week without physical activity and much smaller that hideous thing
5619,where are you getting these dope animation in your intro
5620,i have a garmin smartwatch easily get 3 week of use out of one charge i am considering getting the apple watch but i do not want need the ultra why can not they make a standard apple watch with a larger battery because neither the standard nor the ultras battery life is impressive the ultras battery life should be the bare minimum for smart watch nowadays
5621,apple got me with the hiking and gps i live offgrid run a nonprofit for disabled veteran guiding backpack trek hunting and fishing trip throughout the year in the mountain of colorado and the ultra finally ha me willing to try a smartwatch of course i am waiting until nov for the one i ordered to be shipped and hunting season will almost be over this year so snow hike and snowboarding at first
5622,just get a garmin
5623,it is giving omnitrix
5624,i wish you demonstrated the watch wearing on left hand a well it make sense since 99percent people wear watch in left hand
5625,i think the seller for me is the longevity i am still rocking a series 3 and the batter life ha diminished but it is certainly not unusable now this with it battery life and ruggedness i feel like it will last me a lifetime that is it for me longevity
5626,he is but if you keep your eye open you can snag series 6 and series 7 bargain from a new resellers ie in u k i just bought a 44mm red cellular 6 opened not used from curry is with an ebay 20percentvoucher for gbp220 from a series 3 to a series 6 would be ground breaking for you and at a fraction of the price depends if you can stomach the gbp849 cost but worth looking at although i can not blame you for getting the ultra a it doe look so good
5627,nice linus would be proud
5628,0 51 it is crazy how that is impressive for an apple watch i have a huawei watch that last for like two week on android lol
5629,but it is huwawei
5630,thanks for the video marcus i will be buying that casio solar watch you mentioned
5631,amazing video quality production bro keep up the good work
5632,69percent battery
5633,i would have liked it in a bright silver stainless steel im going to wait until next year if i know apple different color will come next year
5634,nothing apple is worth
5635,how many scuba diver even exist
5636,pro just mean more money for apple
5637,it left one group of people broke gang
5638,you think they named it ultra to screw over samsung if they do a pro version of their watch cause when i hear ultra i think samsung lol
5639,wr100 is not actually 100m deep water resistant
5640,i do not know why i am watching this although i will not be able to buy any newly launched iphone or apple watch
5641,90percent of the thing this guy talk is of no use important info get fade away with his shitty useless info wasted my 15 minute
5642,i wonder if the siren feature can be used to scare animal away in the wilderness such a bear or mountain lion just asking
5643,woke up with 69percent battery nice
5644,dollar800 for a smart watch is never worth that much
5645,great review marque
5646,this one might last through a two day ultimate tournament too masculine for me though
5647,13 06 is an insane catch
5648,thanks for your analyse
5649,when when when is apple going to allow me to play music with my watch with the sound coming out of my watch dollar800 and i can not even play music and the sound come straight out of my watch speaker i am a runner so this would benefit me
5650,is this watch a reason for me to switch from android to iphone
5651,your review look like commercial i do not know if that is a good thing or not but i am sure apple love it
5652,i am worried about my humor that i laughed out loud in the middle of nowhere lmao i do not why and if it is actually the humor right there great job marque
5653,who built the lego bonsai tree
5654,now try to wear a garmin fenix 7x solar or epic 2 to really blow your lind on battery life
5655,this thing is about the red watch face for the rest the band is cheap and it look not to good like you are father bought a zenwatch or apple watch and went to the local home and depot store and bought a house drilling machine with bt thats the reason you can not find it in black that is for geek and also not allowed in the over 500 watch piece
5656,i am a free diver surfer the only reason why i have not bought a apple watch yet is because i did not really trust to submerge it in water however now that they made one that can sustain 100m i am buying one in the near future once more review come out
5657,a a runner who is into marathon amp spartan race this is my thing i think i will wait till their second ultra to come out i hope their will be a smaller size
5658,they look like they were made for construction worker this orange button and orange wrist band will be good with orange protective helmet and waistcoat
5659,garmin doe it for cheaper and a more functional screen and better battery it a nah
5660,amazing video dudde a always prop
5661,why do you wear the watch on your right wrist my guess is that your left handed
5662,i am still rocking the series 3 but ordered the ultra i do a lot of night time timelapse is and photography so the night mode and way point will be extremely helpful hope it do not look redic on my small wrist
5663,oh my god 800 dollar watch doe not even come with a band
5664,my 2 year old galaxy watch last 4 day on a single charge and auto track workout for le than half the price
5665,how big is your wrist it would help u judge how it would fit on our own wrist
5666,wan na be pro
5667,not the normal beaten path casuals finding popular hike on google
5668,a a garmin fenix owner i passed on the apple watch would have been back around the series 2 originally due to the unimpressive water proof tech and gps battery life if my garmin ever need replaced the apple watch ultra will finally be a contender rather than just buying the latest garmin fenix
5669,i am none of those outskirt people i am getting it because i have a big wrist and big hand the fact that it is premium material and included cellular make it a better deal anyways
5670,what is the pen that he is using at 2 19 called
5671,my watch doe all of that for 21 dollar
5672,there is absolutely no way you are burning 1 8k calorie in 3 hour something is definitely wrong here that is equal to swimming straight without pause for the same time
5673,they should add a flashlight honestly
5674,definitely a great evolution for the apple watch but i wonder if the upgraded feature are truly enough for the hardcore adventurer for example 100m water resistance will take you deeper but is that a static 100m most true dive watch are rated for 200 300m because when you are moving the watch around under water you put a lot more pressure on the seal and entry point than just having it sit there 99 99percent of diver will not go to 200m but that is not what the rating actually mean also for those who are doing multi day hike in the backcounty the extra battery life is great but when you are constantly running gps to track your mileage and route compass etc that battery life i am sure is much lower than the rating so it is great for maybe 1 2 full day of hiking but what about multi day excursion i doubt it would last for a 2 3 day backpacking trip with all the function running it is definitely a good step for the casual outdoors person but for my more hardcore outing i will stick with my garmin fenix and i do use an apple watch for everyday work around home purpose it is a much better smartwatch but it is not purpose built the way garmin etc are
5675,how did you get that scar on your hand
5676,look to me like a trial at the new template for the next everyday apple watch
5677,the whole time you had theater mode on i would not call this a real world battery test with that in mind
5678,not trying to contradict anything presented in this video but there is a lot of people who lust after a rugged tech packed feature rich piece of equipment like the ford bronco raptor every guy with a pulse surely want one it is not just the extreme fringe of the off roading crowd that want one a person doe not want something because he is able to use all of it feature he want it to be and look and feel cool and that doe not necessarily make someone a poser we all want to look good while we are out and about a real off roader though doe not buy a 100 000dollar truck to go off road he just us his wife is 1980 isuzu trooper just like real mountain men are not using an apple watch ultra they more than likely have never heard of them they just use a 20dollar walmart watch and a lifetime of genuine survival skill
5679,can not wait to get mine
5680,apple tried to find a reason for you to use it joke on them i do not use apple product because of apple
5681,a soon a the apple watch can go a week on one charge i will buy it
5682,that will happen soon apparently the apple watch ultra last 36 hour with normal use and 60 hour on low power mode which is 2 5 day with the new feature that apple is adding to the apple watch which supposedly increase battery life by 3x it will last for around 7 5 day on low power mode and 4 5 with normal use
5683,haha whoever is stupid enough to spend 800 for this is watch is an apple schill
5684,i am weird but mk is wrist in this part is just so clear with the bokeh in the background 6 30 not a fetish i just get mesmerized by random thing i see
5685,yeah the camera that wa used in that shot is amazing it is probably the best quality video shot i have seen in a while better then most movie shot in term of quality
5686,did anyone else notice how the glow of the icon extended and lit up his wrist around the watch crazy detail look awesome
5687,look cool but i am afraid id be running marathon and doing extreme hike after a while i have pretty skinny wrist though so not sure how it would look maybe a future gen will be more appealing
5688,did the sleep stage work correctly
5689,none of them are worth it i have had so many smart watch they all are a waste of time and really just add another thing you need to charge and worry about i replaced them all with a high quality regular real traditional watch guess what i do not need to charge it and screen on time is infinite
5690,get a real watch mine an automatic and work for a lifetime it also ha a few dozen jewel
5691,when will you be reviewing new sony m5 headphone
5692,bruhvthis whole video is just fiih those graphic
5693,where did you get those watch band i could not find any 49 mm watch band
5694,can not wait for the airpods review
5695,that battery life for an apple watch is crazy hope next year the regular ha similar improvments
5696,i am saving to buy this watch and i have been waiting for your review love your video intro
5697,got ta say most of the new feature i am not going to use and i am not a fan of the thick frame so i think i am just gon na get the larger version of last year version a i have the 40mm
5698,i wonder how doe this compare to a sport watch like garmin or coros
5699,i do not like the way apple treat it is customer they have a good product tho
5700,1 28 apple wa not able to name it apple watch pro because lg electronics already bought the right for watch pro before apple could do
5701,next year for sure iphone 15 ultra
5702,g g
5703,another excellent video thanks for the deep dive pun intended i guess into the ultra i did pre order one and this wa is helpful in better understanding it is capability though i like it is design and will be actually effecting to dress it up
5704,i am 5 ft 7 with tiny wrist i do not really do extreme sport and never owned an apple watch planning to get this year but i am in dilemma after watching the ultra is review look good with great feature which i might not even be using but it is so huge it is yet to land in malaysia and once it doe my misery start
5705,apple almost made me shift and buy all their ecosystem thank god there is no blood pressure there otherwise will leave all my other android stuff and completely shift to apple almost bought the iphone 14 pro and ultra watch lol till that day come
5706,500k view in an hour this is the guy impressive
5707,if they took the bulging side out and found a way to taper it or just made it 47mm and then made it black i would get it it would be a nice upgrade from my 5 and would save me dollar400 on a dive computer
5708,should have called it the apple watch bulk
5709,it sample samsung and apple swap there watch name pro and ultra lol
5710,they know how to name there product and mostly they are off the chart employee and your a youtuber big difference
5711,imagine an apple watch ultra pro
5712,that will be coming out in march
5713,would not the theater mode have affected battery life since it would not turn on the display when you raise your watch until you touch it
5714,scuba diver here and had been waiting for this watch for a long time not disappointing diving will requiere a monthly subscription for basic diving computer function and apple may not backup in warranty diving which would be ridiculous for a dive computer watch another iwatch release and once again will not be purchasing
5715,so i think the ultra would apply to athlete categorize themselves a age grouper these people are enthusiast in their sport and may do multiple event but have to balance their training with everyday life job family etc these people will use the extra benefit from the ultra but still want the connectivity of the apple ecosystem being able to do different workout during the day while also having a device that keep you connected is great while this population group is small compared to the population of all people this is actually the majority of people who do these sort of activity not every triathlete need or care about the full benefit of a high end garmin
5716,a a mountaineer who can easily spend 14 hour day this just doe not do it for it me highly unlikely i would move over from the garmin fenix series also no one care about about a compass in my world not sure why apple think that is a great feature to show off
5717,i never saw the point of purchasing one i do not have a social life i do not wear watch i check the time on my phone or a clock and i do not work out
5718,try to at least have a good diet when i wa a teenager i think i could have relate to this comment but when i got to my 20 is i either lifted weight or had an ok diet finally at 31 year old i feel like i am finally consistent with a good diet weight lifting and cardio took a long time for me lol but i think health is important
5719,so doe he really wear his watch on his right wrist or is he flexing the scar on his hand
5720,crazy intro
5721,do you always switch between wrist and band multiple time per day
5722,nah i will keep my series 4
5723,iphone ultra coming 2023
5724,regarding the color garmin ha a darker dlc coating for their titanium it legit prevents smaller scratch and is closer to space gray
5725,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5726,i wonder if the warranty would be voided by electro anodizing the case guess i wait a couple year before trying
5727,apple ha made black titanium apple watch in the past my dad ha the 6 in titanium in black and the coating is not scratched or anything apple just choose not to do it so that they can make it seem like a huge feature next year
5728,diamond like carbon seems like the appropriate technology for this scratch resistant and deeper pigment black and dark grey only though i think apple deliberately made this one in a single colour though
5729,totally derived from the watch but i do see iphone footage littered through out it almost seemless good stufd
5730,wish they had some sort of chest wrap they could adapt this to a a hockey goalie it is really annoying to have anything on your wrist when you are wearing a chest protector
5731,love it and love the color stunning
5732,did not expect to see that john mayer dw 6900 here
5733,i already have something massive that stick out lol
5734,69percent battery nice nice indeed
5735,especially a it can not connect with an ipad it is definitely a nah so strange that if you do not want an iphone but you love ipads you just can not use these
5736,intro graphic are insane
5737,so you are changing the position of your watch when you are driving your car
5738,doe this ultra encompass all the series 8 feature in addition to the ruggedness and
5739,13 06 more cameo from ultimate game and practice please
5740,nice to see the lego bonsai make it to the studio lol
5741,i have got a feeling this is going to be another one of those jeep mall crawler situation we will see more people using it because they like the rugged look than people actually using it for it intended use
5742,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5743,ti anodizing is a light to dark bronze color spectrum kind of the pc beige of high tech device meh full disclosure all my apple device are silver anodized al or sus it age gracefully and match everything
5744,this cat forgot the group of people who have no desire to do any extreme anything and just want the big watch for look i am an android user and have been since 2008 but i picked up this watch because of it design could not care le about the dive computer or what extreme sport enthusiast think many of u just like gadget i even bought a 250 dollar band form nomad good review first time ive ever watch one of his review
5745,with the name ultra it should be ultra enough to be connected to android typical apple would never let that happen though
5746,what keyboard is that you have at 8 09
5747,did not even went to the end of the video yet but i had to comment on this intro come on guy these animation are pure magic and listening with earbuds the stereo sound got me flying
5748,the battery itself is the only reason why i want this watch
5749,why is the watch in cinema mode
5750,let is take a moment to appreciate the fact that marque ha officially monetized his stick man figure he proved all his teacher wrong
5751,apple know exactly how to charge more for their stuff
5752,look so weird on the right hand
5753,in term of design it look more like something apple would have released in the early 2000s especially with that orange strap on it
5754,i do not understand why they keep marketing for athlete the simple fact that it is rugged ha caught my eye i have a landscaping business and work with different material every day including water if they were to market it towards people who do hard labor work they would reach a new market say saying and i am really debating getting this one because i have a a 5 series and it hold up really well however the battery for me is where it get me
5755,i bet there will be a graphite color in future iteration but man the ultra would look great in a space black
5756,the pro name is still for the enthusiast ultra is for a very niche group
5757,apple watch ultra iphone 14 pro 3 week on some nice greek island i pick greece
5758,this video kinda make me miss apple
5759,so i could see many ordinary apple watch user with a normal or larger wrist who would have gotten the stainless steel 45mm apple watch that also ha a sapphire crystal get this instead which get them an even larger display much better battery life the extra button and louder speaker and even more rugged for close to the same price in fact the series 7 45mm stainless steel with the milanese loop wa also dollar799 great in depth review mkbhd a always
5760,did you have to fully charge and then wait until it is fully drained and do this a couple of time to increase it is charge capacity
5761,i love when marque say pro cute american accent
5762,i got more than that on my galaxy watch 5 pro after the latest update
5763,g shock kid are going to love this watch some people go for oversized watch by choice
5764,this watch is like a rolex cuz it ha crazy feature this is watch will be my daily drive and my favorite youtuber mkhbd is doing a review
5765,funny fact the link to this video show me everything of this video title link comment etc except the actual video instead it show me a musical video of a band in some library so yeah the watch look good i do not use apple thing
5766,so here is a question i always would hear that if you leave your watch on u while sleeping it bad for u and it will leave that mark on ur skin that come from wearing the watch overnight anybody have this problem for them or no
5767,how did you sleep with that brick on your wrist
5768,i am just clumsy and my apple watch series 5 ha lot of scratch and scuff i am buying this just for durability
5769,coming from a series 3 bought on launch day i decided to definitely go big and rugged my ultra is on the way and i can not wait to have it on my wrist
5770,they will never get the endurance crowd they belong to garmin the garmin forerunner are a million time better than this apple watch and almost half the price
5771,my apple watch series 2 recently died and seeing the ultra actually pushed me to get a garmin watch instead for the money the battery life is what ultimately swayed me away from the apple watch
5772,yoo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5773,hahaha what
5774,fire intro and ofcourse top notch cinematography oh the watch yea amazing too
5775,try the galaxy watch 5 pro review
5776,think of the kid who have not had a meal today before you buy this
5777,great feature but i could not imagine taking this out for a proper treck or adventure a advertised battery life is still measured in hour not day if it can last mon friday min then it will have the attention for me i do not need another thing to add for my battery anxiety
5778,at 800 buck no thank you not worth it
5779,can i get any unused iphone
5780,please do a review like this for the pixel watch generally on why android watch still can not catch up with apple
5781,hat off to the editor those intro never feel bored
5782,dollar99 band not gon na happen
5783,yes apple is on the right track but we need more in that watch not good yet
5784,take the path or nj transit why are you driving into nyc
5785,cheap android watch last 2 week in a single charge
5786,what if someone who isnt a avid hiker or anything like that want this watch just cause it a bigger display and battery life i have a bigger wrist so the ultra would look normal on me
5787,if you are looking forward to get this watch for outdoor i guess that outdoor trip should be from morning to evening and get back home end of the day with a dead watch on the wrist atleast 1 week battery backup would have been appreciated with this price tag
5788,genuinely insane intro sequence so many little touch that really sell it that i think most people will have missed sick
5789,you seemed so obsessed with battery life most people will charge it either at night or if used for sleep tracking maybe an hour or so before sleep
5790,jono tan all like i guess no one like
5791,first minute of the video felt like he purposely do those workout just for testing and doing the review professional reviewer
5792,i like the term ultra better for this watch because it implies that it is different from pro example the word ultramarathon the word ultra in front of marathon implies endurance or distance so for this watch ultra mean more sporty whereas pro in apple is sense mean more tech y
5793,i am a rock climber and i loved my apple watch but i had to replace the screen 2 time in the first year so i ended up getting rid of it i switched to the whoop band and it just did not help the way i wanted i think i could get behind this watch
5794,can i tell it to change channel on my tv can i tell it to find a movie episode next time a show is on or other and tell it which screen to put that on can it control a tv light blind radio can it be the interface to control everything else
5795,that waypoint tech is just sick god damn
5796,it would annoy the crap out of me to wear it on my forearm like you do a watch is meant for the wrist lol
5797,doe anyone know if it is possible to put gps coordinate into the watch the use case i am considering this for is sailing race we get instruction before the race with all the mark that need to be rounded would be nice to see if we can plug those all in and then start the path to finish on the watch
5798,the calorie tracker on watch and other device is not accurate so the 2000 calorie is unlikely
5799,the video editing animation for this review are chef kiss
5800,i do not mind big watch but that thing look bloody uncomfortable i wish they made like an ultra s smaller battery sure but a size that would be managable then again i did not even like the normal apple watch that much when i had it it just dig into your wrist when you bend your hand once i bent down to tie my shoe and accidentally called the police on the watch they really need to make these thing more ergonomic i am thinking of getting the small and thin samsung watch i switched to pixel so apple watch is a no go either way
5801,people who wear watch on their dominant hand bother me so much
5802,3 day for a watch battery everyone this is so silly
5803,with a price of 999 euro in europe this is a perfect no thank you value unfortunately i want one so bad soooo
5804,ultra ha a connotation to a lot of runner 50 or 100 mile run those are ultra runner they race ultras i think a smarter name could have been apple watch max or pro but that is just my quick dollar0 02 we will do some testing and see how it go stay classy marque
5805,this boi said 3hrs of practice bruv
5806,im a normal guy normal life 30 min workout daily just go to college which watch should i get the se
5807,once again uk customer get riped off from apple uk apple store sell them for 849 gbp apple is so greedy nahh apple rather spend money on tissot watch then this
5808,can this go through a metal detector i hate taking my watch off when going through a metal detector everyday at my job
5809,i ordered one just for the battery
5810,marque doe not do review he doe ultra review
5811,bro what is that steering wheel
5812,0 10
5813,ultra thing from apple rip wallet
5814,i think it is ultra not pro because there will be an apple watch pro smaller form factor and some feature that is not in any watch yet
5815,apple ehi why do not you own an apple watch since you own pretty much every product we make me because it doe not look like a normal watch and you make big smartwatches for my tiny wrist apple ok thank we will make the next one bigger and le watch like me
5816,frisbee tournament hmmm
5817,nice intro for the watch
5818,you missed a critical feature my apple watch is a platform i can open my garage with the action button or respond to a text from my friend or take a call from my kid or know if the tide are coming in or out be reminded of an appointment pay for my meal using apple pay check my ecg etc
5819,change the orientation of the watch set it to right wrist wearer it will help with accidentally hitting the action button a the crown will face outward
5820,interested in how it felt sleeping with this big dog on your wrist all night
5821,thorough and entertaining a always thanks mkb
5822,agree with the name i think they burned the ultra name a bit early with this one
5823,the scar is badass
5824,if i spend 800dollar that thing better fetch my beer the 40dollar mi band that last more than a week make more sense
5825,any opinion if the apple watch ultra can replace your phone
5826,battery life suck for 800
5827,the one thing that most people seem to miss is that it doe not really matter if someone think they need this watch or not because there are literally going to be million of people that just want it sure they do not need it but they will get it anyway because they want it apple generally make great product that people just want
5828,aha embargo just on time for me to decide whether to buy or not on friday
5829,a the owner of a smart watch the answer is no smart watch are about the most worthless and least worn watch you can buy get yourself a good solar atomic casio abc watch that you will never have to change the battery on never ever have to charge and that is always right you just put it on the nightstand and forget it and put it on your wrist when you need it no charging no dead battery no firmware upgrade no app installs no unable to read the screen in bright light no wifi or bluetooth connection problem none of that garbage just a good solid always working always right watch if you want to do anything else pull out your smart phone and enjoy a big screen and longer run time smart watch are huge fail smart watch are fun to take on a camping trip and play with in the tent at night when you have lot of time and nothing else to do and just want to be distracted by any technlogy and that is about it like an obsolete psp everywhere else they are almost entirely useless
5830,the little met gala flex at the end living the dream marque
5831,wow fuuutuer 2 day of charge
5832,considering i have been using the space gray titanium watch since series 5 they can definitely make a black one of these which i am assuming in apple fashion they will release it halfway through the life cycle next year just to get attention like they did with the green iphone 13 series
5833,a a mechanic this watch is perfect my series 5 ha taken an absolute thrashing over the year even needed apple care replacement a few time this ultra is perfect rugged a hell and long lasting battery for sleep tracking and longer day it is perfect
5834,i do not really like garmin or samsung so i hope this is worth the upgrade from my 6
5835,12 58 how many time did you shot that
5836,the intro are fire the new raw footage shot are cool too
5837,in india this watch cost approx the same price a the iphone 14 once it release
5838,it hard to choose between apple watch ultra and samsung galaxy watch 5 pro can make a comparison between them mkbhd
5839,2k calorie burned he is good for the week fam
5840,god that intro blew me away
5841,sick intro
5842,nice
5843,best bit of the video wa that beside the illustration he would spelt ultra in scrabble letter
5844,who is going to dive 40m with iwatch on or ur going to use specialized for diving eq how is the gps accuracy in it if we talking about hiking
5845,some tell marcus left hand for men right hand for woman

5847,that 2 day battery life always felt like a dream but it is real now
5848,69percent battery nice
5849,price is the reason that i don t use apple watch
5850,garmin is better
5851,not a single person did say this watch is expensive casue they know the feature doe come in even more expensive watch
5852,what a spectacular frisbee catch marque
5853,that intro is dopeeeeee
5854,not me all patiently waiting for the galaxy watch 5 pro review from week ago guess that is a no
5855,add youtube and it would be worth dollar800
5856,69percent nice d
5857,69 nice i caught that lol
5858,i like the effort you have put to showcase middle of nowhere 9 23
5859,nah
5860,that intro wa killer best watch review intro so far
5861,the animation and intro is level up each video i am mesmerised
5862,i will link the episode in the description below the like button smooth
5863,whered you get that shirt
5864,is it just me or doe the background look fake
5865,why did not mkbhd give the watch to casey neistat and let him have a run with it
5866,mine is arriving friday
5867,watching marque video is like a double edge sword i do not need the apple watch ultra i do not even want the apple watch ultra but watching his video make me want to want the ultra so i guess i am really blaming brandon for making these animation so freaking you suck brandon but not really i am a fan
5868,charged my coros apex pro 1 week ago after 15hr of gps activity constant hr and sleeptracking i have 60percent left
5869,the apple watch ultra just isnt good enough for me i do not care about calorie count or how much i worked out or how many step i have done i just want a watch that make phone call and text and most importantly last longer than a week this just doesnt cut it for me i do not have the time to take my watch off and on every morning and night i just simply can not on top of that the battery doe wear down after a solid 4 month hell whats that battery on that watch after a year look at the apple watch 7 whats the battery percentage now
5870,hit like after the nice
5871,nah look like an altoid tin on your wrist
5872,i want a compilation of marque saying i wore the apple watch to the met gala i am sure there is at least 7 instance
5873,hell nah
5874,i see apple skipping the apple watch 9 and go directly to 10 or x having 4 tier se watch pro and ultra to fully capture the market will require the blood pressure or glucose monitoring
5875,someone tell apple not the beatles that wrist are curved they could make a curved watch to match the wrist shape or wait for someone else to do that first again to be fair it look like a useful product wrist computer are useful who knew
5876,how do you burn 2000 kcal in one workout like whole shit i got ta start doing what you do
5877,of course it is not worth it lol
5878,i have been waiting for this durable watch i always wear my apple watch at the gym or when i am coaching for my son baseball team it is always with me through my daily activity so i am stoked to upgrade thanks mkbhd you always keep it real and the review are quality a always
5879,the watch ultra is like that spot inside the yinyang
5880,i do not really care about the watch i am way more impressed that you just casually do 2000kcal 3 hour practice what the heck do you do carry concrete block
5881,when a actual pro thing came out apple named it ultra
5882,i love his creativity and hard work into this channel and production the only thing is left wrist
5883,can we talk about the scar on the back of marque hand
5884,frankly i just got myself a huawei gt3 pro last me 12 day or so if i do not put always on display and i can do everything the new apple ultra watch can do and it is only 300 usd and there r decent discount in u a e where i live n work the only pain point is loading it i sincerely suggest that u check it out
5885,what is up with that scar on your wrist to get crucified or something
5886,i ended that day going to sleep with about 69percent battery nice
5887,in my country it 1200euros
5888,doe it track paddling stand up like garmin yet and track all data v needing an app for that
5889,would instantly buy it if it came in black
5890,wow i charged my fenix 2 week ago now i have only one week of charge left
5891,apple pro ultra v samsung ultra pro
5892,iphone 15 ultra coming next year
5893,tepar are saala ee to humlog bolte hain jaise ee tablewa tani tepar ba ho
5894,one of my favorite intro ever so effective
5895,give u an iphone ultra like this extra long battery i do not care if it is thicker make it twice a thick and triple or quadruple the battery life
5896,white person get and want it white
5897,give u an iphone ultra like this extra long battery i do not care if it is thicker make it twice a thick and triple or quadruple the battery life
5898,that intro is improve in the every single video love it
5899,gshock got an add for free xd i love gshock watch btw
5900,0 22 ha a tesla with an enormous screen still us phone for navigation though it show that tesla should allow carplay android auto because waze is just better
5901,haha it look like an iphone strapped to your wrist
5902,a watch with just two day battery life is still insane to me
5903,marque could you bring motorola flagship on your channel for one time
5904,look is like kid watch
5905,the withing is watch ha some of the same feature but ha a 2 week battery life might be worth a look
5906,take the train my dude it is new york city
5907,this art work
5908,i remember when x wa a big thing like artist labeling their album x or song title is x and apple had iphone xr now we are surrounded with pro and ultra i wonder whats next
5909,i wa planning on buying a series 7 once the series 8 launched but i ended up ordering the ultra because i really wanted the scratch resistance which really closed the price gap throw in the massive battery gap and i am surprised anyone would buy a top end series 8 instead of the ultra
5910,i would imagine you could stretch that battery out even more by putting it in low power mode throughout the day then turning it off when you go into your workout like a few other people that have commented i am upgrading to this from a series 7 primarily for the ruggedness and the extended battery life i am one of those people that wear my watch at night my alarm is my watch vibrating to wake me up so having a much uptime between charge is my ideal my logic is the le i have to charge the watch the longer i can stretch the actual life of the battery out read degradation and the ultra seems to be heading in the direction i need the apple watch to go not gon na lie i miss the week long battery life i would get out of my old pebble watch but obviously watch like the apple watch do significan notly more looking forward to getting my ultra
5911,m1 ultra watch ultra ultra must be top top of the line wait will we get iphone 16 ultra max with 360 camera
5912,well some people also did not used the apple watch bcoz it frikin expensive that is why they are not using it
5913,anyone here watched the intro multiple time
5914,still no water damage coverage i presume
5915,i am not in any of the three outlier category you mention but this is the apple watch i have been waiting for i have had the stainless steel series 5 for 3 year it is been through a lot of daily bump without a scratch i took a fall in a parking lot and it put a small gouge in the case by the edge of the crystal but did not scratch the crystal at all the a few month ago it fell face down on a stone tile floor and broke the crystal the ultra would have survived that fall i want the durability and the battery life also it is only dollar50 more than my series 5 wa so the price is actually reasonable
5916,i prefer my garmin fenix 7 smaller and i love powerglass but for me apple watch ultra ha cellular is a lovely feature
5917,can not wait to get mine
5918,apple ha an unusual understanding of rugged it doe not fit mine
5919,interesting the endurance guy said that 2 main thing most people i talked basically said the walled garden is the main problem 1 can not connect your bike tech sport tech to it 2 it doe not speak to other apps like the training apps out there it life only on apple and if you are trying to manage your peaking it get hard without all these add ons i am convinced all these feature are not actually for the people mentioned at the extreme but rather a way to entice the core guy to upgrade there is 1 ecosystem that is harder to knock off than the apple ecosystem that is the garmin ecosystem in sport tracking
5920,i would love to get one but it would look like a brick on my wrist lmao
5921,hey marque you owe me an ipad pro
5922,69percent battery is all am here for
5923,all those sound effect
5924,that is better than the wsj reviewer is day and a half but still my garmin last two week and i do not even need to bring a charger on vacation and i realize it is a matter of opinion but i think the apple watch is just so incredibly ugly
5925,battery life alone is enough for me to buy one of those not needing to worry about charging for a full day is amazing
5926,always a fan of your work but i feel like you are missing the point though mainstream people will buy the apple watch ultra to have the best apple watch in term of feature and for battery life also a bigger and bolder size is a fashion statement and always ha been
5927,loved the vdo but can we all know what in those box that are behind you the whole vdo p
5928,the people serious about marathon and triathlons are going to be wearing a garmin or coros lol i doubt many use apple
5929,this intro look like it is directly out of an apple office so sick
5930,i take the galaxy watch
5931,total overkill for the vast majority of smart watch user a you say but people will buy it in their drove to have the latest and greatest and justify it with the added durability battery life and the display etc which is fine but when it come to the cost it is gbp70 more than the stainless steel series 8 gbp6 month on interest free credit over 12 month and the added functionality make it a much easier choice your money spend it how you want
5932,apple could not name it watch pro the name is trademarked by lg
5933,maybe an stupid question wa the gps enabled when you worked out i own a garmin fenix 6 and the battery last week and with a heavy use of gps either biking and running
5934,you should get your hand on some top of the line garmin or suunto watch so we can see how the apple watch compare to dedicated sport watch
5935,i just wish they would support ant
5936,can the other apple watch series watch band fit in this apple watch ultra
5937,that wa one hell of a catch you seem to be a great frisbee player would love to watch you play btw nice review loved it
5938,what an amazing intro it wa simple but loved the animation
5939,if you are in the wild for 3 day your watch is going to die naaaah
5940,nah
5941,is it a real sapphire glas this time
5942,why would a hiker thats been walking for day use this where would he charge the watch
5943,a lot of these feature exist in galaxy watch pro but at almost 40percent low price comparison will be interesting
5944,lg owns watch pro because they saw this coming
5945,that is a wicked scar on the back of your right hand how would you do that
5946,why the tuna can on yo wrist
5947,i like the bigger face easier to read and actuate look sleek
5948,i wonder why he ha not done a galaxy watch pro video yet
5949,in my view it look a bit silly on skinny wrist also the capability is not going to be useful for a sizeable population of people that being said neither is a 4x4 car when only driving in the city so go for it if that is your thing
5950,90000 r for apple watch ultra in india rip apple watch craze
5951,that wa very casey neistat of you to make a drawing
5952,20percent off retail
5953,you did not even review the extra microphone and speaker for call quality you are slipping dude
5954,hate apple but if they made it completely compatible with android phone i would rock the apple watch
5955,is it cool yes is it worth it nah
5956,i have ordered an apple watch ultra it is my first apple watch i am not doing extreme sport like that but here are the reason i got it 1 i am an io developer and i want to have all the feature available on the physical device i own so i can properly test everything 2 battery life 3 i am quite tall and my wife think a big watch would look better on me thanks for another great review marque
5957,with about 69percent battery me at the same time nice
5958,boooo ring
5959,this guy suck at giving review tell u the fking feature that make it better i do not give a fk about the aesthetic i can see the fkn aesthetic you weirdo shaddap you look tired and depressed bro it is time to give it up
5960,the reason i do not use the watch is just because people look like idiot all using the same watch the beauty of life is diversity
5961,450k view in 1 hour
5962,i am desperately waiting to get mine on october 5th in bangalore india loved your video love the apple watch ultra look like a beast of a smartwatch love you apple
5963,i have had a black titanium movado watch that i wear every day during my work servicing mri machine and the black color ha not at all scratched anywhere on the band it is super durable and doe not get pulled by even the strongest mri magnetic force
5964,apple x invicta
5965,i have a huawei watch my wife ha a series 7 she always everyday tell me to charge her watch and plug it in while it already 2 week and my huawie still have 3percent which is still good for around 2 day
5966,being in law enforcement this should be a win
5967,review the garmin counterpart just for fun
5968,a a scuba diver who ha reached the max limit for recreational diving i wa really excited about the ultra but apple and oceanic let u down by paywall ing the actual dive computer capability by requiring a subscription hopefully more company in the future have apps compatible with the ultra
5969,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
5970,i would love to see shearwater or maybe even cressi take a crack at an app for the ultra i know suunto and garmin would not do it since they have their own product to support and sell but it would be pretty neat to see more than oceanic is app on the ultra
5971,reclusive eagle the price of normal dive computer are not low a well many are at the dollar800 level and they do not need extra subscription
5972,have fun scuba diving with only 10atm
5973,reclusive eagle if you are spending 800 usd on hardware and after that happily pay 80usd a year to use the aforementioned hardware then you are brainwashed i would rather pay 100 150usd for the software a price that can get you an used dive computer anyway
5974,man wearing that on your right hand look so awkward especially with the crown on the right hand side
5975,0 10 noice
5976,to me this doe not get me there i bought an garmin epix 2 this year which is a fenix with that nice oled screen instead of that bland battery saving display that sacrifice some battery but still i get 14 day on that thing with at least an hour of activity every day and with display always on i still get a week sure this doe not have the superb smartwatch feature that apple watch have but the garmin watch are league ahead in activity feature seems to me that if you are into the hole ultra aspect big hike long run and diving the garmin feature set should be so much more appealing especially combined with the battery would love to here a counter point to this
5977,i notice in the apple store listing for the watch ultra it say band are not water resistant i am in the uae maybe that is just an anomaly to this store but if they are selling an dollar800 watch to extreme sport enthusiast with band that could fail if they get wet imagine the watch falling off while diving or down a mountain while hiking it seems like that is a serious problem
5978,a goodas it is a many feature a it ha i am never gon na spend 800dollar on a smartwatch especially here in europe where it is likely to cost closer to 1000dollar i mean an iphone 14 pro plus this smartwatch would run an average european consumer almost 2200 2400dollar that is almost half a year of rent in a major european city
5979,gosh that intro that intro brilliant
5980,can not really justifydollar800 on this when my dollar35 xiaomi doe more than half the feature of iwatch with 15 day of battery life but i guess if you have money to spare whatever
5981,0 10 gawd daymh i heard it clearly
5982,great video marque couple of thing i think you became more humorous i like that and i think you really enjoyed the met gala
5983,nah
5984,love the voice by 20syl intro take me waaay back
5985,this watch is a total overkill for most user and i love it can not really afford it but i love these type of overkill device being launched
5986,man that intro sick
5987,i am an ultramarathon runner and i am really curious a to whether this could handle a full ultramarathon where i would use my watch for direction and map a well a traditional gps tempted to pick one up
5988,how did you get into running
5989,a someone who work in electro hydrodynamics this watch basically doe everything i need it to do also i don t know what that is this watch is just cool
5990,not buying till a non cellular version is available
5991,i am a rock climber but honestly i do not see how this watch appeal to my sport other than being more rugged i am still going to get it tho lol
5992,love your stuff and im only saying this because i hold you to a higher standard and know what you are capable of not your best review my friend did not get into nitty gritty technical spec or detail like resolution nit actual weight showing screenshots or demonstration of depth gauge pretty low quality shot too not your usual feel slapped together
5993,i know this watch ha an audience but it sell a the only apple watch with a decent battery still not good too so i think lot of apple watch user will switch to this thing because of that
5994,not racist but mark talking about black be like
5995,holy moly gbp849 for a smart watch more than my s22 ultra at launch no matt black version huge oversize styling nah not for 99percent of people imo
5996,this watch is absolutely not for most tech nerd reviewing it that is for sure lol
5997,this is the one i have been waiting for the review i mean
5998,nice touch adding the ultra scrabble letter at the top of the drawing
5999,is that normal to go in the red zone higher than 180 bpm that often even with heavy duty effort
6000,this watch is definitely not for men with these skinny wrist lol maybe le frisbee and more lifting
6001,damn i can literally buy 2 3 phone with that 800dollar
6002,a a member of the endurance audience i do not think this watch is it it is not just the inferior battery life it is the metric and sensor that company like garmin polar and suunto have created great training feature around i need a watch that will last day and day without a charge not just day but it is cool how long this last for an apple watch
6003,2 35 i thought he wa drawing an apple watch by number
6004,be tough to break into the ultramarathon world though where watch can last a full week without charge and racer will be using gps for 20 hr
6005,i wa in the hospital recently without my charger for my galaxy watch 5 pro and it lasted the 4 day i wa in the hospital my watch 4 hardly made it through a day i wa pretty impressed it seems this is the year of good battery life in smart watch which is awesome
6006,this is exactly what i have wanted in an apple watch for year now rugged larger and brighter screen awesome battery life i am so hyped to get my order on friday
6007,i would just buy this watch for it battery and look
6008,this review suck
6009,to me nah not a safe dive watch a for the battery i usually charge it every night so i do not really need an extra long battery a for the watch face not impressed sorry
6010,damn man that one third of my huawei watch battery life
6011,69 nice mkbhd is a legend
6012,i am no adventurous person i am a city life goer but battery life is of the utmost important to me and a reason why i never used an apple watch i did not want something else to have to charge every night
6013,ended that day with 69percent battery that is nice
6014,a a tech geek and a watch nerd this plea me i have enjoyed some short run with the apple watch a few time but i stick to my mechanical watch just ordered a studio underd0g watermel0n watch pink and green if you want someting out of the normal you should google it they are up for order for the next few hour
6015,there is one more grup of people who just want a bigger battery
6016,i really wan na know which one you plan on wearing daily
6017,i would buy one if it included a tv remote control
6018,are there third party case and band to add even more ruggedness to the device
6019,this is the premium watch they should have built instead of the ceramic and gold
6020,reason not to use it battery and io
6021,that intro is sick
6022,what about skydiving for altitude and whatever else
6023,i do not know for me hiking and camping can be longer than 2 day so that watch will die for me there are way to charge with solar panel but garmin is just better
6024,i prayed for time like this for vids like this
6025,no digital watch will ever be worth that much in my opinion and they are not collectible so why bother i would stick with the old school watch that have physical material
6026,you can make out like this is only for extreme athlete but a a fat guy this totally appeal to me for the larger screen and better battery life
6027,am i the only one who doe not dig any smart watch whatsoever i mean the thing they can do are amazing do not get me wrong but i will always prefer analog watch and if i want a worker watch i will get digital g shock
6028,i have a watch it show me the time nice i am satisfied fuck apple customer
6029,never heard any siren never got to know about the new gps performance is it a review
6030,absolutely not worth not because is ultra not because is watch but because is apple
6031,i could not use watch which last only for 2 3 dat a week is minimum
6032,now if they could make an iphone ultra that is slightly thicker with 3 day battery
6033,like how the apple watch is slowly developing into the all in one watch with better battery life i will be keeping a close eye on future development
6034,apple is going to make a separate watch pro
6035,doing a review of this ultra without really testing the ultra feature is useless i listened the podcast and imho the part related to scuba diving is ridiculous
6036,i am disappointed the action button is not an all purpose programmable button i wa planning on programming it to open the calculator because i am a massive nerd
6037,great video game review 1
6038,ha anyone mentioned you are the king of intro
6039,most likely someone already commented that but 100 wr doe not mean you can dive for 100 meter you can go like max 10 meter tho anyway very good video a always
6040,a a person running marathon and doing triathlons i would not buy this garmin and wahoo just do the stuff i need better including battery and integration
6041,after watching this video i decided the apple watch ultra is comically large i am gon na stick with the series 8 which wa a big upgrade from the series 3
6042,damn 800 buck for a watch 0 0
6043,damn 800 buck for a watch 0 0
6044,drop the ruggedness and most of the extra feature and just give me more battery life
6045,this watch cost the same a the stainless steel apple watch have cost for so much more battery and feature i am not sure why people keep throwing out that 800 00 price like it is unprecedented
6046,marquez i am going to get one eventually but do not understand why apple made the watch like series 8 where face gallery screen are much larger i wish apple could have made the face screen much larger on this
6047,fire everyone retain intro guy
6048,i think there were legal reason why apple could not use watch pro wording
6049,nah too small for text
6050,at the met gala flexxxxxxx
6051,2 day battery for 800 buck
6052,they have had black titanium watch in the past
6053,how well did you sleep with it wa it comfortable
6054,garmin is a lot better for fitness and battery dude
6055,anyone know where the scar on his hand come from
6056,it a pipboy nano
6057,nah
6058,a a non american it sound weird to me to drive into a big city to exercise outdoors i know that new york ha central park but should there not be more nature to run in outside the city at least here i am used to always having a forest nearby to walk in also i find the concept of driving to exercise weird when you can just run or bike where you are but then i know that in the u most city are not made for walking and biking
6059,it feel like it is made for extreme people but still fall short of extreme like there is all these new feature for diver but only casual diver there is stuff for hiker and wilderness people but only casual hiker and i mean like people who maybe camp or hike overnight or over a weekend since it will not last long enough for say a survivalist type outdoors person think bear grylls haha i am just saying it wa marketed to meet the need of people in the fringe of use case but still turn out casual somehow
6060,i am so glad i ordered mine can not wait to get it by october
6061,people underestimate how big this thing is 49 mm in a square shape is huge
6062,i get 3 day easy with my apple watch 7 so not sure why you get so bad battery life i get better battery life with the apple watch 7 than my galaxy watch 4
6063,i do not use apple product but it is good to see them experimenting and expanding a it will encourage the market in general to follow up
6064,the apple watch ultra is essentially killing the very high end gadget the same way that the pro display xdr did
6065,apple samsung what are you going to call your upcoming watch samsung 5 pro apple ok so we will use ultra then samsung no hey wait a sec
6066,wait wait you are burning 2000 calorie holy shittt dude
6067,being always a samsung user i appreciate what apple ha come up to
6068,you forgort another type of person this watch is built for those who are constently trying to show off for no reason
6069,i am honestly always scared of prostate cancer with these thing i feel like it will be blasting my nut with radiation
6070,the way i see the apple watch is that it is a swiss army knife all the feature are there but nothing is done really well for example there is a screw driver in a swiss army knife but if i am someone who us a screwdriver on a daily basis i rather just have a regular screwdriver i think the apple watch ultra is great for people that dive like every other weekend or on vacation but for people that dive for a living i am pretty sure they will stick with dive computer
6071,bro that steering wheel look so uncomfortable
6072,999euros 999dollar in spain europe
6073,quite good but block design and big size is a no for me just feel weird
6074,but is 60hrs roughly battery time good enough for endurance athlete hard core hiker etc
6075,a a lineman that go out on storm and work 30 hour straight and no access to a charger other then the one in the truck i am going to like this watch
6076,but is 60hrs roughly battery time good enough for endurance athlete hard core hiker etc
6077,garmin fenix 7x or garmin enduro 2 the best
6078,they are saving the apple watch pro for their dollar20k version
6079,catalyst case is where apple took the idea for the ultra
6080,hopefully overly expensive watch do not become a thing due to apple
6081,titanium can be easily pvd coated physical vapor deposition it is super strong and will add to your matte black everything vibe
6082,i stopped using my apple watch because the battery only lasted until lunch time
6083,can you buy it for dollar99 just a ll cool j said no i do not think so where samsung pro 5 you have many option buy it for dollar240 or get it from t mobile for dollar99 with exchange of samsung watch which ha similar feature with this who ha dollar800 money to spend so if you add hard watch band then it is going to cost dollar900 plus watch protector cover then it is going to cost dollar1000 are you buying tag huere watch you can buy tag huere at costco and walmart for le than dollar1000 but samsung pro 5 cost are same a regular battery sport active watch i wish both company sends there smart watch to soilder in ukraine for ultimate watch indurance challenge test and see which watch serf and we will find out which watch is best and which watch soilder pick if watch serf in war then defiantly in regular use at home will be nothing
6084,speaking a a recreational tech diver and trail rider i will say that this is the watch for me but the problem is is that it can not fully replace a dive computer a diving requires a backup computer just in case the main computer fails on your wrist and it will not allow for deeper diving with nitrox gas which in today is diving world is very common but for a recreational diver that is regularly doing 90 ft reef this is definitely the watch to get but it will not be replacing my dive computer because that will get strapped to my bc and i will just wear the apple watch on my wrist also i am pretty sure someone out there will make an app that is decent for tracking on trail so i can be able to ride enduro on my motorcycle and be able to have a map of where i went which is the other half of selling me on this watch
6085,where is 800dollar hehehe in my country it 1000dollar
6086,samsung and apple trading ultra and pro naming lmao
6087,the reason apple used ultra instead of pro wa to throw a jab at samsung
6088,the editing is insane marque
6089,i think name of ultra will be new generation of tough thing a they make it for diver i think they should consider some others like people work in desert but today we just heard about problem of 14 pro max camera get some trouble when use some apps of social medium like instagram and tik tok this will affect on selling phone and other eco system of this month
6090,can the ultra store it map or doe it need to be connected to your phone for map update like apple amp google map that is a plus on the garmin is that the map are stored on the watch inself thanks
6091,apple should be arrested for theft for dollar800 it should come with unlimited data for life plus those watch are garbage who want to look at a postage stamp all day
6092,not that impressive 8 01 absolutely not
6093,thanks for a great review i am a marathon runner and a scuba diver and i have dedicated wrist device for both of these activity i also have tiny wrist and hand and have always worn the smallest size of apple watch for every day wear i want to want the new apple watch ultra a it seems like from a feature and functionality perspective it could replace three watch with one but i just do not think i can wear such a giant wrist computer full time
6094,love this dude
6095,why do you switch which wrist you have it on so much or am i just seeing thing
6096,your comment at the end on why this is the best apple watch parallel why so many people who wear and enjoy mechanical watch flock to dive watch robust reliable and can daily wear without worrying about it
6097,mine say established ship date nov 23 to dec 1th and my iphone 14 pro max is oct 24 to oct 31 so i will be waiting a long time
6098,suprised you did not draw the stick figure on ipad pro
6099,i think i will just buy a garmin watch
6100,where is the samsung fold full review samsung flip full review samsung galaxy watch 5 review samsung galaxy watch 5 pro review why doe it seem to me that u care about apple product and fully reviewing every single thing about them but then the rest u r nitpicking everything i really love your review and love you a a person but mate u got to be a little bit biased or if u can not then at least review other product a well a u do with every single apple device
6101,marque the first exposure to your content wa on a google ad and i kind of dismissed you a fake since then i have seen your content and the auto channel and i love your content now i feel bad for thinking the way i thought about you great youtube great review super engaging keep up the good work
6102,love your video so professional it look like apple made your video
6103,at dollar800 this is just filthy cheap they need to jacked up to at least 1k to make it worth my mum is cc
6104,bruh i thought the first dude 12 27 wa romanatwood
6105,they could have easily anodized the titanium on the new apple watch ultra and given u more color option
6106,for me dollar1000 watch is affordable because i know it will outlast me and i can give it to my child but an dollar800 smartwatch that will get outdated in no time nope
6107,bro i love the doodle
6108,i wonder how long it last in gps mode
6109,me looking at my 4 day life on the galaxy watch 5 pro
6110,maybe apple call it ultra because it is their first device in a new line of upcoming exclusive stuff
6111,i have to clean my screen have to clean them all the time can not roll with a dirty screen
6112,what are those keycaps they look dope
6113,what practice
6114,next time they will just put a wrist band on an ipone 5 and call it apple watch pro max ultra oh you poor stupid ppl
6115,what sort of battery life will you get purely on cellular i have the original watch se and routinely leave my phone at home to manage screen on time etc i get through my day with some battery with minimal usage however with moderate usage i probably only get 8 hour before it run out would be interesting to know how it compare to the watch ultra
6116,i am sorry but dollar800 for such a small device is absurd the watch is impressive yes but dollar800 is just too much dollar400 500 would make more sense
6117,your video is mile ahead of apple official promo video suddenly i feel like i actually need to have the ultra in my life and very reasonably so
6118,d all my d could help ya dive and find apple watch d collab collab d
6119,my huawei watch fit can last more than a week
6120,no no it is not
6121,dayum that intro alone should get 99percent on rotten tomato very nice
6122,i need an apple watch ultra i had a garmin it is time for a new watch i am pretty sure this is the one
6123,the silhouette of it on your wrist look a little hilarious like a shrunken down imac buckled to your wrist
6124,we have to wait for the pro version
6125,i would love to have this watch but the only thing i do not like about it is that the speaker start getting crackly and sometimes i can not hear the person i am talking to i surf everyday with my apple watch and put it on surf mode which put it in water mode i am not sure if it is the salt water but i try to soak it in freshwater after i surf my apple watch 7 work fine but the speaker totally suck because maybe from the salt water of the pacific ocean i am not sure i would love to get this watch especially because the battery life when i use my apple watch which ha lte the battery percentage go down pretty fast when i am surfing i surf about two hour a day i just want to see if you can test that mkbhd see if you can test soaking the watch for a couple hour in fresh or even salt water and seeing if this speaker work good if so i would love to get this watch for the battery life and for the sport i do thanks mkbhd
6126,lol drive a tesla and buy a 800dollar watch what a shill to the latest thing
6127,the taper issue is due to the bottom sensor if it wa flat the watch would sit so much better on the wrist
6128,intro is sick
6129,they do not call it pro cause they still have not launched it they want to price the pro dollar1500 they do not sell the word pro le than dollar1000 for whatever product they sell i wa going to fix my iphone one time and i said to the genius bar guy that i have problem with my iphone bro he wanted to charge me dollar200 more but i told him that i said bro and not pro and he fixed it
6130,the longest battery life apple watch ive had wa the original nike watch it lasted 3 full day and 2 full night i wa beyond shocked when i upgraded to the 5th edition apple watch i just got the 8 and it lasting much longer than my 5th edition
6131,lol marque your bougie humor tickle me
6132,i like telling the time i must get this
6133,apple need to pay you for this review free ad you just did
6134,nice watch but one thing missing solar
6135,i wa thinking about upgrading to this from the se and after watching this i might actually do it i bought my se last christmas and loved it but am being held back by it battery and the screen durability my screen currently ha deep scratch and i love using it for sleep tracking but i also work early morning so being able to grab it and go would be amazing plus i just purchased an euc so being able to go on long trail ride with those saftey feature really speaks volume to me
6136,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6137,just get a garmin or something way more in depth review of sleep and relation to fitness readiness battery that actually is good amoled screen option a long a you do not want to text which i never found myself doing come on over to the garmin side haha
6138,i use the garmin fenix and do not feel like this new device is really poised to replace my current watch for a variety of reason first i sleep with my watch to collect sleep data for hrv and recovery status and love that i can go about two week without a charge any time i take the watch off it creates gap in my data whether it is sleep data step hr stress calorie etc i accept these gap and blind spot every 10 to 12 day but would not want them every 2 day let is say second i use my watch mostly for cycling a such the garmin is designed to really work in complement with my head unit garmin edge 1030 plus when i ride outside or my wahoo kickr bike when i ride inside on zwift on ride i can use the broadcast heartrate feature and pair my watch using ant bt and it can replace a traditional hr monitor again i do not use my fenix a a bike computer but on some ride i use it a a hr monitor to pair to my bike computer pretty sure that is a no go for the apple watch last reason is the lack of solar charging while it is not a gamechanger it feel like another area where the apple watch is not really up to current sport smart watch standard
6139,huawei gt 3 pro 350euros same feature 2 week of battery life
6140,i do medium distance tri honestly the one thing that still hold me back aside from the money is the lack of external sensor connection i actually like the workout on my series 6 over my garmin but especially for the bike i need external sensor the next step i can take in my training is getting a power meter for my bike and this ultra would prevent me from doing that if the ultra 2 connects to bt sensor then everyone else is in real trouble
6141,awaiting a sony pro watch costing dollar 1800 to let others know how a pro should be
6142,damn that watch is a beast
6143,there is a certain arrogance with this guy always feel yea i got it and you do not and i am better than you i am done with him
6144,hey that is my pro trek that watch is a tank had it for year same battery and the atomic time keeping is great
6145,even though the apple watch series model are waterproof i still do not trust taking them in the water but with the ultra i feel very confident that it will be fine no matter the condition
6146,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6147,i use my apple watch for swim tracking even before they formally certified a waterproof never had an issue
6148,i have gone to a waterpark with my series 3 and it work fine
6149,i used to take my old series 7000 swimming all the time it wa not even waterproof rated and it wa fine they are all good to go
6150,they are fine in the water
6151,thank you for this review and all others i currently use an apple watch series 4 stainless steel with cellular i am not an ultra athlete do not dive or do not go on hiking expedition i do run 4 5 half marathon a year the occasional full marathon and hike with my son and his boy scout troop nothing ultra about these hike for the activity an apple watch series 8 would be just fine for the price the apple watch series 8 in stainless steel with cellular and apple watch ultra cost the same leaning towards getting and ultra because of the price and the extra feature compared to an 8 but i am still not 100percent sure about it i understand that are other non apple watch but for me it an apple watch 8 or an ultra
6152,appletard
6153,up until this day i still kinda confused why would someone wear a smartwatch
6154,nice

6158,when ordinary ukrainian ask what are we for i have a whole series of question for them what did the russian do to you when you sent your militant to chechnya in the 90 to kill russian soldier why did not you condemn any of the participant in those event and did not extradite them to russia did you tacitly approve of their action what did the russian do to you when you shot down a russian plane over the black sea with citizen of russia and israel at the same time you apologized to the israeli and paid compensation but not to russian family what did the russian do to you when georgia attacked peacekeeper and peaceful city in south ossetia and you supplied air defense system and crew to shoot down russian plane there what did the russian do to you when you stole their gas for many year and blackmailed europe and russia with your pipe asking for the lowest price what did the russian do to you when you jumped on the aidan shouting about the need to hang muscovite and put them on knife why wa the law on the abolition of the regional status of the russian language introduced into the rada by the first law after the coup wa it for the maidan what did the russian in crimea do to you to whom you promised to send friendship train full of nazi and when crimea left did you cut off water and electricity a you said to your citizen what did the russian do to you when you laughed at the people burned in odessa and shot in mariupol when did you joke about colorado shawarma from russian baby may kebab and cut a cake in the form of a russian child in kyiv you thought it wa very funny then what did the russian in the donbas do to you who loved your ukraine just wanted to be russian and speak their native language to honor their hero not yours you killed them for 8 year paid tax to the ato sent your son father brother to kill the same citizen of ukraine a you russia ha been negotiating with you for many year and you having elected a new president once again spit on all the agreement and threatened to create nuclear weapon you were released from the ussr without bloodshed the richest republic of the union and in 30 year you became the poorest country in europe raising a whole generation in hatred for russia and sliding into cave nazism and only after russia realized that there wa no other way out i will no longer remind you that any policy should be aimed at uniting both state and people but today it seems that people really do not i have mirror to look into them
6159,that steering wheel look uncomfortable
6160,i am buying this ultra a an upgrade from my series 7 just because i like it although i am a couch potato so in your video it look like you are able to swap watch band with the regular apple watch also is the trail loop a magnetic band or a velcro band
6161,velcro
6162,huge editing dude keep moving lt 3
6163,great content
6164,you filmed outside with the iphone it is easy to tell
6165,love it apple actually created a true tool watch and it definitely look the part
6166,nobody mkbhd i wore an apple watch at the met gala
6167,pretty sure they could dlc coat it diamond like coating
6168,impressed with battery life my question is doe it overheat in hot weather 105degrees condition i am in arizona and my samsung watch 3 overheats after 45 minute when i go on my 3 hour run
6169,i am impressed how the apple watch user praised the new long life battery of this watch meanwhile my 3y old galaxy watch still can do the same a this watch when it come to battery life hr monitor is always active
6170,maybe apple want to slowly move away from the pro designation for future device
6171,every mkbhd intro is always so detailed you can tell the editor had a lot of fun with making them
6172,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6173,jamez martinez
6174,this had no intro
6175,that intro wa sick they keep 1uping themselves
6176,i understand why a diver or iron man activity where this can be useful but hiking in the mountain that activity happens for more than 3 day good luck with that
6177,the gfx for your video are constantly out doing themselves
6178,not sure about others but personally when i decide on specialized gear it longevity potential is a important a it feature set a piece of electronic kit that go with me underwater and on which arguably my life depends on might be frequently maintained seal and whatnot a key navigation item for an extreme hike journey into a wilderness need to survive very tough condition and survive consistently once again maintenance sometimes quite frequent is required for extreme runner i do not run ultras or even half marathon myself but even for a fast 5k i want to optimize for lightweight and balance in my load out sometimes even my current watch series 4 feel a tad bulky and i can feel it weight maybe ultra jack of trade but really a master of none and might be of interest for those already in the ecosystem and willing to drop some extra dollar on their fav gadget and maybe have their occasional hobby improved by it
6179,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6180,i am more curious to see if marque will compare this to other actual gps watch for those scenario like you stated i myself run ultras and can pickup a coros apex that besides not being in the apple ecosystem of course pretty much doe everything this watch doe an apex weighs 6g le cost literally le than half the price dollar349 last 30 day on regular usage 35 hour on normal gps tracking and up to 100 hour on super efficient gps tracking even their highest end watch the vertix 2 still run dollar100 le than this one so i can definitely see a potential for people wanting to integrate it into their ecosystem just in my case even a someone who it is meant to be a target for i find it hard to justify still
6181,for regular sport like running some bicycle ride i am happy with my sigma id and it cost around 100euros
6182,que fineza de intro
6183,10 35 new dell xps
6184,samsung named their flagship phone a ultra and iphone use the pro or pro max since samsung released their watch 5 pro earlier apple decided to use the ultra for their flagship watch could this be the case
6185,absolutely like that watch but i wil never get it though i will not use it for what it wa made
6186,hiking diving trekking rock climbing much
6187,10 30 should have typed your mom
6188,but why ha pro or extreme more battery that is what everyone is going for doe not have to be a pro or extreme
6189,i might think about maybe getting one in a year when it get a markdown 800 is crazy rocking the s5 til who know when
6190,excellent review a always but a scar on your hand caught my eye what happened
6191,just bought this last week and waiting for it to arrive next week super excited
6192,i had been watching you do not know but from a long time and every time i appreciate your background and every detail regarding to color matching to the pattern and every sort but in today is vdo this wa the worst background i had ever seen i do not know why but when i see your back i do not even watch the whole vdo and just commented before 2 min of vdo please i do not expect such background in next vdo i think u a of my family member so i told you bcoz it is my right see you in next vdo
6193,not for me my deepest dive to date is 150 foot it should be 300m rated should have solar charging
6194,i think it look absolutely horrible silver is meh orange is ugly and the giant button and wheel make it hideous and bulky
6195,i find that battery quite important only reason i have been using garmin is the battery life actually
6196,paris even forerunner 255 with multiband on we have at least gt 15 hour and that is with every second gps heart rate recording
6197,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6198,paris certainly not the case with my f nix 6 sapphire
6199,nine day on a wyze watch but it is not near a sophisticated a an apple watch
6200,that wa one thing i found weird about my garmin is everyone said the battery life lasted a whole week and it doe until you use the gps then it only last like 3 5 hour
6201,this guy is intro outrageous the apple intro serious hardwork in each frame behind
6202,can i just say everyone my fitbit last longer
6203,when you are going to review series 8 and airpods pro coz im eagerly waiting to buy them but not before your review
6204,dear mkb i just wanted to say that it ha been so awesome watching you over the year on yt from when we were basically kid until now your fun happy video helped me much more than you would know have a good one karyn
6205,i do not even need the ultra i just want it just for the hell of it
6206,dollar800 on a watch that is gon na be obsolete in a few year is a huge hell no for me
6207,too big
6208,looking forward to the new airpods review
6209,0 18 69percent battery nice
6210,00 17 nice
6211,this might be an incredibly handy watch for even construction worker pro for the extremist enthusiast but ultra for the everyday user great review mkbhd
6212,i wish apple offered a bigger battery in the 45mm form factor i do not need all the extreme feature but could really use more battery life
6213,the ultra watch sale will be the lowest outta apple
6214,0 17 that is super nice my brand new series 7 doe in a day
6215,that wa a great dive mind it
6216,marcus doe this mean there could also be an ultra version of the iphone in the near future
6217,a a normal person can i use it without the cellular turn on or with this watch you have to have cellular turn on
6218,it worth it if u want it doesnt matter what anyone else say about it u want one buy one
6219,please review the airpods pro 2
6220,3 hour practice are u running half marathon for daily session
6221,i think the only thing that wa not talked about wa people that like leaving their phone at home so we are streaming music taking phone call and tracking our workout that can crush the battery on a normal apple watch
6222,i would probably have one of these if i could use it with android
6223,did he did he just said he went to sleep with 69percent battery then he said nice 0 14 he is a connaisseur
6224,800dollar nah
6225,such a legendary intro music
6226,that calorie tracker is definitely not accurate
6227,titanium is extremely easy to anodize you just need a glass of water and a power supply basically
6228,13 07 you almost sold
6229,1 02 to 1 12 what a trnsition
6230,ok i understand the word pro is a little loose these day but airpods pro is in my opinion one of apple product that deserve the word pro despite with beat team up i wa incredibly surprised on how flat the sound profile is it is comparable to my sennheiser hd650 that i use to monitor actual movie at work
6231,that intro though
6232,that intro is so sickkk
6233,your drawing skill is gon na to rival jerryrigeverything
6234,a an avid diver this watch look quite compact in comparison to most higher end colorized dive computer i do agree with marque in that i wish the thing wa in anodized black titanium i do not care for the bright silver finish
6235,the ultimate watch for ultimate frisbee look great on you i would make that your daily driver
6236,if this watch is more expensive than your main fitness gear such a a bike you really have no business buying one
6237,he ha a scar in the middle of his hand what is the scar of
6238,mine doe not arrive till nov
6239,love the mojo68 keyboard hanging around your desk
6240,way too expensive
6241,basic apple watch is pure shit when u go on longer bicycle ride because battery die so fast
6242,that yoke
6243,pro over price device that we can profit
6244,you could get it titanium carbo nitride ticn coated matt black and very durable
6245,please switch video ar back to 16 9 or go from 2 1 to full 20 9 dynamic island it is annoying in landscape mode on the new 14 pro max
6246,huawei watch gt 2 pro launched 2 year back had titanium frame sapphire glass amp ceramic back and lastes a week with sleep tracking and all the stuff turn on always
6247,thought about getting the ultra but decided to skip the first gen of that one and wait for the next one need to see how it pan out over time got the series 8 45mm instead
6248,good thing adam will run an iron man for u
6249,it is most attactive for the most extreme user the adventurer people who run marathon people with child
6250,still waiting for galaxy watch 5 review
6251,the ultra is an amazing training tool definitely worth the price
6252,bro what that is how much calorie i burn on a 17 mile run respect
6253,i may get one to replace my current apple watch i dive regularly yet would never use the dive app paying dollar80 a year to use a function on the watch is overkill i own 4 other dive computer two are for technical diving and none of them require a subscription so this watch is sadly useless a a dive watch especially since the max dive depth is only 40 meter i am probably still picking one up i just will not use the dive app
6254,it is more like an iphone on the wrist
6255,also the satellite communication for emergency is part of that narrowed group i just bought a regular apple watch 8 and i hesitated a lot about the ultra and the reason is the satellite communication every year we go in a kayak trip that last 10 day in the middle of nowhere if we have an emergency we would be in a bad mess and emergency communication it would be amazing but then i recall this nowhere trip are in lost area in argentina and satellite communication work in u and canada well
6256,what is the 3 hour practice he mentioned i am really interested
6257,well you got a remember man that watch i have more battery than a cell phone
6258,i know i can not afford apple product i do not know why i am watching this
6259,correct me please if i am wrong but during apple live event have not apple showed more color of ultra because i also tought buy them but i do not like current silver color also wish they could be in black color or something like dark gray
6260,mkbhd i just hope the apple watch ultra come with black colored design dbrand i gotchu mate
6261,the low key met gala flex at the end
6262,what the apple watch should have been
6263,so you not gon na review the z fold flip galaxy watch and bud which came almost a month earlier than apple event
6264,galaxy watch 5 pro review coming soon
6265,hand down one of the best intro i have seen sheeeeeesh
6266,the apple watch ultra is the new land rover defender of watch you can use it for it intended purpose but in reality people who will use it will wear it to the mall and their hiking around the park good idea badly executed in my opinion
6267,could you please review the amazfit gtr 4
6268,what is that massive scar on your right hand
6269,apple just wan na be samsung
6270,fire intro
6271,the intro damn
6272,still watching even though we can not afford it
6273,can you try golf apps i am curious a to the display offering with the ultra watch and determine if it worth getting over a garmin watch
6274,it seems like the garmin you are comparing this to is the forerunner 955 series or higher but the way more common series is the 255 a lot of your comparison on size and cost do not hold true for that cheaper series
6275,great review but it pale in comparison to that awesome catch in the ultimate frisbee match
6276,i have veen waiting for this review
6277,just tell me one thing if you have the apple music subscription can you play music without airpods or an iphone cuz i can not play any music on my series 7
6278,i have veen waiting for this review
6279,you are so watch ble
6280,it is too gaudy
6281,the watch is ugly
6282,the gps pathfinder and satellite function are cool for when you get lost except you better get un lost in le than 2 day or you are screwed
6283,garmin epix gt apple ultra but i did buy a new iphone 14 that camera is 10 10
6284,i am sorry but no way will i pay dollar800 for a watch no matter how good it claim to be
6285,marque you mentioned air integration for scuba diving are you sure can someone actually confirm this
6286,they shouldve added solar charging then it wouldve been a true g shock alternative
6287,i just want some band like those that fit my fossil gen 6
6288,i will keep my garmin fenix 7x where i maybe charge it twice a month it connects to my bike and doe everything i need and way more
6289,i am a lazy piece of shit but i still want one for the larger screen lol
6290,bro acting like the calorie burned are accurate
6291,i like the ultra purely for it look alone
6292,i wa literally waiting for a frisbee catch
6293,what doe travel mean in a button
6294,just a casual clip of mkbhd with that an apple watch on
6295,yeah it ha good battery life but for how long
6296,1000euros hahahah no way apple eat my banana
6297,i kinda want this thing because it is like an apple gshock and it look like it is out of a 70 sci fi movie but dollar800 is a little too much
6298,i will not use 70percent of the feature but i am still buying the ultra
6299,what the f ck wa that insane intro
6300,dang over 2000 calorie
6301,the one key thing he said is can not really hide it but why would you want to hide it a lot of people buy watch to have them stand out not hide them they become an actual accessory now most are probably wearing a rolex or some crazy dollardollardollar watch blinged out with diamond but those are not functional at the same time i like a bigger day to day watch that stand out and is functional for many activity so to me standing out is not a negative but a real selling point of the watch one reason i have never liked the normal apple watch and wore a garmin fenix instead is cause apple watch seemed to dainty and understated on my wrist might actually give this watch a try just for it is size
6302,can you do a video like this for the apple watch series 8
6303,you really know tech and tech marketing excelent review from the perspective of company and consumer
6304,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6305,just saw an xps in an mkb video
6306,shout out to the video editor
6307,on par with samsung watch pro 5
6308,i think there will be a pro which will be placed between regular apple watch and apple watch ultra
6309,they used scott jurek for the ultra running face of the apple presentation scott got his name by willing a lot of 100mile running race yet the watch would not last for a 100mile run usually 24 30hours of gps
6310,the intro gt gt gt
6311,just slap an ipad on your wrist
6312,sadly tank pressure monitoring is not an advance feature in scuba diving and is pretty standard on an dive computer of dollar500
6313,period
6314,anything you think ha le user just give it to africa they will scam you to buy it africa need all this just that most people can not afford only those who do not give can afford
6315,so how will the person who is in the middle of nowhere charge his apple watch
6316,too large to wear if they made a smaller one i would buy it got the 8 a an upgrade to my 5
6317,i believe the name ultra will get replaced from pro in their apple product maybe
6318,script are getting better and better
6319,i can not believe you did not do the review for the galaxy watch and you went ahead to do apple watch review you are not biased tbh
6320,i am curious a to why you think you could not wear this to an event like the met gala other than the international orange button most traditional watch are a stainless silver color or even gold yet i think you would be fine a far a the watch itself i think it will actually help garmin sale in the long run someone want to start getting into fitness and training they buy an apple watch they start to get more serious and realize the apple watch doe not have all their statistic they would like so they get a more suited watch like garmin or sunnto
6321,pretty good compared to other apple thingy but not to other brand
6322,why mkbhd video despite being high resolution burn le internet data i have been noticing this for quite a while because i like to download them to watch it later when i am free
6323,no sure why this is i have noticed similar situation with other channel what give yt
6324,nice diving catch young man great review a always
6325,add a 100dollar and buy yourself an iphone 14 pro where is the logic behind this pricing
6326,like mac pro apple watch pro is still under work i guess
6327,mkbhd is a fruit
6328,for me the ruggedness is kinda weird since the screen is still easily going to be smashed in unfortunate circumstance kinda like putting a ming vase in the middle of the road but painting it bright yellow so nobody hit it
6329,a garmin fenix doe not have a taper you need to get you fact correct for that group that group will never the watch you showed a example
6330,mkbhd intro need to be recognized in some form of award
6331,guarantee apple will release more color and smaller size for the apple watch ultra next year
6332,i really recommend the qualified scientist is youtube channel for scientific review of these device to know how accurately do they actually track your fitness that channel is pure gold
6333,working professional first responder law enforcement construction etc may appreciate this a an apple watch that can simply survive their day to day
6334,if anyone want to know the song in the intro it is 20syl voice feat rita j
6335,i do a lot of outdoor work a i am a property manager and the ruggedness of the screen and body are appealing to me plus larger battery will help me in the sense that i am not charging or discharging it a much a a regular apple watch battery therefore prolonging the overall battery lifespan longer than a typical apple watch with a smaller battery that get cycled more often throughout it life the louder speaker is also going to be something i am looking forward to a the current speaker is not quite loud enough in certain situation outdoors
6336,can not afford the watch but i love the drawing tho
6337,can you do an every day carry video
6338,mkbhd are you left handed i am just wondering since you are wearing the watch on your right hand d
6339,amiddle of nowhere
6340,you can do the same thing battery wise with a galaxy watch 5 pro for way le money
6341,unfortunately it is ugly compared to the normal one instead of offering a round version they stick to the rectangular shape and now release this with so obsious bezel and that ugly button
6342,thanks for the review what happened to you hand though
6343,cool
6344,man really said it is rewind time at the beginning
6345,800dollar watch hmmmm
6346,if it come to it somebody could make clip on color changing thin case
6347,being that i am not trying to be in the apple ecosystem i am looking forward to a pixel watch ultra for great battery life and bonus
6348,you r living in 2055
6349,personally i think a garmin watch would be better for battery life and overall ruggedness although i have i have not used both the watch so take this with a grain of salt
6350,been a garmin user for year training and running marathon averaging 8 hour of gps running per week yearly the battery life would feel like such a compromise my garmin 945 need charger once every 10 11 day
6351,are you making a review about the series 8
6352,dude your video have stepped up a level unreal editing favourite youtuber out there by far
6353,broooooo why do not you just put your watch in left handed mode lol
6354,if i am spending over dollar500 for a watch it is not going to be on one that will be obsolete and phased out of any update or support in a few year i will take an automatic or mecha quartz and just wear a cheap tracker on the other wrist i mean really you are spending dollar800 on feature that do not matter even when i go hiking i have a garmin on my gear and a seiko on my wrist every time i go with someone who wear a smartwatch at some point they ask hey uh what time is it my watch died
6355,every year the review all sound the same just the product change
6356,1 00 this wa sick
6357,they just did the ultra so they could skip the 9 and go straight to 10
6358,titanium is used in many watch mainly for it lightness a well a it strength
6359,great video you made sure that watch wa filthy in every sun drenched shot do you ever wipe down the glass beautiful watch but i will never push it to it is limit regular watch for me
6360,love the people that just get the product that is suitable for them it is not always the pro or max or even plus version of a product which is ok just do not be the guy that complains about the biggest model when there is lower option also
6361,excellent thorough and informative video yet again thank you
6362,whatever u say wont justify the price stop being a apple fan boy
6363,imagine if apple sponsored the video and gave marque a car to get into a crash with
6364,dollar800 that is like r14000 in south africa and i am sure it will sell for r15500 including import tariff
6365,m a bit disappointed before the launch there were rumor of a pro version with a flat design lime the iphones that wa looking sick and i had instant copped one now they bring this in my opinion fat looking ugly thing made for outdoor i got a series 7 stainless 45mm now not the 8 is worth the extra money
6366,my casio give me 2 year of battery life
6367,i understand the watch market but dollar800 is a very steep price tag it is apple tho so that is normal to them and people will find a reason to add it to their everyday life it is not for everyone but there is definitely a market
6368,this is a great review but this is not enough of an upgrade for me being that the design language is too reminiscent of other apple watch i wished they would have made it look more rugged and kept the size around 45mm
6369,i think they are not trying to include these out of the bunch people rather they are upselling to people who would always a prefer a little better like how everyone just want a pro phone even if they do not really need one and yes i think the design is a subtle hint to say yeah i had those extra dollar to spend
6370,when they are desperately trying to make the thinner yoy but decided to go big on rest of the project
6371,it is unbelievable how youtubers take their time to review apple product and let the other company struggling
6372,nah
6373,is it too weird that i want this one just for the battery life
6374,i will never understand this watch it ha everything and more i can not think of anyone who would actually need all the feature the watch offer while it is only running on 2 day battery life there are so many better watch way more customized for what you actually need to use it for while having a battery life of a week or more not to mention the ridiculous price you are paying for it while many other brand offer better and cheaper
6375,i am still not understanding why you need watch if you have good phone totally useless thing to have
6376,i have pre booked this beast
6377,you forgot people like me or the category that i belong to i have been in the ecosystem from the day of the iphone 4 i own an iphone a macbook pro an ipad airpods and i used to have an imac but apple can not sell me the watch yet why i do not want to charge it or worry about charging it every 2 day my 10 year old casio still work just fine and i changed the battery like 3 time during those 10 year the battery cost dollar2 5 and guess what i did it myself
6378,dope tech
6379,always on display is not a feature for a niche audience on a watch a much a i like apple is implementation of the display that turn on only when you flick your wrist it is not a nice way to check time at a glance once you start having it there is no going back to the old technology it is also much nicer when you are talking to someone to be able to glance in a discreet way without making it look like you are bored or in a hurry to stop the conversation
6380,there is one more class of people the one who want the latest and greatest from apple they are not pro in the normal sense of the word but they need top of the line device because of just who they are and the fact that they have money to spare it those people who buy the pro display xdr stand or the mac pro wheel those who buy macbook pro just to run gmail on it i think this group is going to be the majority even more than the extreme athlete
6381,69 nice
6382,apple watch ultra pro dollar1299 hahaha
6383,so he is telling me to pick one up got it thank you
6384,you do not burn 2k cals not even in the hardest cardio
6385,again i m watiching what i can not afford
6386,i am more like a rund watch guy
6387,that lego bonsai in the background
6388,i think it is the first watch that can actually replace a phone if you really do not want to take your phone somewhere especially if you have wireless earbuds in yeah a lot of smartwatches can make call but they do it rather poorly with poor reception and you can not really send message from them seamlessly
6389,unfortunately the software is really limiting
6390,those intro graphic are cleeaaan
6391,where is the awesome intro everyone is talking about
6392,one other category the person who doe not want to be charging another device each day
6393,it is clear that they created this watch to compete with the like of garmin watch is they have both similar feature and price point with it being targeted towards pro athlete and outdoors is people i think the apple watch look better but i would rather go with garmin who ha ton of experience with creating watch that can take a reliable beating if i ever needed it for such activity
6394,my man just burned 2000 kcal like it is nothing
6395,this review seems more like an infomercial for the apple watch ultra
6396,only gon na get it if they make a newer model i have the series 4 and my only complaint is that battery life doe not last very long especially when the day involves any sporting activity or the like and i want to see people is reaction to it after a few month a year passed
6397,i have the series 6 a full battery can barley get me 12 hour sometimes le
6398,idk why a diver would buy a watch that can not be repair or in 3 year you will have to throw it away and buy a new one because the battery life inevitably tank ik diver that own watch for decade even pas them down to their kid these watch are basically planned obsolescence
6399,fyi the new action button can be mapped to the shortcut app which open it up to being used for almost anything you can build a shortcut for
6400,probably next year there will be 4 version se watch 9 watch 9 pro watch 9 ultra
6401,now apple is just getting greedy
6402,delightful review
6403,is not the surrounding bezel huge in display coverage it like series 7 going back to series5 and 2years down the time we have slightly larger display in the same form factor how doe california apple watch face look on ultra
6404,nice to finally see a real review of the ultra thanks
6405,i want mgrs a well a the 1 million plus people in the military thanks
6406,some folk like me do not even require an apple watch not just an apple watch but any kind of smart watch
6407,please review the new airpods debating which mode i should get the embargo period should be done by now
6408,love the drawing and circling the people out a target user do add small detail like these more often
6409,amazing intro
6410,nothing to see here folk just apple charging a watch for the same price a a flagship phone
6411,look too big on skinny wrist
6412,i like it do not need the feature and will be keeping my s series 7
6413,it is a pipboy
6414,so how doe it perform for extreme sport like expedition diving and marathon w gps on just the capability n ruggedness alone doe not make it an extreme sport watch doe it last more than a day w gps on for expedition if not how can this cater for extreme sport if the battery life can last for few day for normal activity for god sake make the watch more appealing
6415,i have never heard of a pro marathoner but i have heard of ultra marathon there is the term ultra sport and sure there is plenty of pro sport but apple would to want to claim the pro moniker on a watch a it might suggest that it is fur professional athlete or for professional sport sport engaged in by professional athlete nope ultra is exactly what this watch is targeted to those who go beyond normal athletic activity that is not me and so i am perfectly happy to keep closing out my ring daily on the stationary cycle or on a casual hike or jogging with my series 7 i would not need the ultra edition and apple would not suggest i wear it but there is a big audience of folk farther along the scale toward the ultra sport end who would want the feature extra ruggedness end capability of this watch and apple made it for them and that is just awesome
6416,good point on the shape of the watch comparing it to a wrist watch with a watch shape
6417,i almost bought this watch upgraded to the series 8 instead will pick up version 2
6418,doe it have the selection for reverse crown orientation
6419,industrial maintenance technician here the ruggedness alone is what is making me want to upgrade i am not an elite athlete but the job i do demand a lot of physical work my heart rate is definitely up on a daily basis and i am averaging 20k step a day according to my current watch also definitely grabbing the dollar4 99 month apple care plan cause this watch will be used in a not so friendly watch place
6420,feature aside i am more interested in the durability of the watch i use my current apple watch everyday for workout but for work i work on the field and my current watch is beat up if the ultra can survive tough work environment then i am all for it
6421,let get marque brownlee over 100 million subscriber we can do it
6422,good review in my opinion the apple watch ultra is ugly a hell and just one color oh boy still waiting for the apple watch with a flat screen in black
6423,you actually think the calorie counter is legit and 2 and a half day on a fucking watch that doe almost nothing besides track step and heart rate and you are praising it you are delusional
6424,that is the first time i had noticed you had a severe accident because of your hand scar
6425,apple did a great job with the ultra i can not wait to get my hand on it next improvement should be going solar and something awesome for the gamers
6426,1 that intro wa sick 2 i notice that you are on theater mode is that something you have on all the time would that lengthen the battery life while reducing the functionality something most people would not want to do with this watch
6427,i think theater mode just shuts off always on and silence notification so it save a little bit of battery from the always on when you are playing ultimate frisbee and will not be looking at your watch but still want to track your performance
6428,regular high end watch battery life v smart watch is not even comparable idk why you did that obviously smart watch component need more power than a regular watch because they can do way more thing
6429,only middle class will buy that can not make me give up my sub or gmt for that s t
6430,love this review i always watch your review an apple product thank you also love the lego pink leaf bosnia tree in the background i have one on my work desk with the green leaf
6431,this watch ha an absolutely enormous pull for me a an astronomer it ha a red filter for the display which is absolutely crucial for astronomy to protect night vision my current apple watch if i accidentally tilt my wrist kill my night vision however the biggest reason is the waypoint marker often u astronomer need to travel far and to remote location to find darker sky my closest dark sky area is beautiful but ha absolutely zero signal of any degree and can be pretty easy to get lost something like the waypoint marker if accurate and reliable would massively increase my confidence and enjoyment traveling to remote site and further my enjoyment of astronomy
6432,you should try farming fenix 6 solar mine last for 2 week at a time and it ha way point and gps capability
6433,imagine being an astronomer lol
6434,with this battery life
6435,pentox 1999 my adollardollar millennials be like
6436,alind tahir i dare you i double dare you mf jules winnfield
6437,what is the keyboard model in the people demographic depiction doodle shot
6438,the fact you can map the action button to a flashlight is the reason i will buy this watch but only once there is a polished version
6439,most useless overpriced watch of all time
6440,day 1 of asking for an mkbhd house tour
6441,please moisture your arm
6442,what is even pprro in a watch 8 09 like if you are one of these people on the outside here earning tesla plaid reviewing them describing how fluid the dashboard screen are of all the thing in a car that is then you are a pprro and you needed a watch pprro worth it for those of you in the inside of the circle guy you should know now nah
6443,is that a brain design on your t shirt or something else
6444,i feel like apple changed the pro to ultra in the week before the apple event because of the galaxy watch pro and samsung poking at apple lol
6445,how is battery life so bad compared to other smart watch it the only thing keeping me from getting an apple watch competitor have more than twice the battery life
6446,yeah you are right it doe look like a block have not been able to put my finger on why i dislike the design so much but yeah the profile is so box looking not that nice
6447,i still wear a silver moto 360 gen1 turn out i care more about look than anything else and i still have not found another watch that look premium but doe not stand out and i love the lack of a bezel
6448,sometimes i feel your video capture apple product better than apple ad themselves and you are outshining your editing skill every single time
6449,people that buy stuff like this are stupid fact
6450,marque been dailying 2 watch
6451,why did you change the watch from one wrist to the other
6452,the apple watch ultra is geared to those that will actually use those extreme feature
6453,still waiting for the galaxy watch 5 pro review you said you would do
6454,the world rn crumbling global financial system recession incoming potential of a few more war internationally and joblessness at all time high apple how about we create a watch that is dollar800
6455,69percent battery nice i could not agree more when he said that lol
6456,quick question where can i watch you play frisbee that dive to catch the disc wa insane
6457,ahhh yes finally here
6458,watch sud b round ima iphone user using huawei gt 2 pro it last more than 10 day good battery and look good
6459,damn the intro
6460,watch se is still better for huge crowd of people
6461,unfortunately i will not be able to watch this video co no download option marque turned off the download option i do not have time to watch it and i usually download it and watch it later but no download this time so no watching
6462,when i wa watching intro with animation i heard low battery sound of airpods and legit thought that my airpods are low on power took me a second to realize that sound wa actually in the video u got me there mkbhd nice job
6463,worth it or not absolutely not
6464,funny that even though watch ultra is supposed to be for those special consumer regular people will be the main buyer and apple know it
6465,the production and editing is insane keep up the good work
6466,my garmin fenix get 9 day of battery just saying apple watch ultra the pick me girl of adventure watch
6467,personally i could never understand the appeal of apple is watch never had any need whatsoever for such a watch it just feel like some useless technology and the iphones also became appealing with iphone 13 onwards
6468,any emts use apple watch how useful is it when you need to see second what is your setup how is the battery
6469,ishit wa a shit
6470,if someone say international orange once more
6471,that intro look close to an official apple watch ultra trailer nice job
6472,i just can not wait to see how it performs in the world
6473,battery life sound like my ticwatch pro 3
6474,my biggest complaint is that apple changed some of the watch face to look better on the ultra but i hate how it look on my series 7 same with the new iphone home screen but none of that ha anything to do with your review for me i work in road construction painting line on the road dealing with traffic paint solvent and the reflective glass bead among other thing wa a horrible environment for my aluminum series 3 i got the series 7 for myself last christmas in stainless steel and i have been loving it the stainless is much easier to clean then aluminum and scratch a lot le the larger screen is amazing too for me it is perfect it wa a dollar1 263 cad watch but it wa exactly what i needed with some extra goody the ultra would be just shy of a dollar1 400 watch with a lot of feature i frankly do not need it look slick but just is not for me but for those who were looking for that longer battery life and more rugged construction this is the watch for them great video a usual
6475,absolutely no one not a single micro organism marque i wore an apple watch to the met gala
6476,i bet a video of you scuba diving would get 30 million view lol
6477,ticwatch pro 3 still better
6478,it is still really annoying though that you have not tried a garmin or coros watch they do what most people need with still better sport feature while the battery can last week it is just insane the comparison ha not been made
6479,6 31 why is the lighting of the shot so weird especially on the knuckle mkbhd
6480,that intro animation wa sick
6481,another apple money grab make an ultra version for almost dollar1000 and just make the series 8 basic i really hoped they made the series 8 with a different exterior design i guess next year will be better for apple watch fan
6482,this look way too rugged and i am more into classy stuff so probably i am gon na take series 8 this year
6483,actually the new compass feature is not just in the series 8 ultra it is also on my series 7
6484,worth it if you can get an open box at best buy
6485,buy huawei instead of this expensive watch
6486,super excited to get one for myself i travel a lot and looking for something durable lovely intro by the way
6487,i love doing outdoorsy stuff so this sounded like the perfect watch for me i ended up getting the series 7 since ultra wa too expensive and you can not really dress it up silver and orange doe not work with a suit period but also because they are updating s7 with the same compass stuff plus i can not use lte with my carrier so i might a well just get the gps version of 7 for cheap though i love the bigger battery life and that wa my largest hang up for apple watch in the past at the end of the day i do not know any other apple watch user who have complained about it i suppose i will just charge my watch overnight like other people do haha
6488,i would make a bracelet that would allow to use the watch in landscape it would look smaller on the wrist probably look better with the crown on top and it would be more ergonomic to use
6489,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6490,the watch is rated for 100 foot or 40 meter not 100 meter please fix your talking point
6491,they should of just made it 1600 dollar and put a dynamic island or a notch on it too cause there gon na not be able to keep it on the shelf it is still a apple watch just like the apple phone is just a phone i have iphone 13 pro max and i am not buying anything else from apple till they know how to get rid of the dang notch or dumb island i do everything on my note 20 ultra and only message with my iphone cause you can not do anything with a iphone
6492,apple just wanted dibs on the ultra naming which probably mean great thing are on the horizon for the ultra
6493,middle of nowhere
6494,doe not play nice when in an environment that ha water splashing on it fine submerged but not with water splashing on the face
6495,just waiting on a leather strap and my tax but on a another note did you guy notice apple finally put a lock on your hidden folder in the gallery they are making all the right move this year
6496,a the premium offer of apple watch that will already be enough incentive for most ultra buyer even if they only use it to set timer voice command
6497,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6498,yup that is who it will sell to
6499,so he ended up buying one afterall the video of his first impression wa just for him to have enough money from view so that he can purchase one lmao
6500,the design is awesome though finally witnessing a new design wa a dealbreaker to me i have kept my series 4 for so long and it shattered during a dance practice i waited long enough to get a watch i know will last me year to come which is why i went with the ultra it also get incredibly cold where i am when i go for long walk when it is 25c 13f i am expecting my watch to follow my macro so excited to try it out
6501,the only reason i do not use apple watch is 1 2 day battery life this is ridiculous
6502,pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro
6503,tank pressure monitoring not a priority for most technical diver
6504,i actually love the look of this watch never been a fan of the apple watch look in general they look like my grandma is watch but this one actually ha some character
6505,im confused did you burn 1700 calorie in your 3 hour frisbee session
6506,would you say we can leave the phone at home now
6507,the term ultra is frequently used in extreme sport like ultra marathon or ultra triathlon they are targeting the right audience with that title the majority of their customer segment us the watch to run pro is becoming redundant in my opinion
6508,nice
6509,i think i am going to wait for the ultra 2 or if they actually make a pro
6510,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6511,me at the beginning of the video i do not think i have ever burned 2000 calorie in one day in my entire life
6512,lol in our country it is priced over 1000dollar
6513,my impression is that there is an apple watch pro that we do not know
6514,apple watch ultra by samsung
6515,dollar800 for a rolex watch yes a a apple watch nah
6516,how many time do you keep switching your hand to wear the watch do you really wear it on both hand or wa that just for this video
6517,dude never have a girlfriend you will loose your life
6518,in europe the price surpasses 1000euros dollar and i think that the 200 plus might change the value proposition of this ultra watch
6519,i charged my garmin fenix 6 pro 11 day ago and have 10 more day to go obviously when i use all the function i can not go 21 day
6520,people complain about getting microchipped in future and then end up wearing an apple watch even when they sleep smh
6521,i just do not need it
6522,i ride frequently and often about 60 100 daily mile sometime for a week or so i like to use strava on my watch to record the route and health metric and i will get just about a full day on my series 6 after a day of gps tracking i ordered the ultra a i did not want the pressure to have to always charge it everyday or dying on me at the end of the day i will probably keep the series 6 for day when i need something more stealthy
6523,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6524,gps tracking on my series 7 watch is not accurate enough when i am riding thinking the watch ultra would fix that
6525,i guess the reason why apple call it ultra is because it is not a mainstream a the other pro model it is only for the few people who are into these extreme sport hence the reason why it is really expensive for a smartwatch and called ultra instead of pro
6526,loving the intro
6527,came out right on time i am intrigued by this watch
6528,please review the se 2 mkbhd
6529,seeing the watch on his right hand make my eye hurt
6530,tbh this watch is look stupid large even on a giant like marque
6531,which hand should men wear their watch
6532,i will wait for the dollar25 chinese clone currently wearing a plasticky q25 that track my physical activity measure my o2 saturation my temperature and ha a battery that last a week
6533,where is that falcon heavy shirt from
6534,dollar800 for something that look like a cheap silver import do better apple
6535,hi from the uk
6536,epic graphic and editing
6537,ask for your iphone or android phone ihave nothing to buy
6538,perfect watch review doe not exist marque hold my watch
6539,i think it make sense that the ultra doe not come in black yet black would lessen the recognizability of the watch in public because this is a whole new product line apple need it to stand out and catch the eye so word of mouth can do it is thing i am guessing that once the average person know what the ultra is we will get our more discreet color scheme public reaction now is that a giant apple watch public reaction if black wa available now public reaction when black is introduced later is that a black apple watch ultra thought
6540,the reason i will not be buying the watch is because it requires an iphone in order to set up there is no way i am buying a phone in order to setup a watch
6541,am i the only one who think dollar800 for a freaking watch is ridiculous
6542,hey i am a diver from maldives looking for a good dive computer and need honest review it seems to be you can not review diving can anyone suggest me any honest reviewer for me
6543,god tier editing
6544,samsung should sue for the ultra name apple pretty ballsy to name it thay
6545,is the airpods pro 2 review incomming today
6546,the problem with you fool is that when apple price jack the s out of their product u fool run n buy it than other company do the same and now u hyper over inflate a product worth dollar100 or le for dollar800
6547,0 16
6548,whoa nice ultra what do you do hike run a marathon or dive person who doe not do any of them please leave
6549,the met gala reference again i count about 3 now
6550,ask for your iphone or android phone bro
6551,they should have called it the apple watch pro max
6552,i see that i can exchange it for a non ultra band i ordered mine i am very excited to receive it
6553,finally found a smart watch that i can bring into the mosh pit but can also work with my daily fit
6554,0 10 goddamn
6555,imagine if apple replace pro with hardcore
6556,0 10 did i just hear god damn
6557,the answer is more simple to get those fringe people i am an android user if they want me to have an apple watch make it work with android
6558,apple wan na be a ultra man
6559,my point exactly who care it wa made for extreme sport it work good for me
6560,went to sleep with about 69percent percent battery nice man of culture fr
6561,i am surprised at how easily he sent a text with the watch
6562,i work in the oil field so i feel like i need the rugged watch but if i break a 800 dollar watch or a 299se is a big difference
6563,those who need a specialized gear should get a specialized dedicated gear not do it all device such a for diver a for hiker you will be lost once battery is dead you really want a dedicated handheld gps device
6564,which laptop is that at 3 44 7 09 9 43 10 36
6565,my thought throughout the video
6566,so many other better watch that cost this much not worth it not even close if we are being honest
6567,lol that battery life is still a joke
6568,apple is starting to become a tech company where product name are going to be confusing apple w2049 ue oao1029 0202021 x v 2 0 1 will be the upgraded version of the w2049 ua oa01029 0300020 x v 2 0 1 1 but only in europe and they will soon start putting sticker with impossibly to remove glue remains on all their product too
6569,i am looking forward to getting mine a a soldier in the army and a scuba diver i am looking forward to the feature set the night mode with red will be awesome for our field training exercise
6570,i love how often marque brag about getting away with wearing the apple watch at the met gala
6571,the intro wow
6572,ultra sound like samsung
6573,best one
6574,what ever happened to the rumored blood glucose monitoring
6575,sick intro a always
6576,i feel like so many people miss that garmin make watch and there hand down better for outdoor enthusiast
6577,i dunno what it wa about that intro but it wa fire
6578,the spec is good for my liking
6579,bro my fitbit last like two week
6580,question is the prominent vibration setting on the ultra stronger feeling than the other apple watch
6581,first they went after the normal smartwatch market which eventually ate up all the rolex type luxury watch now they are going after gshock fitbit
6582,that is quite the scar may i ask what happened
6583,i just got ta say that your production value keep going up and yall should be super proud of yourselves
6584,great review a usual big hug from portugal
6585,how did you get that scar in your hand
6586,i really like the watch but will never buy it
6587,two year ago i bought a coros over an apple watch because i need battery life for 12 hour plus run if an apple watch could do 13 15 hour of activity run time i would totally be interested my worry though is that it would only do that for one year then the next year it might only do 10 hour then on year three only 8 hour etc
6588,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6589,lean on me how come you are wearing the watch on your right hand do not get me wrong i am a right hand watch wearer but can see the tan line on your other wrist
6590,pretty poor stitching on that hand buddy
6591,when i bought my first and only apple watch this presentation is what i wa expecting to be able to do with it
6592,what is a channel that would scuba dive with this watch or mountain bike i would like to know that perspective
6593,the ultra 2 will come in black n graphite and possibly blue
6594,tell me when it will become finally pairable with android phone
6595,could they have made the apple watch ultra black probably but anodizing titanium is a bit of a pain titanium doe not like to do that stuff in fact it doe not like to do a lot of thing for the reason it is such a good material for constructing thing that need to stand up to abuse
6596,i wan na buy it then i realize i do not go outside that often should i wear one at home
6597,admittedly i thought the apple watch ulta wa awesome definitely overkill for me but awesome i really wanted that wayfinder watch face luckily apple wa gracious enough to update th apple watch series 7 to include the new compass that the ultra ha so now i have backtrack and waypoints too it is super cool
6598,a someone who like a bigger face watch all my automatic are jealous for the amount of wear my apple watch get i upgraded exclusively for the new battery life and the larger ruggedized look i did not realize this existed until after launch and now i have to wait until november to get it lol
6599,0 00 duration of watch 1 15 it is ultra not pro 2 48 b roll unboxing 3 08 ruggedness feature battery 3 54 build quality 5 51 battery amp capability 6 33 the orange action button 8 06 who is this watch for 8 22 for diver 9 10 for hiker 10 13 for endurance athlete 10 54 battery optimization 11 46 watch band 12 22 review from different people 12 47 marque review
6600,hey mk eagerly waiting on the fold review do not why it this delayed need to make a purchase decision your review would go a long way in my decision
6601,use huawei watch you can use at least 1week in a single charge
6602,the cinematography of mkbhd vids are sooooo good
6603,did they made this watch david goggins proof
6604,these editor are so damn good
6605,just realized marque is left handed
6606,i thought about how you would dress it down and yeah either you would want to try a nice leather band with it to see if that work or have it stick out a lot especially under a sleeve lol am i still going to try yep
6607,dollar1300 australian for half the feature and half the battery of even last year galaxy watch 4 classic that cost dollar600 also for that price you could get a garmin fenix 7 saphire lmao never seen such a ridiculous and useless overpriced turd in my life so glad i dumped apple i also knew the series 8 would be literally identical to the series 7 with 3 week battery lol somehow apple ha conditioned it is base into accepting the same junk year after year and believing it is new it is a cult
6608,tag heuer have a black titanium smart watch
6609,legit canceling my order after watching this lol
6610,do se2
6611,this prof once again the stainless steel series 8 need to be reduced in price dollar749 plus for the s s8 and the ultra is dollar799 are too close in price
6612,hoping the series 9 will just be the regular apple watch but the bigger screen a someone who is 6 3 with bigger wrist even the 45mm look silly
6613,that intro felt like scene from black mirror so good
6614,honestly i kinda want a full on computer on my wrist like a gauntlet computer or a pipboy something absolutely massive that can straight up replace my phone p
6615,you could get a new damn phone for that dollar800 price tag apple and other company that sell watch for that price must be nut
6616,of course nah a chinese step tracker is all you need ever
6617,0 09 goddamn
6618,i bought this watch for one reason surfing ocean paddling text response the current apple watch are awful when wet hopefully this is fixed with the ultra
6619,take away all the gimmick that your normal average person doe not do consistently like diving and hiking just add in the big battery and better display but lower the price and this would be worth it other than that it is really overpriced like many of apple product usually are
6620,complete overkill for me so yeah i will be ordering it
6621,apple watch ultra beyond the wallet
6622,it is fairly cheap for american
6623,i am really looking forward to getting the apple watch ultra
6624,my theory is ultra is a new terminology on ultra high end like m1 ultra so maybe a macbook ultra someday or even leaving open a apple watch pro later which fall between the standard apple watch and the watch ultra maybe a watch pro future apple watch edition model
6625,a an avid cyclist i had to switch to garmin a apple watch doe not have ant connectivity and the gps feature for cycling tracking are still terrible even on the ultra
6626,i will just wait for the apple watch ultra se
6627,really like your expression in the product review hugely informative and useful
6628,first
6629,i have never been into smart watch and i am an android guy but i actually really like the look of this watch
6630,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6631,i am an android guy a well and i honestly did not think i would be into having a smartwatch either but i recently hit 41 and my dr said i need to keep track of my heart rate being on new med so i went online looked for review and picked up a cheap letsfit iw2 and it is been great a a basic smartwatch with 10 day battery life i think apple watch are overkill for most people
6632,it is certainly an impressive watch but i think most people will get it purely for the battery and increased screen brightness hopefully this trickle down to the regular watch in the future
6633,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6634,yet we will still see kid wear it and find way to break it lol
6635,the only thing i need apple to do with their watch is to allow you to stop and restart a workout from the crown it is not user friendly having to swipe to pause a workout
6636,merci from montreal keep up the good work
6637,is there a reason why you are wearing it on your right wrist
6638,the reason why i do not use an apple watch is because i am an android user we are the segment apple is never going to reach a long a they keep their stuff in a walled garden
6639,5 55 is that the lego bonsai tree in the background
6640,13 06 bro not playin wit yall
6641,i will wait till the next generation of the watch i need more battery life
6642,gon na be looking like ben10 with my small wrist
6643,ok here we go
6644,what an intro salute
6645,i like it with that orange band i need it because the size is right i feel my 7 is just too small
6646,anytime i want new tech or see the latest stuff the channel is my go to
6647,i really do not understand how people put up with watch that have to recharged multiple time a week the pebble and amazfit have 30 day battery life all with running heart rate and sleep monitoring all at dollar50 they want to me to pay 16x more for worse battery life a screen i will almost never look at and having to shout into my wrist hard pas
6648,eda monu kidilam video
6649,i wish apple watch come in surgical stainless steel finish made from titanium
6650,the people outside the circle are those who can not afford any apple watch
6651,dollar800 no nada not worth it at all let is do an actual breakdown of actual usefulness of any other feature other than telling time for an item that just mostly sits there and display a time most use their similarly priced phone it is a huge waste of money i put this in the same category a owning a fancy rolex that doe the exact same thing a a citizen
6652,cool watch tan i have got one just like it
6653,that scar tho
6654,while one wear a automatic watch whether a lux swiss or others youll never have to worry abt batt life ir charging and contarily smart watch big caveat is the battery life so why not make a automatic self charging smart watch
6655,seriously is there anybody using an apple watch to participate at a triathlon
6656,i do not think that even olympic athlete that are in camp burn 4 000 calorie a day but ok
6657,thanks for watching
6658,marque talking about apple watch by the way i wa at met gala and wore one
6659,great review one question what about the face available for this watch is possible to use the one we already know from the regular series are those available for this watch
6660,yes it ha all the previous face excluding the herm s specific one but including all of the nike face that were previously exclusive to the aw nike model which are now a thing of the past it appears so quite a lot of face many with multiple variation including some older one that have been updated with the larger widget that were introduced with the infograph face on aw s4 and or colorized widget on face that could only use b amp w widget previously
6661,lol love the stick figure population diagram
6662,what happened to his hand he ha a long scar
6663,marque look totally normal on your wrist just get used to it my first watch wa 30mm round cassio and i thought it is massive but over time i started to wear different watch and now my first cassio look soooo tiny to me
6664,i am getting the apple watch ultra for my birthday in january
6665,i wear my aw on my right wrist for it usefulness a activity tracker and various item while traveling i have my explorer on my left wrist a my watch left in my home timezone it ha worked well for a couple of year i think what the ultra get right is the double battery life this allows it to be what it aesthetic implies a wrist computer i will now be able to leave my iphone at home a i will be able to use aw ultra a an iphone replacement which is what i think it really is my explorer may also stay home with my iphone
6666,is marque left handed also is the way you interact with the digital crown not awkward flip the watch so the crown is on the other side and action button easier to press with your thumb
6667,that intro wa amazing
6668,ja rule intro song fast and the furious anyone
6669,doe anyone know the name of the wallpaper 1 50
6670,definitely bought now
6671,new button will cost you just 800dollar
6672,definitely not suitable for slim and slender people
6673,from a marketing point of view pro would not be a good name pro should be for professional use the apple watch ultra is not for professional but different kind of enthusiast
6674,god damn lool
6675,this channel ha become one of apple is biggest advertising channel you will never see a negative review here is all great and amazing and spectacular with the occasional room for improvement or or what i would like like to see on a next version kind of veiled criticism no one want to lose a good job this dude included always great visuals impeccable editing and smooth talking but review no this is an ad channel and a very good one at that let no one be fooled by what they are actually viewing
6676,i bet it is still terrible to record you on a treadmill my series 6 is so trash unless i run outside super annoying cuz my ring do not close and calorie always way off
6677,any plan on comparing this watch to my current garmin fenix 6 7
6678,forget the watch i wa focused on that big beautiful screen in your car
6679,i understand that the frisbee practice doe not use gps
6680,worth it
6681,on my galaxy watch 5 i get 2 full day and night without a charge
6682,overkill for most of u if series 9 keep all it existing feature and just adopts the flat screen i will finally upgrade
6683,i want to buy airpods pro gen 2 when do you do a review of them
6684,dope intro one of the best from mkbhd review a always to the point and honest
6685,for me i wa already considering the titanium version of the normal watch but wa waiting for the 8 before buying when this wa announced at the same price done pre ordered one
6686,but a dive computer need button you tried without gps which kill every watch basically it is a what in case of nothing more
6687,242 000 view within 47 minute of posting wow on fire
6688,i agree ultra seems like an odd description of what it is i think apple should have called it by it nature the apple wrist clock
6689,can it handle salt water
6690,3 day is battery is mediocre against garmin watch
6691,best review ever
6692,i am not a native english speaker and i am curious around 3 32 marque say button that do not have quite a much travel what doe he mean by to have travel in this case
6693,how deep do they go before they click
6694,00 16 nice
6695,i switched to a garmin fenix series because i got tired of charging the apple watch every night the day when you forget to charge or do not have access to a charger mean you have a one day watch the fenix ha a 3 week battery with basic function but the screen display is not a nice maybe this watch would be nice if it had a lower battery mode to stretch it out to a week or so
6696,is this video sped up to 1 1x i think
6697,marque what is your wrist circumference so we can picture the ultra on u based on your wrist shot
6698,it is like a tv on your arm
6699,great review nice catch
6700,i wish it would track how many slice of pizza i had at planet fitness pizza friday is
6701,one niche segment that is likely bigger than any of the sport oriented one you and apple have mentioned is the large watch wearer there are million of people that simply found all other apple watch too small period nothing else this watch is for them next you have people like me the new styling is one of the strongest selling point flat display being key i could have done with 46mm but it is the style nonetheless and of course the obvious battery life watch ultra is going to sell like crazy if initial availability condition are any indicator
6702,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6703,after 23 min
6704,in europe it is euros999 then the 800 doe not sound that bad anymore
6705,i need to see a no iphone only watch vid to see how long it last because other cellular apple wachtes do not even last half a day sometimes i do not want to bring my phone but still want to listen to music and be available for a emergency like when i run to and back from football practice
6706,1lth comment
6707,amogus
6708,2k calorie for 3 hr ultimate frisbee is likely wrong tracking
6709,soon ultra
6710,2 40 so at this point in time we have got the egg soft boiled egg
6711,yo marque how would you get that gnarly scar i have one very similar
6712,i remember buying the first apple watch with the milanese band and that wa 749 if i remember correctly so for this being about 50 buck more than that getting all this with the type of quality it is a steal in comparison
6713,that thing look like 2006
6714,pro might be reserved for an upcoming iwatch and thus ultra
6715,would love to see a ultimate frisbee highlight video of you
6716,the way you laid out 13 07
6717,maybe someone already asked and it totally offtopic but whats that cool scar on your hand from if you do not mind asking
6718,marque showing off his insane drawing skill with stick figure xd
6719,keeping aside the whole apple tax when it come to smartwatches apple is year ahead now with this it is decade ahead
6720,ultra is likely to be the new price tier for apple is product in multiple category apple watch is typically used to introduce new feature that eventually make their way to other product line like aod why not new price tier a well
6721,for ruggedness all you said is it is bigger that ha nothing to do with being rugged how is it more rugged
6722,over kill is good better to have it and no need it etc
6723,i definitely want one i have the series 4 i use a casio g shock type case for it
6724,the intro
6725,0 16 nice
6726,i still see zero appeal to apple over priced watch how anyone is sucked into buying it is beyond me
6727,imagine driving to frisbee practice in a tesla
6728,when it can last at least week on a single charge i might consider one i will stick with my garmin until then
6729,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6730,when the garmin becomes a useful smartwatch i might get one
6731,that is a very good point i bought a 7 last year but the battery circus is annoying a week is worth should be the bare minimum
6732,maybe another 5 7 year from now
6733,editing is improving day by day
6734,wearing skinny jean in the middle of nowhere
6735,where did you get that t shirt
6736,another great review marque however i too wish for a black version i do not think it would scratch any different i wear my galaxy watch 5 pro which is matte black and also made of titanium and sapphire glass apple should have made that color just like samsung gave u two color option i think i will pas until apple brings black a an option please let them know if you get the chance to atleast add it it will blend in and make the watch look more pleasing thanks again for your content
6737,the design is meant for left hand amp watching him wear the watch on right hand is giving me serious anxiety
6738,that intro alone made me like the video
6739,sheesh that this is so tall and bulky it would look much better with a gshock square esq shape
6740,they need to make a high end luxury version that actually ha extra feature look to differentiate it from the regular watch
6741,maybe they will make a solid gold version which lack the durability of the ti version and is 10x heavier
6742,not really what apple product are like lol
6743,i have not had an apple watch since the series 1 and that had a bad battery i ordered this one because i like having the top end model the battery and size also sold me
6744,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6745,this right here this is exactly what i am talking about 99percent of people buying this are buying it for the battery and because it is something new from apple
6746,marque is the tech man i will be getting mine on friday new order are delivering on october 27 and later obviously it is selling very well i do expect you to climb mt everest for u to test this watch out
6747,apple can anodize the metal for matte black watch
6748,if it worked with android phone and came in black id consider it a my first smart watch
6749,for a price of a new iphone i guess i will stick to no watch yet for another year
6750,apple is so trash and do not deserve that market cap
6751,nah
6752,20syl
6753,do we still need manual in tech box those are thing that should not be included not charger
6754,my two cent a someone who is into watch specifically mechanical watch this seems to be apple is equivalent of a field watch it is not specialized in any specific task but overall is rugged and can take a beating 100 meter of water resistance actually is not super impressive for a dive watch most dive watch are rated to at least 200 meter apple seems to be borrowing a marketing tactic from the rest of the watch industry by endorsing real athlete and professional so that buyer can feel a little bit closer to their hero rolex with jaques cousteau tag heuer and richard mille in racing omega and the moon landing etc
6755,devon peregrine is the best rec dive computer no discussion possible perdix for tek
6756,tshepiso motsoko i totally agree and i think it is a great tactic it is funny because i always considered apple to be the rolex of the smartphone industry with how they market their brand
6757,the 100m ha an asterisked caveat in the fine print 40m still ok i would imagine
6758,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6759,goreb no look at the original commenter username
6760,i wonder how many time he draw those people to get it right
6761,the apple watch ultra look like it should go well with a silver milanese band
6762,yeah no that watch ha no idea how many calorie you burnt lmao
6763,i am a galaxy owner but tried the aw7 a couple of month back along with the 13 pro max the apple watch make me want to switch
6764,trying to count the number of watch band you change every day
6765,69percent battery nice 0 17
6766,what about the watch5 pro review
6767,i should wait for 2nd version apple watch ultra maybe extra more battery and the black apple watch
6768,is this low grade sapphire
6769,ultra is a new apple category there will be an ultra iphone airpods etc
6770,nice video sir
6771,if you want to compare the apple watch ultra with these other watch do not just point the battery life i am pretty sure that a watch that last more than the awp are not even close to it feature
6772,what an intro
6773,for me i went with the ultra simply because i wa going to buy the series 8 stainless steel version and it is only dollar50 more exactly what apple wa hoping for
6774,1 50 it is so true apple call everything else the pro so it make sense to call this watch the ultra
6775,this is a good option for laborer builder farmer and anybody who prefers more durable tech
6776,easily the worst review so far you just ramble abort the size of the watch for more than half the time instead of actually giving u your thought on the new feature a you used them you are just regurgitating what apple ha already said
6777,6 35 bright international orange coloured button it is even visible from the international space station
6778,this intro is lit
6779,great review
6780,now i know who is making apple event kudos to my man
6781,computer on wrist v computer in pocket aka watch v phone most want a bigger phone so the size argument is not exactly fair
6782,how are you allowed to wear the watch during training what about the risk of injury
6783,checking my youtube feed early this morning assuming the mkb and ijustine review would hit any minute lol
6784,wow
6785,the stick figure analogy wa spot on
6786,2 day of battery is not enough for anything in the forest
6787,will apple make rugged iphone in the future
6788,we need pen and paper demonstration in all review
6789,see shearwater teric thats smaller than apple watch ultra
6790,somehow i am triggered by you wearing the watch on your right hand
6791,i wish apple would make a model that is between the normal version and this one i am extremely happy with my new series 8 though
6792,next year
6793,i do all you did in the intro and i have 12 day left in my garmin fenix
6794,i like how long the battery last
6795,thanks for the real life use of the apple watch ultra i must say i made the right decision pre ordering it woot
6796,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6797,which car wa that you drived
6798,bro turned amazon back into a back drop
6799,they have obviously teamed up with the lady panty liner called always
6800,so the action button can be pushed by accident if you wear the watch on your right arm
6801,it suck that they removed the titanium option from the normal series 8 why the f would they do that i still own a series 4 and wa about to upgrade but i wanted a titanium watch i don t want this huge ugly thing so i will wait for another year
6802,wait i saw a mkbhd logo on your watch nice
6803,apple watch seemed to me toy watch i waited for a larger since i bought my iphone so i am excited to check this on wrist if it ha a more serious look
6804,i did not realize the apple watch had such poor battery my watch 3 classic get 2 full day pretty easily
6805,1 48 i will give it to you for the airpods pro but the other stuff is meant for pro user doing pro photography video editing music production etc the apple watch pro would not be a good name for it because it is not for professional it is for rugged outdoorsman when you think of pro what do you think you think of business suit you think formal even business casual maybe you think none of those thing when you think of what the apple watch ultra is for it is for rugged outdoors not an office setting the outdoors ha nothing to do with pro anything
6806,the dive computer and hiking feature arent a good a the dedicated stuff and wont replace them it only scratch the surface so this is just a more durable longer battery way overpriced apple watch and people will buy it anyway coz apple
6807,if you have a phone which these day could argued to be a necessity do you need another phone strapped to your wrist the world ha exponentially become a want society that disregard the negative of living by that mantra and how adhering to a need mantra would be ecologically better there is so much marketing driven information being disseminated yet so little intelligent information to offer balance
6808,damn just for the battery this seems worth an upgrade
6809,the problem with the ultra is that in europe it priced at 999dollar and that is definitely not worth the price for a few minimal upgrade nothing too significan not regarding battery life also
6810,the intro incredable shoot
6811,i switch from garmin to apple because app had better outdoors capability then garmin for me mainly half of garmin app which also control the watch require data which when you in the middle of no where is not exactly in great abundance so the watch ha 3 different gps system but half of it feature do not work because no data
6812,i just love the way marque just explains thing make life so much easier
6813,one aspect of the apple watch ultra that i think is getting under reported is the change to the screen a flat screen protected by a titanium lip is going to be a lot harder to scratch than the rounded display of the past i have owned four apple watch the series 1 2 4 and 6 even with the sapphire glass every one of them ha been nicked and scratched over the course of normal were now i am a mechanic that always forgets to take his watch off when he is digging in an engine but even reducing that amount of screen damage over time is almost reason enough to buy the ultra at least in my estimation i think that people who do a lot of manual labor will dig the update and see it a a legitimate reason to upgrade
6814,better buy a gpu than a 800dollar watch lmao
6815,huawei make battery stay up to 14 day even in pro model what is the wow factor here in battery
6816,the series 7 is the best value for money since i do not need all that ovulation data
6817,nah indian word
6818,i am still on the outskirt still no way to track a workout if you do a combat sport any kind of wrestling jiu jitsu boxing muay thai mma judo tkd no way to track calorie burned
6819,you switch wrist that often
6820,i love the fact that it is 49 mm big guy love big watch
6821,the most compelling part for me is that it is not really much more expensive for all you get extra a stainless apple watch with their version of a sapphire crystal is already in that territory you might a well get the one that doe it all unless the size is just a no go giant watch are still popular so it is not a striking a you might think but natural titanium is finish is kind of more rugged looking than classy on a watch titanium should anodize well but the color do not pop the same way they do on aluminum i keep looking for a reason to grab a smart watch but still waiting for a key feature like a glucose monitor or something they have made it an interesting device but there is nothing on it i absolutely need for this much money and considering it is outdated in two three year it is just still more of a luxury than a real necessity and i love tech
6822,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6823,glucose monitor apps sync up with health
6824,almost there with the dexcom iphone if the watch paired with the dexcom that would be ideal
6825,mardox they have purchased some tech that potentially can allow it it is likely at some point
6826,they had titanium apple watch in multiple two colour in the year past probably saving the darker coloured one for next year to get people to upgrade also the screen being 2000 nit make for a surprisingly bright flashlight already it ha a special app just for that
6827,probably covered this in your past video but in the intro do you normally use the watch on your right wrist and the on your left for practice i would be so lost if i did that nice job is that for your throw arm being free
6828,i appreciate your honesty amp thoroughness in every single video
6829,that intro wa super dope
6830,the opening animation could be easily mistaken for an apple watch ultra ad such amazing quality
6831,pretty cool
6832,great video i know a bunch of people are going to drop dollar800 just for the battery alone
6833,there is lot of people that live in extreme place and others that work in extreme condition where the regular apple watch will not cut it this is meant for them i think if i wa living out in the wood or working on a fishing boat this is the watch i would want
6834,another apple ad did not talk about the pricing cause it hard to justify
6835,the size may be up to context but both garmin fenix 7 and epix 2 are smaller at 47mm and they are up for discussion the benchmark for the sport fitness smartwatch industry
6836,my question is could you feel the weight difference with it being bigger than others and that circle you draw wa disgusting
6837,watch pro is trademarked by lg electronics inc
6838,even though it is expensive it doe not look good so i will go with the se version only
6839,can you review the galaxy watch 5pro
6840,from where is this awesome keyboard in the video
6841,why do you keep flipping wrist
6842,ohhhhh with the dive slide frisbee catch for the touchdown lolll clean
6843,0 18 just for that you have earned my like and sub
6844,time to start a met gala drinking game
6845,you need a really thick arm to wear this watch
6846,i get you on the dress up or down older guy like me have real watch for that though this will be my daily driver i would also add that there is a group of people that have an off road vehicle with all these capability and never go off roading lol they would absolutely buy this
6847,what about battery life under lte i constantly go on run without my phone and only have my garmin tactic delta track me and play music but would like to stream and track
6848,for some reason i find this one of the funniest video marque ha posted in recent time
6849,what workout mode do you use for ultimate
6850,these video are getting way too good
6851,two thing is not apple watch and ultra too big too play ultimate with i use amazfir gtr 2 and feel soon i am gon na scratch someone is face with it second thing wtf you mean with 2000cal o
6852,i need basically none of the feature on the ultra but i need the regular apple watch to not have screen glass a it bezel that will get smashed the moment i graze a wall or table at any angle
6853,can we just take a moment to appreciate the way mkbhd make title never clickbatey and always descriptive
6854,casually say he wa at the met gala so i have been going to the met gala for a couple of year now
6855,interesting how he wear the watch on the right hand someone told me year back guy usually wear them on the left lady vice versa do not know if that still hold up nowadays
6856,apple product review before the sale date amazing
6857,why is it in theater mode the whole time
6858,that tesla grip is horrible
6859,am i the only one noticing the watch switching back and forth between the left and right hand in the intro that would drive me nut to do that
6860,airpods pro 2 review next please sir
6861,that steering wheel grip
6862,no way in 3 hour you burned 2000kcals in 3 hour highly highly unlikely
6863,i run 2hrs and it burn 1 300kcals so yeah 3hrs should get to 2 000kcals easily
6864,it not much more to go from stainless steel to the ultra made from titanium so yes it is worth it
6865,0 09 did you guy hear that
6866,boo get worse material at this point it will become cinema quality and id waste my entire life watching you
6867,love the lego bonsai tree
6868,i love the video i love the shirt
6869,a a person who really wa not satisfied with the quality and durabity of the aluminium version i have decided that the next one should be stainless steel and i do not know how about u price but boy in poland 45mm stainless steel with a singleloop cost exactly the same avarage polish salary that the ultra doe
6870,you really did not need to do a review repeatedly using the term thing said it all
6871,i am definitely not in the target audience i want it so bad
6872,probably the only apple product that i actually have wanted in year but i am a die hard pixel fan boy so so apple watch for me
6873,my 2dollar watch is gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt
6874,no one seems to be bothered with the wrong unit of calorie burned apple us at 0 08
6875,such a great intro holy
6876,at least the galaxy watch are round and do a good job of trying not to look like a computer on your wrist to this end i would never wear an apple watch with a tux definitely not the new massive pro version of the apple watch
6877,shaq o neal easy
6878,oversized watch are not out of place even a a simple fashion accessory before the smart watch really caught on for wide use i did not buy one until the apple watch 3 i wa wearing large fashion watch it wa actually an adjustment going from bigger watch to such a small light watch some woman also would wear men is sized fashion watch and in my opinion they did not look out of place on a smaller wrist obviously it is up to personal taste how large a watch someone is comfortable wearing i just do not think an individual would need to be self conscious about wearing the larger apple watch after all even though it is a computer on your wrist it is still very much a fashion accessory too
6879,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6880,dive watch are usually 200m rated the 100m is for static depth in a pressure chamber with still water rolling wave motion etc can exceed say a 30m wr rating just swimming normally just because it is 100m rated doe not mean it can reliably dive near that depth
6881,i am pretty sure i read somewhere that they do not recommend going deeper than 40m with it
6882,right wrist wearer so werid
6883,i have absolutely no need for this thing nor any apple watch for that matter but for some reason i still want one so badly
6884,bc you want everyone to see how much money you are ready to waste on a for you useless device
6885,apple marketing thanks you
6886,0 23 i would not necessarily trust what any device say a the amount of calorie you burned during an activity a being accurate i would use it only a a metric for measuring difference and baseline
6887,13 10 that throw wa extremely saisfying
6888,if only apple would put this battery life in the regular series 8 while keeping the same size one can hope
6889,man i wanted to build that lego bonsai set on my channel would you tell me if it is a great set to build btw amazing editing on the video the animation surrounding the watch in the intro are top notch
6890,hey marque lovely presentation and intro just noticed something like a scar in your right hand i never noticed before hope your all right peace
6891,mkbhd be killing me with them intro and beat kudu to the team
6892,watch should always be on the left wrist broo
6893,a smart watch for the same price a an iphone yeah i will pas lol
6894,why not always wear the watch on your left arm
6895,time for carbon watch body so they can be naturally black and not show wear a easily
6896,there is an iphone ultra coming
6897,i am having mine hydro dipped in carbon great video man
6898,wouldnt expect anything le great review
6899,that wa a really beautiful illustration thanks marque lol
6900,i can guarantee the battery life of this watch would not last long enough for me to complete an ironman
6901,which workout do you select for ultimate frisbee
6902,is the dial size 49mm doe not look that big
6903,the 45mm seemed larger than this
6904,you are missing a group first responder they are going to love an apple watch with longer battery life and better durability
6905,air integration and tank pressure monitoring are the same thing the ultra doe not support it
6906,worth it for sure
6907,i think it look like kid is toy so nah
6908,wheres the samsung galaxy watch review
6909,the day that apple or any smartwatch for that matter come with a smooth videocall function i am in for me that is some future stuff right there
6910,in india price is above 1100 usd insane
6911,fantastic way to explain technology great work mkbhd
6912,look at the battery life of actual sport focused smartwatches answer is simple it not even close to being worth it
6913,that is a good point about the shape when i first saw this i thought it wa gigantic then i saw it is the same size a a garmin fenix it is the square shape it doe not look like a typical watch it is so completely irrational but i can not stand square watch

6915,garmin battery life is 20 day what a joke
6916,i do not see it being worth the money the apple watch is bulky the worst thing is a watch that slide on your wrist i can see someone banging it up against the wall pretty easily is the battery removable can it be changed like a g shock tech v functionality
6917,short answer no long answer noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
6918,those who waiting for galaxy watch 5 pro review since marque did impression video
6919,so when it come to the ultra v garmin just an example battery life there are a couple of other thing that help garmin achieve that long battery charge like the screen are very different lcd v a basic transflective display the power need between the two are the far end of the spectrum the new garmin epix 2 only go maybe a few day with normal use apple make a much better everyday smartwatch over garmin disclosure i have a series 7 and a fenix 6 over garmin while i have not tried any of the new touchscreen garmin is however they both have their place i prefer the apple watch right now and have my fenix for when i play golf or go for any hiking i have yet to have tried the new watchos 9 for hiking on the apple watch so i can not compare yet
6920,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy

6924,gt laugh in garmin
6925,what a headache i have been with garmin watch bike computer and bike indoor trainer for the past 7 year and i am super happy with all their product performance yet recently i have switched to apple one i do not need spotify and so when running i can not use it on garmin not to mention listening to an audiobook now i wa thinking to upgrade to garmin fr955 mainly due to hrv running power battery the size i have pretty slim wrist and obviously the data that i have accumulated on garmin connect i know i could transfer it to ie strava but i do not want another company to have my data will wait few more week to see other review from triathletes and than decide thanks for the review a usual very useful
6926,make your wrist bigger not the watch smaller
6927,wait three hour frisbee practice i am living life all wrong
6928,i bought a series 6 last year i always get two full day and night with it i did not know that wa abnormal wonder why i get so much battery life
6929,outstanding review apple should say thanks to you
6930,review galaxy watch 5 pro plzz
6931,i am interested in you getting a check up id like to know if you have had any side effect with all that radiation from the headphone watch and phone the phone is the only thing i use
6932,for example maybe le bone density or loss of muscle mass
6933,22 second into the video and you got me with that surprise nice comment went to bed with 69percent nice well played hd to contain an actual lol cause i am at work and it is super quiet so it woulda been awkward
6934,wait for caviar version of this watch
6935,man what a catch
6936,69 percent battery nice
6937,how many time is this guy going to mention the met gala we get it you are important
6938,2000 cal from throwing frisbee i need to change sport like asap
6939,what bruh but my series 3 last 3days maybe i am not using it enough
6940,owning a pro from apple doesnt make u anything except rich
6941,going to sleep with about 69percent battery nice
6942,the only reason i watch this video is because of video quality and i do not care about any of these stuff apple is going down the hill
6943,no one talk about him being a professional ultimate frisbee player while having a 16m youtube channel
6944,honest feedback really liked your apple watch ultra review but didn t like your 14 is review i think it parcially apple is fault for not making exciting phone this year keep the grind marque
6945,i wish you would try out a garmin for two week and give your opinion
6946,a a watchguy i restrain from buying a garmin despite it being a great tool it a plate on your arm we really do not appreciate anything bigger than that apple watch either
6947,a a watchguy i restrain from buying a garmin despite it being a great tool it a plate on your arm we really do not appreciate anything bigger than that apple watch either
6948,i think it would look cool with classic metal band
6949,not gon na lie i wa kinda hoping to see mkbhd do a triathlon with the watch
6950,i can not really take this review seriously a marque ha not turned on the list view for the apps why would you wan na hunt around a field of blob to find the app you want
6951,i hate the way you hold the steering wheel
6952,another day another opportunity for mkbhd to postpone the discussion about being pro
6953,i am going to buy this and cosplay a a power ranger it is morphing time
6954,i am here for the middle of nowhere enactment lol
6955,i literally see samsung ad at the beginning of all mkbhd video about apple
6956,hell no 800 for that
6957,my garmin is solar powered
6958,your content is upgraded faster than iphone spec
6959,that intro could be an apple commercial
6960,hello what is he referring to a practice probably i did not catch it thank you for response in advance
6961,no smart watch is worth it only moron wear smart watch
6962,marque just need a reason to flex his frisbee skill and the met gala moment jk
6963,dollar800 only in the u though
6964,a a normal person who definitely will not push this watch to it limit the battery life is so tempting but i know i can not justify the price because i will not use a majority of the feature this watch boast i have not ordered one yet and maybe i will maybe i will not but it is so tempting for the wrong reason
6965,pls stop using the devil measurement system
6966,no watch look good at a thin wrist like yours
6967,i wonder if apple could add solar charging to the watch somehow without making the solar panel obvious and ugly would be pretty sweet but i am very much enjoying my series 7 and watch o 9 i did have the series 8 preordered but got cancelled somehow then i saw the deal on the series 7 and had a chance to think about it again and if the minimal change would be worth the extra money so o decided to save a good chunk for a new series 7 and wa able to get that gorgeous blue that the 8 doe not have yet i wa excited for the midnight because it match everything but most of everything i wear anyway match the blue and it is gorgeous also match my iphone 12 great so great video a always marque
6968,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6969,you would need a 400cm2 solar panel which is about 20cm square to make your watch completely charge free that is counting the solar panel getting 8h sun a day if you had one the full size of the watch face still getting 8h a day of light you could increase the time between charge by 8hours each time which is not too bad
6970,what keyboard is he using the keycaps look pretty sweet
6971,you can swim
6972,do a video where you try to make it look formal luxury
6973,if you on gps it will be dead in no time
6974,the video only get better
6975,at this point i mainly watch mkbhd video to see how they are going to up their editing game the product info is just icing on top
6976,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6977,yeah if they actually provide the right info
6978,i found this review to be underwhelming part of the purpose of a review is to test the manufacturer claim and you did not really do much of that with this one you mentioned the professional and referred to the podcast but you really should have just delayed this review give them the watch for a couple of day and get their impression
6979,see mkbhd wearing the watch in right hand make me feel like i aint alone
6980,can the gps tracking be used underground
6981,the intro always make me smile like brooo is so good with it
6982,but it really doe not look crazy big on your wrist which you keep calling slim at all truly
6983,if they made an aluminum case version for like dollar500 or so buck i would buy it problem is that i do not want to pay a phone price for a apple watch
6984,i have a garmin descent mk2i which work with my pixel 6 and with my iphone 13 pro when i had it i would like to try the apple watch ultra but can you use it without an apple phone if not why would not apple benefit from having million of android user buying the apple watch
6985,we need a what doe mkbhd eat in a day video
6986,69 nice
6987,nah
6988,the only thing i wan na know is can u change the watch face like the normal apple watch so i can add my photo face and hav it be a bunch of photo
6989,so this is just a flex watch basically
6990,nice lego
6991,compare a casio watch with a apple watch is strange and not logical
6992,apple watch 8 minion edition
6993,no watch is worth dollar800 dollar
6994,wait until he test the garmin fenix 7 the battery life will blow his mind
6995,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
6996,that wa my exact thought lol i currently use a fenix 6x but if it get to the point one of these can last through an entire backpacking trip i could absolutely see switching there is some interesting battery tech coming down the line so maybe soon
6997,brandon sup mkbhd chilling
6998,i like that shirt i want one where did you get it
6999,ohhh man it look huge even on mk i think it will be like a tablet on my wrist

7001,that off white style keyboard in the background tho
7002,the apple watch ultra had the best ad among the bunch watched it like 25 time
7003,i want to work for you
7004,i do see the ultra a the longest battery life apple watch
7005,can it be used in salt water
7006,my casio cost dollar15 is very slim ha a great retro aethestic that i enjoy and a 10 year battery life date alarm stopwatch timer that is all i need
7007,when apple come out with it in black and even a little more battery life i will consider it
7008,i will buy an apple watch when it can measure blood pressure
7009,dope
7010,ultra is the next step in product iphone 15 ultra is next
7011,dude i wear casios
7012,5 23 exactly
7013,this is the only apple watch i would consider buying i would immediately put it on a nato strap though
7014,what abt the evil looking red screen to prevent eye strain at night
7015,talk about garmins and suuntos and proceeds to show a g shock it is not even the same thing
7016,add solar
7017,i am more amazed at the amount of calorie than the actual apple watch absolutely insane
7018,hey marque what is up with your right wrist
7019,am i the only one who heard the goddamn meme
7020,love how samsung add the word pro to it watch while apple add the word ultra to it watch
7021,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7022,and nobody seems to care when samsung say pro but there an outcry when apple doe
7023,lmao so true did not catch that
7024,while comparing apple watch ultra with g shock and all watch 5pro would have been
7025,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7026,man that watch is ugly to the max it look like you have a plate attached to your wrist
7027,what if the hike is for 7 day it should have solar powered bat
7028,wr100m is minimum to swim nowhere nears dive standard
7029,when is the air pod pro 2 review dropping
7030,eventually these watch will last a full week on one charge apple and others will hopefully soon use flexible lithium ion solid state battery in the form of a battery wristband
7031,how wa it it sleep with though like wa it uncomfortable compared to the normal series 7 also can see you used older watch band on it but do all 44mm 45mm band fit look okay
7032,what impressed me is that the ultra is only le than 100 buck more than the stainless steel 45mm cellular series 8 with a regular band which make the ultra in my eye a pretty decent deal
7033,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7034,ob why are you investing in a 800 dollar watch when you can upgrade to the iphone 14 with that money
7035,for double the battery life too and it not like stainless steel is a expensive metal i think titanium cost more than s
7036,keep drinking that apple kool aid
7037,yeah it is le than what i have payed for my titanium s6
7038,great video and thanks for the insight additionally i love how you continue to inject your met gala presence haha flexing
7039,when to sleep with 69percent nice
7040,i like it i do not need it at all i am not even active at all v though some day i want to change that but i like it
7041,goosebump with the intro awesome man keep it up
7042,69percent
7043,great video love that an apple watch finally last more than a day a a triathlete who doe 1 2 and full ironman race i can finally stick with the apple ecosystem question how long doe it take to charge be great if it only take 30 40min so people can wake up put it on the charger do their morning routine and then put a fully charged watch back on their wrist cheer
7044,i would assume it is got the same fast charge capability a the previous series watch meaning you can get quite a charge in 30 minute maybe not completely full but if you throw it on at say 20 25 percent come back in 30 minute and you will have a good 80 or so
7045,of course apple watch battery is trash
7046,middle of nowhere
7047,it is just an suv of watch hardly anyone us an suv offroad they just want an suv
7048,are you wearing two watch
7049,i thinked also apple come with apple watch pro but they are come with apple watch ultra
7050,even in the smartwatch world 2 day battery is not impressive
7051,i can not imagine taking 2 day battery watch to the mountain trip sorry it suck
7052,this is more of a body computer than a watch i think
7053,800dollar
7054,how are you not screaming at me and yet you have my attention all the way through
7055,stop promoting planned obsolescence
7056,all fun and game till you scuba dive for more than 3 day
7057,why do people track everything nowadays it quite unnecessary

7069,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7070,mkbhd intro masterclass is the masterclass everyone want now kudos to the team
7071,loved this video
7072,i am one of those extreme user i have gone so long with my series 2 it is showing it is age and wear
7073,they should have at least called it max instead of ultra they never call anything ultra
7074,i did not even realize the price until i saw your thumbnail man that is a lot
7075,he missed out the group that can not afford an apple watch but still watch the video till the end
7076,disappointing battery life
7077,none of the apple product are worth their price
7078,why are you wearing it on right hand though
7079,i can buy 3 bicycle for the price of one apple watch ultra
7080,look gimmicky with how thick and tall it is
7081,dude that intro be like designed and made by apple
7082,or are we just going to ignore that perfectly vertical scar on his hand there
7083,my god these intro are just so satisfying ultra
7084,garmin give 7 day
7085,i would rather buy a good branded standard watch with that price
7086,doe it come in black batman doing small increment in his tech so doe you in your editing mkbhd like please

7093,galaxy watch5pro review
7094,stop looking down look up
7095,it look like a kid toy watch imo
7096,sick intro your better than any other youtuber he the big man
7097,great video
7098,thanks for your thought i wa not able to find anything on your thought and the oura ring just curious
7099,ya you said right that apple watch ultra only belong to the hardcore exerciser or any person who love to be an part of ultra family other people would be satisfied with the lower version of apple watch
7100,always looking forward for the amazing intro
7101,nice review it not fair to compare it to the similarly priced high end garmin watch maybe the dollar300 dollar400 one and then it twice the price of them garmin fenix 6x 7x we are talking 1 3 week of battery life with more gps and heart rate tracking so it still a fashion lifesytle watch and not going to be sufficient for ironman ultra endurance atheletes also i am waiting to see the tear down on how good the apple sapphire glass is i have heard rumor it significan notly softer than the garmin sapphire glass which is a game changer for a rugged watch i would love to see you do a comparision between this and a garmin fenix 7x sapphire your thought and opinion would be great to hear
7102,there is more to a smartwatch than battery life some people like me use their smartwatch a a phone replacement and can not do that with a garmin watch
7103,hell nah
7104,the editing just get better each time
7105,depends if apple paid you extra for watch renew or not
7106,this watch doe not compete with garmin watch of the world rather apple is trying to start a new category of smart watch luxury smart watch no precious metal or stone like people today appriciate luxury stainles steel mechanical watch apple belief people will appriciate luxury smart watch
7107,go bro
7108,loved that you mentioned middle of nowhere
7109,they will come out with a black case for the ultra watch
7110,he really ha to change his wearing hand too much that the tan look so pop
7111,yo who tf run 100 mile
7112,it is so big
7113,i got the series 8 45mm i will be sticking with that one
7114,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7115,thanks for the review i really enjoy your content super stoked for mine i surf and bodyboard but do not do the other ultra thing i just think it look sick
7116,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7117,where do you get all those dope intro track
7118,is not it 100 ft this is what apple showed
7119,1 10 look like something from a movie wow
7120,if you get colorware to pain the apple watch ultra please do a video on it
7121,i am not convinced that wa the middle of nowhere
7122,i understand mkbs point here but feel like he is dramatically underestimating the ability of an average user to want the best tech 90percent of the people who buy an ultra will not ever need it and that is ok too
7123,i hope this doe not cap the bigger regular series apple watch at 45 mm i wa hoping it increase to 47 mm in the future when i upgrade from my 44 mm series 6
7124,brotha marque your content is fire
7125,hey marque wa cellular active during your time using the apple watch the battery life is impressive a is even just for activity tracking but that would be even more insane if cellular wa active a well i am often away from my phone while doing activity so that is the most important thing for me
7126,it wa active but i am also mostly near my phone so i did not need it much
7127,thanks how heavy is the watch
7128,that is intro hit hyped from the beginning
7129,the pro thing is only because samsung registered watch pro so apple is not able to use it there is nothing else behind it
7130,so u interact with the crown with your left hand on right wrist
7131,if your wrist is bigger enough
7132,do not know why people doe not like big thick watch i live in switzerland the watch maker country and we love big watch that stand out also being only 50 more expensive than a steel series 8 with milanese loop it wa a no brainer for me
7133,twist pro doe not indicate the type of user pro dictate what the pro product can do or is pro at
7134,for me it is a must have purely for it size huge hand
7135,is that ultimate frisbee
7136,69percent battery life nice
7137,why did i try to double tap this vid lol great video man love your work
7138,should have rather been worth it nah
7139,this is actually great comparing to other brand like garmin
7140,wait i already have the battery saver on my series 7 but the ultra doe not have it yet
7141,smartwatches are never worth it they are not even watch they are e waste
7142,is not it funny how samsung is flagship phone use ultra and apple is iphones use pro but it is completely flipped for watch
7143,hat off to mkbhd and his team
7144,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7145,the one part you missed on is the people who would never buy an apple watch before regardless of the activity function simply because of look and now want one because it actually look good
7146,nah for that pricetag it better to buy a traditional watch like seiko tissot and hamilton
7147,who else noticed that scar on his hand
7148,seeing him weirdly grip that tesla wheel
7149,i love that you are very positive and talking only like thath on 1video even though you speak positive and love watching your channel and arun s mrwhosetheboss channel
7150,dollar90 huawei watch fit can do better job than apple
7151,1 10 bro the way you got the light on your arm and the watch is sooo legit
7152,seems apple is willing to cater to everyone including the 1000 scuba diver in the world over gamers lol
7153,still no camera
7154,49mm watch geez let just wear an ipad on the wrist
7155,it is been so long since we have heard this song
7156,in a nutshell not worthy
7157,yoo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7158,review moto edge 30 ultra
7159,introducing the new apple pro pro all the pro with the pro being a pro
7160,that watch doe not look nearly a big a i thought it would be
7161,even though this wa meant for adventure people will buy to show off
7162,i wish they could stick 2000 nit bright display and better battery into the usual form factor of apple watch 8 not a fan of the thick titanium frame around
7163,matte black with a red anodized button would be sweet
7164,i still prefer my garmin
7165,intro
7166,battery noice
7167,fitbit user be like how is 2 5 day an achievement
7168,good video but when you started talking about the rog phone it made me remember to get ready for school because my teacher have a rog phone
7169,while it cool i will probably never wear a smart watch shit get annoying to charge every day
7170,the intro were the best it is like an apple advertisement
7171,there is something all reviewer seem to forget when comparing the watch ultra feature with people is need expensive watch are always packed with feature no one will ever use and people just want to brag about and apple know it
7172,i have the same problem a you do marque i too have small wrist so that watch look over sized
7173,not able to download this video without premium
7174,black would of made me consider this replacing my garmin much more haha
7175,nice intro mate
7176,apple is really smart they are only saying that they are targeting these pro endurance adventurer but really they are targeting the larger audience people who like to look pro similar to why nike sell the image of being pro to an ordinary person
7177,in theatre mode
7178,doe that casio have always on gps apple to orange
7179,i need to go try one on if i think i can play golf with it i think i will get one
7180,just let that sink in this watch ha more computer power than all of nasa back in 1969 when it sent two astronaut to the moon
7181,the ruggedness might be my favourite part
7182,day since the last met gala flex 0
7183,and here i am with my gear s 3 frontier from 2018 with 3 4days avg battery aside the feature set it offer do seem quite nice and useful
7184,i once bought a smartwatch from china that wa this size back in 2017 that ran android 5 1 i got mocked so much for how huge it wa now this exists
7185,g shock ha always been big and invicta
7186,simon im aware i am mostly referring to the sheeple fan base that all of a sudden will think watch this size are okay when back then they mocked the size
7187,watch bigger than this have existed for decade
7188,wow the editing is god tier on this video
7189,marque sleep with a watch
7190,a a triathlete i am curious if it is compatible with power meter ant protocol
7191,great question the conectivity of the high end garmins is just crazy so many option for the sensor you can connect to
7192,how can anyone sleep with watch on
7193,not this dude cry about using the word pro again
7194,i would pick up the next version with customizable color at purchase
7195,i think you underestimate the appeal of a big watch even to non adventurer just look at all the average runner who have to wear a 1980 looking garmin block with font that echo old casio quartz it will be the same many just will want to have the biggest coolest even if they sit in front of a computer all day
7196,the name watch pro is already patented thats why they had to come up with the name ultra
7197,prrooo human
7198,a an ultra distance cyclist the regular apple watch really didn t do it but now the watch ultra is more expensive than my bike and therefore doesn t do it either
7199,pedro prego that is indeed correct
7200,halfdome05 stevens no longer claim to have a sub 1000euros bike they used to not anymore i guess inflation reach everyone both apple and stevens tabor
7201,pedro prego i ride a stevens tabor with tiagra shimano component also i am in europe therefore the price calculation are a bit difficult an apple watch ultra here is 999euros and my bike wa just below that perhaps not quite the same a in the u but you get the idea
7202,halfdome05 if i go on wallmart there are indeed sub 1000dollar bike there i would not go very far away from home on them but if work for you nice i have never seen anyone riding one 100 mile trip not to mention reall ultra endurance stuff but maybe you are the 1 in a planet which make you really not comparable to anyone else
7203,pedro prego next mean without sale tax since the 800 dollar for the apple watch are also without sale tax just the bike mean without any upgrade like bike computer etc
7204,even someone who prefers round watch i like the design of this one and it ha a bunch of great feature but my similar sized garmin watch ha up to 50 day and still over a month with regular use battery life i understand that this ha way more stuff that drain the battery but a week is a must in my opinion plus i am not sure how well it would work with android but that is not the point here one thing i am hoping this watch start is the bigger casing variant most watch stop at 46mm proper sport watch can go up to 51mm i could see a new ultra line from everyone with that size
7205,and it ha a notch on the side
7206,those intro are getting better and better
7207,truly ultra
7208,this look like it got a biggest ram too
7209,it 1400 usd in sweden i think nah not ever
7210,a a person that work in construction and also wear an apple watch every day while working i decided to upgrade from my series 5 to this will i ever use the marathon the hiking or the diving feature probably not but the ruggedness the battery life the bright screen and how big it is all speak to my need keep up the good review mkbhd
7211,cristian baluta there are construction worker in australia that are in the top 5percent of earner
7212,this is the first time i heard a construction worker with an apple watch
7213,tako flame because gshock is shockingly ugly that it is embarassing
7214,screwt4pe garmin is so ugly esp the ui that i would be embarass to use it iphone on ky wrist is so much useful i wont be awake for awake anyway
7215,godd did not ask tho
7216,love the honesty some people just gon na buy it cause it is the most expensive one though
7217,or because they like the look of it but do not need the feature is there anything wrong with that though if we were purely utilitarian we would not have most of the furniture and affordances we currently all have in our home
7218,if you spend more than 5 sec fiddling with your watch you are better off just grabbing your phone and getting a superior experience
7219,the shot switching between the watch on your left wrist and right wrist are driving me crazy lol
7220,i prefer 100dollar casio granted it not a smartwatch but personally i do not need any smart feature
7221,animation keep getting better
7222,this is what we have been waiting for
7223,hi what size strap is that medium how tall are u
7224,i did not charge my smart watch for 16 day and it still had 40percent battery when i decided to charge it it only took like 10 min to charge fully a well with a 12 watt charging brick only downside is that it doe not have touch screen super pleased though with the garmin smart watch
7225,smart watch lol
7226,you had u in 1st half
7227,it is getting better ev every year not what would be next flexi watch
7228,it is not worth it
7229,how many time doe he have to say in a nice way that many people would look like dork wearing
7230,i will stick with my garmin fenix 7x solar sapphire and 16 day with running and gym
7231,look ugly
7232,pro airpods user is just a professional who work from a coffee shop or open plan office xd
7233,cool quality
7234,you do not need to use theatre mode to make the display not responsive when using workout all you need to use is water lock swipe left when starting a workout and it will lock the screen from touch input
7235,the nice after each 69 number sighting is a sign of a man of culture
7236,i wonder if garmin had a good cheaper alternative with longer battery life i just need something to track work out or something
7237,2000 cal sound like a lot if just normal day would be that so eating 4000cal sound insane i have really hard time believing these number
7238,wow
7239,why you driving tesla i thought you liked the gm and ford ev
7240,so how doe it compare to the galaxy watch 5 pro what about the normal apple watch the closest comparison to this device are different smartwatches not the dedicated tracker what can it actually do above the galaxy or normal apple watch
7241,try the galaxy watch 5 pro
7242,i want a rugged iphone name it extreme
7243,they should have a titanium iphone 14 max pro to match color with the ultra
7244,marquee you were supposed to convince me i needed this and that it wa not overkill so i could justify the cost
7245,the aesthetic to me personally doe not too appealing in normal everyday situation like at an office job grocery shopping or going to school
7246,3 12 and price
7247,look up perpetual calendar automatic watch and be blown away of the battery life
7248,getting back into scuba diving and i picked it up so that i would not have to buy another dive computer you should always have a backup and using this is a my primary dive computer and my original computer a my backup will be a great upgrade for my dive setup and my apple watch yeah it is expensive but only barely a stainless apple watch with a leather band go for dollar750 and with a metal band it will be more expensive than the ultra will i be using the ultra functionality of it every weekend probably not diving can be expensive but it will go wherever i go and can improve the experience of the activity it will last longer be more durable and have a much nicer screen that is more than enough to justify the price in my opinion the real question is when are we getting a black model
7249,for me i am in the ocean a lot swimming and surfing so something more sturdy and water resistant is a necessity which is why the ultra is a no brainer compared to the aw8
7250,13 06 it is just regular for him coming from an ex ulti player this is extremely difficult crazy
7251,real life pip boy
7252,i want an apple watch so bad
7253,damn i got ta get into ultimate i could use an extra 2000 cal in a day
7254,it is crap huawei watch battery go on for 7 day
7255,these intro are absolutely amazing and it is even cooler now that i know how much effort is put into these from watching your studio channel
7256,the animation around the watch for the intro and even the workout countdown looping around the wrist chef is kiss
7257,look amazing will the sensor take heart rate health reading over tattooed sleeve skin though i will stick with the garmin fenix if not
7258,that ha to be one of the best intro from any competing tech youtuber that i have seen so far incredible work from the mkbhd team
7259,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7260,john dawson you seem like a bot with that thoughtless comment dogwater touch grass virgo
7261,sarthak modh he is not a bot and the intro wa really pleasant to watch if you do not appreciate it move along
7262,sarthak modh did not ask
7263,enric beitler technically yes but the way you have phrased the compliment make it seem that there is one of the amazingly good b roll the team make which in this video doe not exist i understand you are not a bot but just saying the commentor doe have a point
7264,wow awesome
7265,did anybody else see the samsung smartwatch
7266,in my opinion this watch is greatly well made but no matter how complicated technology ha been put into that thing making it that expensive the most important thing of it is to keep track of time
7267,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7268,and it doe keep track of time
7269,they removed the clock on this one
7270,i wonder how many of these i will see at school haha
7271,at least it is ultra ugly
7272,crazy world we live in when cell phone and smart watch cost just a much a budget laptop
7273,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7274,h tsun i agree classic case of convenience over necessity
7275,how did it get here
7276,not that crazy for smartphones majority of ordinary people nowadays probably have more use for a smartphone than a laptop fulfills e mail social browsing camera nav nearly all need for average person laptop are joining desktop in becoming more of a professional prosumer creatives student tool mainly i reckon
7277,finally the video i have been waiting for
7278,after switching to garmin i do not think i will ever switch back to apple watch 30 day of battery life solar charging extremely durable multi satellite gps ton of different workout i highly recommend the garmin fenix 7
7279,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7280,thanks for these comment guy you just gave me an idea for my next video
7281,aris routis it is phenomenal for an apple watch sure garmin is slaughtering apple in the battery life department but they are different kind of smartwatches with different usecases i like to use my apple watch a a replacement for my phone and can not do that with a garmin
7282,apple try to play with the big boy at fitness ie garmin with this comparison is something that ha to happen and seriously now garmin is slaughtering apple battery life when my garmin fenix 6 is at one full week with most setting on and if we go to model with solar panel it is not even a fair comparison trying to say that 3 day of battery life is phenomenal just make me laugh
7283,also the feature that garmin lack are made up by the smartphone you likely already have best of both world
7284,where are galaxy watch
7285,ga dam
7286,good review i turned off the always on display on my series 7 and it usually get 48 hour of life if they made a smaller version of the ultra i would probably get it for now it is too big
7287,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7288,wish they made something with a bigger diagonal but thinner
7289,tha bigger size is what i like haha to each their own
7290,same here
7291,only a minute in but your battery life surely wa extended by your use of theater mode and funny enough i am sure how many notification your watch buzz for drastically change battery life no friend great battery lol
7292,iphone ultra loading
7293,these intro keep getting better and better damn
7294,the editor snapped on this
7295,i have a pretty chronic case of range anxiety bigger battery always better i do not dive not really climbing everest today imagine that activity reminder you still have an hour to close your everest ring i am sold on battery alone
7296,marque you are the best
7297,can not wait for mine to come friday
7298,an ultra watch need to have atleast 2 week of battery it also need to support cycling sensor metric apart from swimming and running so this is not an ultra watch at all
7299,samsung named the newest galaxy watch a pro so apple took the ultra name
7300,link to podcast
7301,my series 4 is still kicking i think i will wait until apple update the ultra with a black color way and then consider upgrading
7302,100m of water resistance doe not mean it can get anywhere near those depth it is just a measurement of pressure which is equivalent to 10atm which is about half of the minimum spec for a watch to be considered dive capable you do not want to take a 100m wr watch diving
7303,dynamic pressure are almost zero when swimming or diving if the watch can take static pressure of 100m then it is fine for 40m which is what the apple advert show
7304,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7305,espressomatic 100m of water resistance get you down to the bottom of a swimming pool if you are careful the 100m ha nothing to do with the actual depth that the watch is capable of achieving i would be surprised if that thing with all the moving part and ceramic glass case back could get anywhere near the depth they advertise but no no serious diver will spend dollar800 on a gimmick
7306,you can not even jump into a pool with a 100m watch because the pressure of impact with the surface is way higher
7307,rec diving is down to 130 foot 39 6m or otherwise le than half of 100m apple is advertisement and software feature are for dive down to 40m is still deeper than 90percent of diver are ever going to go this thing is going to be huge in the diving world
7308,lol an ultra watch next will be ultra sock and uw
7309,i wonder if debrand will offer skin for the watch to make it black camouflaged etc
7310,excellent a always
7311,nothing like my 40mm series 6 this is just too big i am good thanks
7312,69percent nice
7313,i havent tried disc sport but 192 bpm in disk sport
7314,quality content
7315,dw ultra max soon come
7316,you have missed out people who work in construction like me a more rugged apple watch with a bigger battery is hugely useful to me which is why i ordered one
7317,z j should live in the uk
7318,robsa walker i agree tradesman make serious money this day and age especially skilled tradesman
7319,there are a lot of comment on here from people who seem to not understand that there are lot of people who are on site who work trade and make good money do you need an aw no do you need a rolex no do you need a bmw instead of a dacia no but weirdly some people own all these thing so weird i wonder why
7320,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7321,his noodly appendage when up a 20 foot ladder being able to take a call make a call or take a text or send a text hand free is priceless a casio only tell the time the aluminum case get wasted by sweat sand grit off grinding disc etc the titanium is much more rugged and the rounded bezel of the regular watch is a liability when in construction
7322,i have been waiting for a watch that can last a weekend away on the lake
7323,a big nah
7324,that beat fuckin knock
7325,i would rather spend a little more and get a good mechanical watch instead
7326,diver wont like this xd up to 100 meter most diver wont even use a seiko dive watch that go up to 200
7327,nah
7328,garmin gt everything else
7329,now mkbhd ha given some point for apple to take note make it like a casio watch infinite battery and tapered edge anyway this watch is too much for me
7330,holy shit the intro is do not stop getting better mad prop to the studio
7331,doe not feel like there is any new sound alert notification noise with the ultra surely it is time for some sound update right
7332,omg i love this video
7333,what i really like is that i am an european that said i am very happy to pay 1000euros on a stupid watch that is not that different from a normal apple watch thanks eu and apple
7334,i had to rewatch the intro so bloody siccck
7335,0 17 you are welcome
7336,0 10 my reaction exactly it look so good
7337,i wa hoping someone else heard that lmao
7338,can i just say the box on the video background idea with the box to fit with the rugged look of the watch is smart just that tiny detail make sense
7339,in my opinion it just plain ugly if they made the ultra a attractive a the series 8 keeping with the same titanium build i would buy it that orange action button and crown that only come in that color will be a big turn off for a lot of people apple is famous for this though they give u what we ask for with a catch and it annoyed me since the original iphone not to mention the band are ugly too we also are not given a lot of option no hermes or metal band it is just not for me i will wait to see what they do with it next year
7340,that is ultra expensive
7341,yoo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7342,goofy ahh joke
7343,where is the link
7344,i do not know anything about smart watch and their usual battery life but what you said in the intro about this one is battery life sounded pretty damn impressive
7345,doe dirt get into the crevice where the crown is how easy is it to clean
7346,i can literally pause the video and say no it is not worth the price doe not matter what kind of review you give it that watch is not worth the price
7347,still waiting for airpods pro review
7348,my fossil smartwatch last roughly 4 hour unless i turn off everything useful then it will make it 8 hour it stay in my watch box now
7349,i wa gon na watch the podcast but it wa not in fact below the like button
7350,he will nah man
7351,dollar800 for watch and you are asking if it is worth it
7352,dang
7353,course it not worth 800
7354,i have the series 5 and have no issue with it except for battery life despite the price i will be getting the ultra exclusively for the battery the waypoint feature will be fun for geocaching but realistically i do that twice a year maybe battery life is critical for me though
7355,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7356,bruh the watch is 800 dollar you can legit get the iphone 14 with dat money
7357,brainwashed
7358,i have the series 5 and got it when it came out and the battery doe not last a long i am glad i pay the dollar 4 00 a month for applecare plus so when i have time i will take it to the apple store due to battery but still a good watch
7359,same battery life wa a huge yes for me
7360,that glance and catch wa sick wtf
7361,the apple watch series 7 came in black titanium and did not scratch so it could have totally been done weird choice by apple not to introduce a black titanium variant
7362,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7363,and cost 99 99 more for the privilege
7364,it is gon na be black next year dollar bet
7365,i feel like marque channel would be one that is in a great position to create multilingual content like mr beast i do not speak spanish but i am sure there are million of spanish speaker who would love to hear what he ha to say
7366,can not wait for the pro max ultra plus
7367,best intro by far
7368,great video i have to say i really like the naming for this a the usual pro name doe not really mean anything at this point apart from having the top feature you are not actually a pro user during this video you said extreme many time which i think can be easily replaced with the word ultra it ha a set of feature for those who will actually take it to it limit
7369,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7370,waste of money
7371,waste of money
7372,do you always wear your watch on the right wrist
7373,i got the apple watch series 4 and i am unhappy with the battery life on it but other than that it doe a an apple watch should it is not the best one in the lot but i am not interested in paying more then 100 dollar for a watch that is just me
7374,this is no where near worth 800 dollar
7375,those intro never feel bored hat off to the mkbhd editor
7376,hashtag aroma what did u meant by boring
7377,boring
7378,squirky he doe
7379,hamad he made boring video very attractive
7380,marque you are awesome thanks for your analysis
7381,honestly i am just gon na stick with my garmin
7382,i am thinking of buying it but my condition is like i do work under hard marine environment so the roughness of it is what matter the most for it gon na look for more destructives test to decide if it worth getting or not
7383,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7384,scratch at mo scale 6 so that is sediment sand anodised metal etc
7385,why do i feel like even dollar1b for this would be a great value it just too good
7386,ultra watch upgrade do not target professional activity if you call it pro it may create the wrong impression about it purpose
7387,apple watch ultra pro max will cover your entire hand
7388,i have got a dive computer rrp gbp700 it is a huge display but i only use it when i am diving this watch might be interesting to use for recreational diving i am not switching a my computer is synced with my air integrated system and i got my computer for half that price
7389,l szl fekete would be cool to try but a someone mentioned do not know much about longevity of the watch my computer is very reliable thou it is the suunto eon steel but got it second hand for gbp300
7390,mel gross i have not yet gone past 100ft but i want to get more confident before i explore deeper depth
7391,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7392,i just wonder if the ultra will be good for diving in 5 10 year still id hate to use it when it get old and it break under the pressure and i can not see my depth and time
7393,it will be interesting if oceanic is really worth the 80dollar yr subscription for scuba diving there is a reason why garmin made the dive mode separate to other activity on the descent series rather than just another app
7394,this watch thickkkkk bruhh
7395,top
7396,i love the design and how big it is yet still light weight
7397,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7398,8 57 the only audio editing mistake weird cut i have ever seen on the channel great video otherwise
7399,dbrand need some skin for it
7400,wonder what sort of watch other company will make to compete with this
7401,there is one pro market that garmin is dominating and i do not see the apple watch ultra taking over military the ruggedness concern is more the need for at least 1 week is there the need for it to run completely independently or anonymously aka kill all wireless sensor also in some scenario we just are not to have any smart watch even garmin but i will admit i am really tempted and want to see if there any review that cover this usage
7402,just like 10k desktop not for me or 90percent of people in this comment section
7403,gaaadaamn
7404,what if apple is planing to launch apple watch pro next year at 599 right between series 9 at 399 and ultra at 799
7405,the intro is fire
7406,i am sure this ha been asked countless of time but what happened with the scar on his right hand
7407,why are you comparing battery life from a black and white casio watch to basically an iphone on your wrist
7408,a a guy with tiny wrist i really wish they made a smaller version of this thing
7409,nice
7410,hey can u put the band of the ultra on the normal apple watch 8
7411,always remember it is pool proof not salt proof aka salt water
7412,the action button is definitely what action man had on his watch i can definitely see where apple got their inspiration
7413,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7414,2 day battery on a watch and it get a pretty good from mkbhd damn what will my smart watch with 50 day batter backup get only if it had a apple logo somewhere on it p a watch with le than 10 day battery backup is useless for me any trip or outside activity i plan i have to consider charging a silly watch that is too much pain in the a for me
7415,make apple watch series from starting
7416,1059euros in europe not worth it
7417,apple watch ultra 2 incoming
7418,lmao he said 69 which refrences to the sex position xd
7419,marque i am sure if you contacted dbrand they would make a black skin for the watch i am not sure how durable it would be but i am sure they would do it also i love the look of this apple watch i am an android guy and currently have a samsung watch 4 classic when i saw this ultra model i really wanted it until i found out apple watch are not compatible with android phone
7420,what an intro omg
7421,best watch out today android user can only dream of something like this
7422,damn no wonder he is so fit also i only go to my kitchen and eat food so i do not think i need this
7423,little stick people for reference nice
7424,great vid they are getting into the garmin space woulda been great to see more comparison
7425,exactly you are getting all the feature with more than double the battery life a well a some of the smart watch feature
7426,would be sick to see him do a comparison between this and the fenix 7x he will then see what good battery life is
7427,pretty soon wealthy people will be buying an apple watch instead of a rolex to show off their wealth
7428,it is not rated for 100m depth but rather for 40m the 100m is for static pressure air integration is the same thing a tank pressure monitoring i believe apple watch ultra doe not have this
7429,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7430,i can guarantee you that if you place the apple watch in a tank 99 meter deep you can take it out an hour later and the watch will be fine 40m is the dive rating for all the dive feature and the dive software at 131 foot it is also at the recreational diving limit
7431,it is still mind blowing to think that apple would actually make a watch that is without a doubt an overkill and is way above the competition with consideration from athlete diver explorer etc but yet make their pro phone still have a lightning port
7432,i do not think serious diver will use this since it doe not have the tech to monitor oxygen level in your tank
7433,actually i will never buy a apple watch i like my tech to be longlasting and aesthetically pleasing i would rather spend it on a dumb watch looking just fine since my main use case is showing the time and being an aesthetical accessory there are really nice looking watch out of the town glashuette which are mostly not that big chungus style watch i do have to say i like feature like general heartbeat tracking sleep tracking and step but more like from a long term perspective did i sleep much le the last 3 month like in summer i can observe that my sleep is quite shorter then in winter a well i do not want to charge the watch daily i like to just wear it and forget about it which is why i turned the notification off still the best smart watch is for me the withings i just have the steel hr maybe would upgrade to an scanwatch but pretty surely will get a really nice looking mechanical watch before
7434,no live size comparison at all
7435,what happened to the camera quality
7436,this is not a regular review it is a ultra review
7437,mkbhd ultra
7438,mkbhd eagerly waiting for your moto edge 30 ultra review hope you will cover it
7439,how is the orange band
7440,despite apple is effort to market this to the niche user it will still be used by people trying to flex everywhere just like the air pod max
7441,keep up the great review yours are excellent
7442,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7443,by turning of the most notification i get almost the same batterylife with my old watch 6 sad about this one only produced in silver
7444,for the price it is still missing solar charging if they are trying to target the outdoor adventurer it need solar charging like the garmin watch and other competitor in the market
7445,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7446,ultra look cool but autonomy is extra low in compare to real sport watch like garmins
7447,or you can get an omega watch that will last you a lifetime really great opening btw
7448,they need a big face watch
7449,00 00 watch on right hand 00 05 watch on left hand 00 13 watch on right hand 00 17 watch on left hand 00 23 watch on right hand
7450,ok that low battery sound at 1 11 really got me i wa like damn did not i just charge my earphone last night

7457,it is actually cheaper than the stainless steel cellular apple watch series 8 and all ultra model come with cellular built in for no extra charge

7461,that unboxing experience though
7462,cough cough wait hold my garmin i mean my beer
7463,this ultra rugged ultra outdoor capable dollar800 watch will be bought by men in their 20 40 who drive to their office cubicle and do not do any physical activity at all
7464,i am sorry but the watch ultra is obnoxiously big even next to marque giant hand it look too big
7465,remember the day when we could get a maxed out iphone at dollar800
7466,inflation
7467,i bought a series 7 new for dollar329 a few week ago and i love it no regret but the ultra look amazing i have no purpose for one though

7469,i bought a cellour series 7 45mm for gbp460 when i saw the series 8 i wa like what is the point paying 400gbp more on that

7471,toobalicious u can brag to ur friend that u have the apple watch ultra
7472,me too costco deal i thought about my use case and can not justify going ultra
7473,i want to like it and it work for most people but it is not the watch for people who do endurance sport that last 24 hour or do not want to have to charge their watch every couple day my coros vertix 2 watch ha not been charged since september 2 i have logged 27 hour of gps running during that time and it still ha 54percent battery life left the coros is also about dollar100 cheaper
7474,apple need to design a wireless battery adapter that connects to the watch while on your wrist during sleep to charge it then in the morning you dock the battery pack and let it charge back to full and then go about your day
7475,totaly biting off samsung ultra why not pro max lol
7476,got ta appreciate the lego bonsai tree in the background
7477,yoo marque u a lefty bro hahah
7478,i like this despite the fact it is pretty useless to a lazy boy like myself battery life still suck compared to say the entire amazfit series that go past 2 or more week on a charge while still being very useful to the vast majority of folk i hope apple get that in future version great review marque

7492,i can not even afford a macbook for school i would not want something like this
7493,smart rolex innit
7494,but why even bother get a garmin fenix last like 7 day with activity on give you all the same functionality and it meant to be for outdoor activies
7495,pretty pointless imo
7496,you should have really compared it to a garmin epix still doe not do enough but a good step forward for apple

7534,samsung and apple traded pro and ultra with each other this year iykyk
7535,you are still the best youtuber on the planet keep it up bruh
7536,yeah a 3 hour workout ai not gon na burn 2000 calorie that is like 80percent of a marathon buy garmin with a battery that can last over a month
7537,andr castro a 3 hour run can burn 2000 kcal yeah if you are way above average and can keep a relatively high running pace for 3 hour which very few can and do you think he is gon na do a 3 hour workout burning 2000 kcal midday being able to work afterwards and repeat the day after i am just saying that the watch appears to be highly inaccurate
7538,a 3hrs run can burn 2 000kcals easily if the person is a pro and run non stop i often run for 2hrs and my watch say i burn 1 300kcals on that
7539,metacarpal fracture
7540,1 11 i thought my airpods were dying lol
7541,the editing in this video is amazing
7542,perfect video while i am heading to the apple store
7543,been waiting for this
7544,apple please give u a pro model amp let u connect two iphones to one apple watch most professional i know have a business phone and personal this is the pro model right
7545,it is cool but too expensive
7546,i have a lot of 20syl and alltta music in my playlist and i always get excited when i hear one of their track in these video
7547,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7548,too bad i have stopped doing triathlons and recently got the series 8 and i got my garmin 945 with awesome battery life this is massive watch for my small wrist actually the normal series 8 is more wearable too
7549,i feel there is a limit to how smart a watch need to be i used to have an android based smart watch and the battery life wa poor now i have a garmin venu sq it doe all the fitness health tracking i need ha phone notification and medium control yet the battery last all week it is just the right amount of smart
7550,just a question are you also carrying your phone on you when you go out for a workout
7551,sick graphic and efx
7552,that intro wa
7553,nice surround sound in intro and amazing editing
7554,while i know i will never own this watch i will watch anything marque make always top tier content
7555,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7556,simp
7557,same
7558,can we stop calling this thing a watch it is not a watch one of the feature it ha is a watch it is a computer or whatever new word you want to make up
7559,me too
7560,love the way it look
7561,i am a watch guy for all the detail and feature yes but i would wait til the next gen
7562,u kidding right ya apart from bear grylls point of view straight away it not worth it for others period
7563,for 800dlls you can actually buy a really nice stainless steel watch that wont become ewaste in the next 4 year
7564,feel like the watch 5 pro is a better choice 90percent of the feature much better battery life and like half the price
7565,design look like from a caterpillar or some other construction company watch for hardcore worker
7566,i love the packaging
7567,the real question is can it beat the garmin fenix
7568,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7569,the apple watch doe not do recovery time via hrv which is disappointing so no it doe not beat the fenix fenix also doe solar charging and you get all the button with the ability to turn off the touchscreen in the 7 i would not call my fenix a true smart watch since the phone integration is not there but i would not call the apple watch a true adventure watch compared to my fenix 6 solar
7570,definitely not apple wa really trying their best to grab the attention of garmin user with this one and i think they juuuust missed the mark there is some feature that garmins have that an apple watch will not get probably for a while thing like ant and vo2 max but also garmin user want a sport watch first and a smartwatch second
7571,apple sapphire is not pure
7572,mel gross what are you talking about apple watch have shit ordinary glass just like this pseudo watch it never even stood next to real sapphire or titanium
7573,that thing ha all the apple watch upgrade i wanted it is just 200dollar too expensive
7574,it is the same price a always
7575,let is goo finally
7576,going full casey neistat on u with that visualization of apple watch user no fancy animation low on time or money
7577,marque steady making movie
7578,marque love from india
7579,not yet nvr the first iteration catch it next year nice looker though
7580,the bigger battery is nice but that thing look like too much of a chonker for my wrist
7581,yoo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7582,can we just get a regular one with better battery life
7583,i still do not get yet another device that ha to be charged every other day
7584,a watch that go to your phone that cost more than your phone
7585,bro why u hold the yoke like dat
7586,apple watch ultra fall in that small gray area that you keep mentioning something like gaming phone like 2 3 year ago or sony is latest alpha phone etc like for those with specific demand regarding a device
7587,maybe some day in the future or next year they will make a pro watch fro extra more money
7588,the apple watch ultra to be honest is an quite refined apple watch with it rectangular edge and that is why i adore the watch apart from the same previous design
7589,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7590,julian walnuss no the main reason people are liking the design is that people have different taste and there are ton of people who like a more rugged technical look better than a polished shiny look there are some people who will want it for the prestige of having the most expensive smartwatch from this brand but a lot of people just simply like how it look
7591,julian walnuss no you have missed it entirely that boxy look is precisely what some people are loving and it ha nothing to do with the branding apple is going to sell more ultra watch than other company will sell their entire product line
7592,julian walnuss this watch is not made for look tho
7593,to me it doe not look elegant anymore the silver housing look huge and boxy if this had been the first iteration of the apple watch everyone would have called it ugly the main reason people are liking the design is that it is now connected to the ultra branding and symbolizes high end tech and a high price
7594,this music give some nostalgia to f2 freestylers
7595,love from india
7596,that awkward hold on the tesla steering
7597,ruggedized elegance
7598,in india so costly
7599,hey marque
7600,never been so early on a mkbhd video always love your video this will probably be my first apple watch
7601,in germany this shit is 999euros
7602,20syl and mkbhd is always gon na be the best intro for sure
7603,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7604,thanks for the vid
7605,that scar on your hand look sick
7606,would have prefered the airpods pro 2 review emargo to lift instead but a mkbhd video about the watch is nice too let is hope for tomorrow for the airpods review
7607,the presentation of your video is impressive regular viewer from bangladesh
7608,buy me a macbook thanks
7609,i fall in between the apple watch and the apple watch ultra because of my rather heavy use and long workout it will be nice for an apple watch pro where it is in between both watch
7610,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7611,having worn sapphire crystal all my life the isapphire scratching at mohs scale 6 is a deal breaker for me i need a rugged watch for mountain biking like my fenix 6 i get two full week battery including weekend ride dual gps already and zero scratch on the screen after eighteen month
7612,gabriel freitas thank you
7613,karrdio that is great but it is meant to be much stronger than it is sapphire is an 8 on the mohs scale and should not be scratched by anything lower this new apple watch fails miserably at a 6
7614,with deeper groove at a level 7
7615,mohs
7616,i have the black stainless steel series 4 and there is not a single mark anywhere on it after four year my mom ha a regular aluminum series 5 and it is covered in surface wear micro scratch all over the screen i can not speak for how well it would hold up in heavy outdoors activity i am very much an inside person but for normal use the sapphire crystal is far more durable than the glass in the regular watch i have been looking at getting a new one maybe this year or next year but probably next year i still get two day out of my battery with my light use
7617,havent heard him use that intro song again in so long the song called voice by 20syl if u want to know
7618,nah

7653,apple watch toofan edition

7657,trump want to see biden in prison biden what make trump believe i would visit him in prison
7658,make a video on samsung watch 5 amp watch 5 pro
7659,man i hope the pixel watch come through i am tempted to switch to apple is walled garden
7660,considering comparable garmins are 2 3x the price absolutely build quality alone it is worth it
7661,petr peller you can get a fenix or an epix for under dollar1k they do way more for the active lifestyle since that is what they are specialized for either way most people considering these watch do not need either of them lol it is almost just a flex to look rich at this point very few people are so active that they would regularly use a bunch of the feature provided
7662,the epix 2 which is arguably the closest garmin competitor to the ultra and it is 999 exactly but that one also ha way more feature
7663,comparable garmin is descent mk2 which is about the same price
7664,since when do comparable garmins cost dollar2k
7665,uploaded 4 min ago and ha 18k view already woah
7666,hello
7667,bruh how are people already commenting on the quality of this video when it literally came out second ago

7673,how is the tesla yoke working out for you
7674,dayum
7675,a an android user the watch look really cool along with it feature the thing is dollar800 for a watch feel kinda overkill that is just my opinion on it
7676,yo fam i am a small content creator and i make a variety of entertaining reaction vlogs and a range of other content and i am still working on quality but i guarantee you will find something you will enjoy
7677,t rtle well seeing a you can get a garmin which is more accurate for half the price would suggest it is in fact overpricex
7678,dr gaz matic literally none of them are apple silicon mac make every pc look funny iphones pro are by far the best flagship phone airpods are the best anc headset maybe you could make argument about apple tv or some other niche shit that nobody try to compare to anything lol
7679,simon tf are you talking about who the hell love or hate a brand please do not project your insecurity on people apple product are overpriced no one debate that
7680,dr gaz matic a lot of apple product are but not all the m1 macbook air and m1 mac mini for instance are far from overpriced and actually pretty good deal you just lose credibility when you let your love hate for a brand blind your judgement
7681,nah it is ugly a fack and to pay an overprice for a watch that will only work for 3 4 year it is kinda dumb
7682,69percent battery nice
7683,you were saying the watch looked too big or would be for your wrist and stuff earlier but really i do not think it look out of place at all
7684,you are telling like what i wanted to tell everyone
7685,it is crazy how you went from an iphone camera to a red camera and i did not see a quaility difference
7686,watch look like it wa ripped off from an iron man suit
7687,oooh nah
7688,i guess you have an inevitable relationship with 69percent battery in your life
7689,0 09 am i hearing right is that a subtle got damn
7690,the apple watch ultra is dollar50 le than the stainless steel version 45 mm apple watch series 8 here where i live so yes it is actually such a good deal where the apple watch ultra is currently priced

7709,let is go
7710,2 minute ago gang
7711,been waiting for this video to drop
7712,it is definitely not worth it
7713,the apple watch ultra ha a very specific target audience it is great if you are a pro athlete but someone like me who would never need any of these feature still want it
7714,richard blahou ek a a hunter hiker i bought a garmin fenix 6 sapphire to replace my apple watch i got so tired of having to charge it my hunting buddy ha a garmin and i got jealous of his battery life and never needing to charge i can go 15 day without charging and that includes sleep monitoring my mind is blown
7715,that is how luxury product work they hint at a lifestyle you aspire to even if you will never have it
7716,this is not a watch for professional athlete this is more like for people who want a stronger watch for weekd hiking or for occasional shorter running and they like the apple watch i think it would be really good for diver but other sport im not sure cycling nope it is not possible to connect any plugins rear radar watt meter or display ultra runner trail runner how they say nope if someone is running longer than according to apple 17 hour he will be out of battery thru hiker i do not think so 300 500mah of battery you need every evening if you are out in mountain for 1 2 week you do not want to spare energy on watch or take second power bank just for watch i wished that aw ultra will be suitable for athlete and put a proper battery and connectivity in to it but no maybe 2 or 3 gen will be better make it 30 hour on battery with gps add connectivity and i will pay anything
7717,but if you have a tiny wrist like mkbhd nah
7718,try garmin you will be impressed specifically garmin enduro or garmin epix
7719,doe the absence of the pro model in the current apple watch lineup mean an upgraded regular non athletic focused apple watch named pro is coming
7720,the intro are literally looking like a proper apple ad at this point insane
7721,that is really good battery life damn

7790,been waiting for this review i just wish that battery life wa a little longer do not get me wrong 2 day is a good amount but i just want 5 7 day battery life p awesome content a always though and i will defiantly be looking to buy at some point soon
7791,keaton anderson there are mechanical watch that run for year on end there are also sport watch with display that run for month and there are sport smartwatches like the garmin epix 2 that have week of battery life whilst also having vastly more feature than the ultra and p it doe not look like a brick apple is not there yet especially for actual sport us
7792,rahim 12 ok maybe 5 7 is unrealistic but 4 5 is defiantly doable many other brand have proved a such
7793,keaton anderson i would fully take a few le of the smart feature for that longer battery life garmin style they last 4 5 day
7794,keaton anderson fr 5 7 day battery life is insane something that doesnt exist in any piece of tech anywhere

7991,i literally knew 99percent of these trick
7992,all commonly known feature
7993,too rushed and forget to show some tip
7994,plus but he sure would be very helpful for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing i am wanting to do something in special education so that is why i am looking at your video and seeing if they would work with him voiceover or some other accessibility thing so far no switch access on the watch why is that if you do not know and i switch is compatible with ice phone and apple watch i would say this allows the user who ha limited mobility to select an item and then if they wanted to plug in another switch device to activate that item they could also activate that i am with the same switch i think just use a different button on said switch i just wonder why apple ha not found that for the watch maybe the switch axis is the one handed mode idea you are talking about maybe they just called something different so that is ok however what if that person s hand is always clenched into a fist due to a disability but i can not open your finger i would like to switch would have to be use than likely i switch
7995,i am not finding anything about what you said on my own watch but would it be under touch accommodation i will check now to find out the only thing i get here after turning touch accommodation on is a message saying that if you have trouble using the touchscreen adjust the following option however the option are not shown i will try going back and finding out what option they would be it might not be available on my watch or in my region even seems pretty futuristic so sorry but i am afraid to comment is no good here i do not have that feature available i guess on this version of my apple watch is that or in my region in the united state missouri
7996,hate to say this but i have the apple watch series 2 it is a much older apple watch given to me by a well known friend i like it so far but i will see how your tip work while using voiceover if they do it all that is
7997,any update on this i am trying to find my series 2 i have it in storage somewhere and would like to try out these feature on that too let me know how it went for you

8063,every time i watch these kind of thumbnail hidden feature why do they hide their feature can any one explain

8077,you can setting gt display amp brightness gt wake on crown up now you can turn off wake on wrist raise and then if you scroll the crown up it will slowly increase the brightness

8102,congratulation you have been shortlisted among the winner of my ongoing giveaway reach out asap for package
8103,i am always disappointed with battery life of apple watch
8104,ryam they have but it is basic physic that limit it i think the battery ha more than enough on the series 8 and ultra it is a computer phone and walk in talkie on your wrist using it take power
8105,ahh but i mean why apple can not improve battery life
8106,ryam we are talking about non apple smart watch that do not do what an apple watch can do
8107,huawei smart watch last upto 10 day
8108,mine can go two day but i charge every morning while i am in the shower
8109,great video i do not have an apple watch but your video are always great
8110,thank you
8111,got the series 8 today and this video could not have come at a better time
8112,enjoy

8119,congratulation you have been shortlisted among the winner of my ongoing giveaway reach out asap for package
8120,mike how is it going with the pixel after these month are you missing your iphone awatch
8121,nice watch
8122,how can we make our video better
8123,chickensandcats wtf lol jaja
8124,use prettier girl
8125,honestly i hold your channel a the channel that others should model themselves after keep doing what you do mang
8126,motozest nice true
8127,do not have continuity error midway through the video shirt change from black to grey to black again
8128,i jus want a bigger apple watch that is bulletproof
8129,would love to have a chatgpt app to use at any time on my wrist would be game changer
8130,the only thing i expect is a far better battery life for both the 9 or x and the ultra
8131,it only detects temperature variation from the baseline you say that a if it is pointless it is for fertility period tracking which is pretty key for a whole lot of people on this planet d
8132,a smaller ultra would be cool
8133,it would be cool to have under the display solar panel for charging
8134,there is no such thing a series 9 they will jump directly to series 10
8135,the rumor leak from mark gurman wa that the blood sugar sensor wa out of the lab that it wa possible not that it wa imminent he said in an interview that he think it is still year away and that a blood pressure function is much closer to release a bmi calculator etc sound interesting
8136,i just bought the series 8
8137,i am going to upgrade from the 4 to the nine in july
8138,all i want is just a decent battery
8139,i want the gluclose i hate sticking my self
8140,i would be impressed to see it used with their ar device
8141,honestly samsung should implement this design to their watch series it is just more practical for a smart watch or give the option between either just for the pro model atleast would be
8142,aw x will be in 23 or 24
8143,yeah that wa my plan to buy a series 7
8144,on a series 4 maybe this is the year i upgrade
8145,huawei watch gt3 last for two week
8146,glucose sensor ha already been reported to be year away
8147,i just bought the apple watch ultra a few day ago should i return this in wait and get the new version or is it not gon na be that much of a change that i should just stick with what i have
8148,just a thought but with the 8 having added sensor is it no feasible that with the next update that changing one matrix not currently used to a different more useful one
8149,i will probably get the ultra first edition for a discounted price i have a series 4 but there is not enough design change to buy a series 9
8150,i have the apple watch 2 ceramic this watch is so beautiful and also 42mm give a better contrast between the coloured band and the white ceramic apple shoot reconsider the size bigger is not always better please apple focus on your design material and 3nm chip you apple are feature wise behind the competition amp that is fine a long a you go back to your 3 key essential design material amp usability
8151,i will never buy an apple watch without a blood pressure sensor
8152,i hope they put a more scratch resistance glass on the 9 i got the series 8 and it scratch so easily wa not expecting that had an amazon watch before the series 8 what wa only dollar200 did not had a scratch on the screen after a year of use my series 8 screen is full of scratch after 4 month for that kind of money i would have expected better glas on it really wa disappointed it scratch so easily i will buy the next ultra if they do not change that
8153,julie verreaulti tried putting on screen protector with the curved edge it is almost impossible to do there is not one good screen protector on the market for the apple watch at the moment
8154,je ne peux m me pa imaginer ne pa mettre un protecteur d cran c est de la pure n gligence
8155,bruhhhhhhhhhhhh i just bought maxed out series 8 a my very first smartwatch
8156,i would love it if they added the ability to check your blood pressure
8157,give me battery and a better fitness app
8158,smart band sound awesome i would want a band that move like a cod skin
8159,should i get se2 or 8
8160,apple change the colour of a product to red and the peasant descent how do you like that dollar799 colour
8161,i do not need a watch reminding me i am fat all day long i would pas on the bmi function
8162,it will be interesting to see when apple feel like they can manage air integration for scuba diver for the ultra definitely one of the missing feature compared to other dive computer or some of the better ui from garmin on health feature that give you some of the more useful interpretation on health data instead of just here is some number we can throw at you to improve the health fitness side of it
8163,bmi and glucose sensor would totally sell me new apple watch and i would upgrade from series 7
8164,wish they could make a non cellular stainless steel model i thought it would be neat but the phone company wanted to charge extra instead of using my unlimited data but i love the durability and non scratched screen i own a black s series 4
8165,with the amount of cash that apple ha it should just buy garmin like it bought beat
8166,what do you mean 9 it is going to be x
8167,at this point apple should start giving u more and more feature because competition like samsung is offering better design amp feature at le price
8168,i would much rather like face detection
8169,not a major upgrade coming from a series 7 but i came from a series 2 now i will wait till apple watch series 14
8170,bp needed
8171,prefer build in sensor
8172,good review i think that the blood pressure sensor and bmi since samsung already have it in their watch
8173,forget th band good show cheer
8174,i hope they can improve battery life or solar powered version
8175,it is just my opinion when someday apple make a round style smartwatch i will buy one i never liked square watch
8176,have you had a round smartwatch
8177,45mm ultra and a 49mm non ultra
8178,i guess there is no apple watch series 9 like no iphone 9
8179,i wonder if the ultra will get a second run this year considering it is price tag
8180,honestly i do not like how long the apple watch battery last pretty bad compared to competitor
8181,for the apple watch ultra none of the proposed band is ok for small wrist so apple should offer new band compatible with very small wrist i did not buy the ultra because of the band
8182,still rocking the series 4 and happy with it
8183,solar
8184,my wish list 1 cgm 2 body composition 3 bp 4 tue all day battery life of 24hrs without low power mode chance are apple will switch all production line to 3nm this barring any technical or yield issue
8185,improved battery life will probably be the reason why i am waiting for the series 9
8186,the ipad pro 12 9 inch update wa also very minor i have last year and i have no compelling reason to change for several year in fact my gen 2 pro 12 9 is still working fine a well aside from the screen cracking because my dog chewed it yep that really happened i bought both my kid last year ipad 12 9 at best buy for dollar300 le i have a terranyte on min which honestly wa a waste because i pay for cloud storage for my kid i just opted for 256g
8187,hopefully apple make a apple watch ultra in a smaller size like 42mm i think this could be a possibility because it would be different to the standard apple watch
8188,thank you for the great video roger federer is younger brother
8189,i am going on 62 and i will probably be dead before they get it right
8190,i would really prefer a blood pressure sensor a i think many would
8191,i looking for a smart watch that also track nap with sleep tracking
8192,iv the series 7 45mm i will not be upgrading for year no point it is actually getting boring now coz there running out of idea iv the 14 pro in gold that will do me for at least 5 year or more i upgraded from the 11 so it wa kind of worth it i think
8193,oh f these battery duration le than one day is just ridiculous
8194,if apple watch next year come with battery and solar they can compete better with garmin they would sell fast like hotcake
8195,wow you sound so similar to mrwhosetheboss
8196,ultra 2
8197,how can i find a apple watch 8 that ha a dead battery
8198,0 22 that band is so tight look like it is cutting off that guy is circulation lol just loosen it
8199,i just want to be able to facetime on my watch
8200,i have apple watch series 5 and after i have watched your video i will wait for the apple watch series 10
8201,apple ha really gone down hill the last few year
8202,watch ha 9 i thought straight to x series
8203,yeah and then there gon na be like dollar4269 for the just the normal one and then 50 000 for the pro plus ultra 69mm
8204,i do not know if the blood glucose monitoring is that easy to do they are trying for almost 10 year now and it will be a very big deal blood pressure it is easier to implement and is not a massive thing since a lot of smartwatches and smartbands have it still do not think that blood glucose will be sooner than 2025 because it is also market disruptive since there already are some medical approved very expensive glucose monitor sensor selling on the market right now
8205,42mm 45mm 48mm size would be much appreciated
8206,i have a 40mm series 4 and a very small wrist the 44 mm wa too big in my wrist so i have not upgraded to the ultra i just want a longer battery life
8207,i am waiting for the apple watch ultra pro max
8208,why doe this video feel sped up
8209,apple watch series 8 exists the apple watch series 9 is going to release and it is crazy
8210,both
8211,the iwatch 8 can measure your actual temperature it just report out a graph with variation from baseline because it is a new sensor and they are being cautious on how it is reporting until more is understood
8212,great video
8213,take away from this you should have just gotten the samsung watch 2 generation ago
8214,i have been a huawei smartwatch user for 5 year now and i wanted to change to apple because of the glucose sensor since the beginning of 2022 and it is yet to release lol
8215,id say the biggest improvement to the ultra can be the actual transferring of many more apps from your iphone to your watch so you can essentially justify the hefty price tag by being able to have somewhat of a portable cell phone on your wrist i got the ultra a my first apple watch ever because of the screen size although i like the 49mm display i know a lot of people will disagree with me here lol but i would love a 53 mm display for the screen size also again allow u to bring apps for the apple watch such a offerup snapchat facebook twitter instagram waze gps amazon ebay etc
8216,bosstay55 not really tho
8217,you can do that already there in the app store
8218,it ha been seen that bmi sensor and aura band may occur to be very inaccurate which is unacceptable for apple standard
8219,glucose will not happen next year stop lying
8220,i would like to be able to see my note on my watch and have different ringtone option or like when someone call you both your phone and watch go off have that for all notification i realize this is too much to expect but it would also be awesome if battery lasted at least 2 day
8221,lux hendricks the only time i have noticed that is with my alarm it is annoying i wish there wa a way to change it but i do like it if i am traveling or staying with someone so my alarm doe not wake them it only wake me i just wish i had more control over that
8222,i like so much more how simple fitbit notifies me my watch vibrates doe not make any sound and my phone go off like usual but i never liked how the apple watch mix it up depending on if i am wearing it and if i am looking at my phone and i do not like that i can not change the ringtone for call and message
8223,i get notification on both when i get a call it is always been that way it is one of my fav feature i get a vibration on my watch
8224,i would be interested in new case material such a cobalt chromium which would be more scratch resistant and providing a more premium finish also perhaps we will see an intermediate model between the ultra and non ultra model such a a pro model that ha an action button but not a recessed display i suspect the temperature sensor feature will be improved and used for improved sleep tracking
8225,stainless steel contains a minimum of 11percent chromium and cobalt chromium alloy have been used to make ring for a while now btw
8226,cobalt chromium are not safe metal to work with or for u to have on our skin
8227,personally i think the s8 is the intermediate model most people can get by with the se2 the s8 is better built and ha a few extra feature aka being a pro and the ultra is equivalent to the macbook pro which is for people who are a seriously into apple product or b people who make money off a job that relies on them
8228,i can confirm from experience with the gear s3 s4 and s5 that the battery life on samsung watch is misleading i can barely get 1 5 day and this with low power mode low brightness they are not defect watch went to samsung got replacement it just how they are
8229,i want 5g s and some biometrics tbh
8230,the series 8 wa an extremely disappointing release so i expect they will make up for it with the series 9
8231,since series 5 nothing ha got my attention for sure an integrated glucose pressure sensor would change that not on a band so yes i am willing to wait but hey i have already been waiting for about 3 year so far what is one more year
8232,you are taking samsung is word on the 5 lasting 50 hour noway
8233,i hope the apple watch ultra 2 have two size like 45mm and 49mm
8234,47mm is the perfect size
8235,esku75 i agree
8236,it would be perfect maybe 46mm
8237,when is the blood pressure device coming on the iapple watch
8238,this year i am getting a series 8 apple watch from a 3 so i am exited and i think they should do the band a a external battery for way better better life
8239,i used to not like the style of your video i actually unsubscribed awhile back and when i saw your video come up i wa like i will give it another go i am glad i did awesome video quality and great info
8240,apple can kill all the series and focus on the ultra and se version
8241,tech news not hypothetical
8242,can you use a regular band from the other apple watch on the ultra i do not like the current ultras band
8243,yes
8244,are not you about a year to early with anything related to series 9
8245,too bad apple watch still doesnt have blood pressure monitor
8246,the real question is will there actually be an apple watch 9 or will it be skipped like the iphone 9
8247,frand chai i do not know if i would laugh or cry if they introduce an apple watch with the dynamic island
8248,tomas plunksnis i think most people would like to have the name back just not the notch
8249,frand chai that actually sound really cool i also thought the 10th ipad will be named the ipad x but that doe not sound nearly a cool a the iphone x or the apple watch series x
8250,apple watch series x
8251,skipping w9 sticking with my w6
8252,this is pointless and unsubstantiated there have not been any leak thus far and we will not see anything until at least february
8253,7 29 i think they should make smart band is with apple watch 9
8254,samsung is trash when it come to measurement
8255,a band with extra battery would be nice
8256,okay soon i have an apple watch 4 soo which should i do wait for 9 or get the 8
8257,glucose sensor and it will be an upgrade for me
8258,maybe it is me but how the hell can a watch apple or otherwise measure your bmi
8259,wish the ultra get a midnight or black color
8260,i smashed the like love your work
8261,i would rather have a built in sensor later
8262,the series 3 for me wa the best one then the series 5 nowadays i feel like i am more inclined to look for a third party smart watch
8263,built in sensor for sure sound tiring to change band all the time
8264,i wish apple would make a fitness tracker their power efficiency in a tracker would yield awesome battery life and i just want a tracker that is optimized for apple health
8265,the galaxy watch 5 doe not last 50 hour lol what
8266,give u the darn glucose sensor
8267,id like to see other material on the gps version other than aluminum
8268,lose the biometrics
8269,thank you for the review daniel if the next iteration of apple watch include the smart connector for it wrist band it could easily incorporate battery within the band for longer use one could then swop between conventional wrist band over battery equipped one depending on use case scenario
8270,1 16 you have said that the a16 chip is a 5nm processor it is a 4nm processor thank you
8271,apple will focused on battery life this time apple watch series 9 s9 chip based on 5nm technology bmi sensor new band apple watch ultra 2 s9 chip based on 3nm technology bmi sensor new color new band
8272,lol no way they will do one chip with different nm tech
8273,a bmi sensor there is no such thing the bmi is merely a calculation between high and weight and a useless one at that i have a freiend who is a body builder who is bmi wa stating he wa obese yet he wa 5percent body fat
8274,expectation hurt do not expect
8275,1 17 correction it is 4nm
8276,i do not think thered be series 9 iphone didnt even have a line up for their 9th phone but skipped it instead so i think apple watch series x or 10 coz it better have redesign and stuff
8277,ultra in 42mm please
8278,what about the apple watch se 3 i have apple watch se 1th generation
8279,there is absolutely zero chance for a glucose sensor do your research
8280,my mom and i just bought 2 apple watch se 2 watch for ourselves after her series 3 ran out of onboard storage but after i had already completed the purchase then she noticed the product red series 8 lol
8281,next year apple watch ultra pro max 2
8282,i will wait for the ultra 2
8283,hmm better battery sound great but i would also like a 44mm watch ultra the current watch ultra is too big
8284,so you are saying just buy a series 7 for 200 on ebay
8285,will there be any update to watch ultra next year
8286,not for the next 2 3 year imo
8287,1 16 wrong the a16 is based on 4nm process
8288,what about a new design
8289,im getting the apple watch ultra 49mm titanium case gps cellular trail loop blue grey next month im so excited
8290,a16 is transistor size is not 5nm it is 4nm
8291,tony greco no the a16 is world first smartphone with 4nm
8292,tony greco yes i know
8293,luka bo njak no it 5nm try googling again
8294,thiss
8295,you do not measure bmi with a sensor lol bmi is just a number on a chart some ppl came up with that corresponds to a pair of height and weight measurement not a very useful metric anyway
8296,the ultra is my fav apple watch by far only thing i would upgrade it for is a darker color black titanium please next year
8297,i hope the series 9 do not cost twice a much a the series 8
8298,when the battery it s gon na last 1 week i ll buy one
8299,i do not know why but you remind me of roger federer lol
8300,apple watch ultra is the worst product of the year they need to drastically decrease the size and improve the power efficiency to actually make it usable
8301,with my ultra i get almost 3 day with regular use
8302,what if they stop and get rid of the series 8 and only have an ultra and se
8303,yes
8304,i do not see the design changing anytime soon folk were predicting huge jump since the s7 and that did not happen with even with the s8 the battery life improvement would be cool but nothing worth waiting for if at all most change will probably come with the watch ultra 2
8305,the apple watch design it great and more practical than any other round watch honestly
8306,there will not be any series 9 it probably will be called apple watch x
8307,but it is not the 10 year of apple watch
8308,apple watch
8309,i mean he might be right apple always skip the number 9
8310,the iphone 9 wa skipped because the year the x wa launched wa apple 10 year anniversary so the aw 9 should be called the aw 9 and not aw x
8311,it is actually the apple watch series 9 but watchos 10
8312,i will say this a a kinesiology major that bmi is an inaccurate way to measure your individual body composition and is meant to measure the population a a whole a person who is extremely muscular may get a similar bmi value a someone who is obese therefore it really doe not properly gauge an individual is bmi
8313,your nose is very shiny
8314,the never ending cycle of the next new thing
8315,i do not know if movement tracking ha improved since the s5 but i would like improved movement tracking currently on my s5 it is really annoying trying to get raise to siri to work and also something basic like taking screenshots is also really hard to be consistent or even work but that doe not have to do with movement tracking i did not know about the aura band so that is definitely something i will be checking out
8316,i am still sporting my s5 a well just not worth it enough to upgrade
8317,what do you think will happen when we reach 1nm chip lol
8318,picometer pm femtometer fm and attometers am are all smaller than nanometer
8319,the funny u meter of number
8320,we will get 5 nm chip
8321,then let is wait iwatch 9
8322,i got a mint unactivated but unboxed black s7 for gbp250 a few month ago so great man
8323,do you even know what bmi mean you have to manually enter your weight and height and with a simple calculator you can get your bmi
8324,he mean body composition
8325,a16 is based on 4nm process not 5nm
8326,it is just rebranded 5nm
8327,the watch design look so dated now desperately need a redesign for 9
8328,don taylor yeah the ultra look great
8329,that is y i chose the ultra
8330,built in sensor
8331,since your bmi will not change throughout the day why would you need a sensor on your watch having smart connector would allow medical device inventor create specialized band which leverage the display and connectivity
8332,i got the ultra this year and although it wa very expensive i love it much more durable better battery life and perfect screen size
8333,sigma fact
8334,camila smithson a week is income hmm but yeah it still money a part of earning dollar15k a month after giving out all the tax it is still an expensive piece of technology
8335,expensive it costed me a weekly income although yeah i love the alarm and the bigger case not to mention the battery it went from 100percent to 0percent in about 3 day and it charge extremely fast when i have for example 30percent i just charge it while i shower and it is already at 100percent when i put it on again
8336,the temperature sensor is quite literally useless if you are a male why even introduce it
8337,there is one thing i doubt is the bmi sensor on any smart watch accurate according to my knowledge none of these support accurate measurement of bmi
8338,measuring blood pressure on a wrist watch is really difficult with today is technology need to wait
8339,no upgrade till space gray will return
8340,hi dan i will be upgrading next year got to keep up with the tech i am hooked now just hope battery life is better than the 8 though compared to my old 6 it is a lot better xx
8341,the composition sensing on watching and scale for that matter are not very accurate at all
8342,need a new design of the non ultra version
8343,2024 is the year for that it is a three year cycle a explained in the video
8344,space black apple watch ultra 2 would be wonderful because i do not like the current color of the ultra
8345,emil secker i had the series 7 in black titan no scratch and no chiping after 1 year but i think for heavy user the black would be not a great
8346,juliushxn the black would chip so badly
8347,emil secker yes sure they have but i would still prefer if the ultra 2 ist also offered in black
8348,they probs decided on a lack of colour for a reason
8349,the a16 is 4 nm
8350,a16 chip is 4nm not 5nm 1 15
8351,zoneoftech thanks good to know
8352,it is technically still 5nm tsmc is n4 process but marketed a 4nm however it is still 5
8353,i have always imagined an apple watch with smart connector and tiny battery in the strap to extend battery life
8354,i need an apple watch ultra of le size
8355,i would love to see a upgraded apple watch ultra with more battery power and few additional change to make it more interesting
8356,look nice
8357,first

8391,link iphone 14 pro review 6 month later io 16 review 6 month later all of our apple video read this review purchase link apple watch series 8 iphone 14 pro why we sleep view all of our favorite product follow josh reddit instagram linkedin post news mastodon twitter
8392,so i had a question i have the apple watch series 8 and i wa thinking about turning my phone plan off for a while if i keep my apple watch cellular plan can i still receive call on my iphone through my watch without an iphone cellular plan
8393,it ok but the battery is terrible unfortunately
8394,my fossil last all week with everything kept on one day is not impressive lol
8395,i bought the stainless steel milanese loop series 7 new for dollar459 on amazon would recommend that over series 8 aluminum if you care about premium design amp material and not much about the 2 added feature in series 8
8396,awesome video bro keep up the good work that last feature you mention about the crown and audio is increasing try rotating your apple watch the other way but switching the orientation and making the crown face the other side but down cause when your hand move up and down it can prolly cause the watch crown to move or rotate but great video explaination god bless
8397,is it possible to answer a call and talk via series 8 gps watch while connected via bluetooth with an iphone
8398,yes you can take a phone call on the watch while connected to an iphone via bluetooth
8399,ultra is titanium
8400,i am standing by my old adage if the watch can not replace the phone then there is no point you need an iphone to set the watch up and update it
8401,why would you want a watch to replace the phone doing everything on the watch would be so cumbersome and uncomfortable it is pitched a an iphone accessory and that is all it should be
8402,what is new on series 8 that is not available already on series 7
8403,6 month later how are you a youtuber lol spo2 been on since series 6
8404,6 month later screen size is the same it changed from 6 to 7 and now remained same size
8405,cycle tracking spo2 car crash detection larger screen i think that is it again it wa a pretty iterative update to the apple watch this year and even more so if you already have a series 7 josh
8406,for me it feel s like the 8 is the same a the 7
8407,people rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing dale carnegie
8408,how many percent is your series 4 battery capacity after 4 year
8409,mine wa 85percent but changed it 2 year ago now it is 94percent going to use for 2 more year
8410,why would you buy the stainless steel over the ultra being the same price almost make no sense
8411,for me the ultra is too big and i do not care for the atheistic a much a the series 8 josh
8412,take up one idea make that one idea your life think of it dream of it live on that idea let the brain muscle nerve every part of your body be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone this is the way to success swami vivekananda
8413,still no blood pressure monitor

8439,can you use invoicing tradesman apps on these watch
8440,i go to bed with my girlfriend every single day not such an innocent flex bro
8441,i use a stainless steel series 4 that my friend gave me my main interest is to track my sleep and my exercise when i go for bike ride which i try to do everyday for at least 10 mile sometimes it get a bit slow using spotify but i wear it all day everyday it work perfect for me for sure a new one would be faster and nice but this one is doing great i charge it twice a day usually when i shower or i am having food and that is it i can definitely recommend any gen from the 4th one
8442,when you make sex with your girlfriend you wear it
8443,expensive boring overrated
8444,i can not turn off the sound of alarm can u show me how to do it
8445,well made video
8446,i just ordered my first apple watch last night after resisting for so long it wa on sale at target plus i get an employee discount so it wa a good deal that i could not pas up i really only want to track my workout and step so that is why i resisted for so long and went with a fitbit cuz i did not need it to do all the extra stuff it ha but the se sounded like a decent device for what i wanted even though it probably still ha too many feature this video though make me kinda excited for all the extra stuff it can do i just got so fed up with fitbit and the company is refusal to update anything so it wa time to move on
8447,buy a 7 or later for the fast charging if you can 33percent is a small improvement technically but it went from me using the se just for run to wearing the 7 all day and night and just charging when i am in the shower
8448,one piece g o a t
8449,i am more interested in how you do freelancing in japan a a foreigner problem a taxing paying etc how do you deal with those detail can you make video about it
8450,my se is 2 5 month old and it already broke down 2 time it is so unreliable i feel so stupid for buying a euros350 watch that literally break in such a small amount of time now i really hate the watch and i am going to use my old garmin watch again that never broke down in 3 5 year lol
8451,but when it work it is a great watch
8452,do you have any scratch
8453,can u take a shower with it
8454,do you need to have your iphone nearby to use your apple watch or is it completely stand alone i am new to apple watch i had an iphone 4 and an iphone 6 year ago and i just bought an iphone 13 i am looking forward to optimalising the automation and usability of it
8455,if your watch is a gps model i e without cellular function or not set up with cellular it would not be able to access the internet without an iphone cellular version can but it drain your watch is battery if you have the cellular version and set up the plan you can use it stand alone for phone call streaming music with bluetooth and using map other than that you would need your iphone
8456,how about degradation of battery in this 800 day is posible to replace it at an apple store
8457,got mine free from apple developer academy so i am very happy i got my first ever smartwatch and i have been hearing nothing but good thing about this i do not really mind the battery life so yeahh
8458,i ordered series 7 any problem
8459,what is the battery health percentage after 800 day
8460,santiago sedlacek nice mean it is actually worth to invest in an apple watch
8461,guneet singh i used it heavily today 3 hour walk and i made it to nighttime with like 5percent of the battery so i just charge it when i sit on my desk and put it back on
8462,santiago sedlacek kind of like 800 day equal approx 3 yr and 1600 cycle still doing good at 83percent wow

8499,i also watch one piece and really trying to catch up after i let wano arc done first so ur opinion regarding this watch is matter am getting one right now hopefully we will meet in japan
8500,i got my 2022 se a couple of week ago i wa excited to try the sleep tracker woke up in the middle of the night with a burn tried moving it off to the side but had to move it to right wrist when i woke up i had a tiny dot from where the sensor is i looked it up and people have had worse burn so annoying i guess it is not very common and you can loosen the band but when sleeping i am sometimes lying in a way that will push the watch to the skin i am thinking about returning it great video like other in the comment bro do you have a link to the wrist band
8501,v a i n change the strap maybe it will resolve the issue stay safe
8502,andrei t thanks good to hear i think it is rare but if you search you will find people showing way worse than my tiny dot hehe but most of them are nickel allergy from the strap itself i tried it for sleep tracking again and it is clearly irritating my skin if ever so slightly but that could be from the initial burn i will not be wearing it to bed again but it is ok i do not care and it is nice to have the watch on my bedside table fully charged
8503,wow i m sorry to hear that i have an apple watch series 7 and never encountered this issue
8504,thank you for your video
8505,bought my very first apple watch se 2 last month i got really disappointed with the screen i accidentally dropped the watch just above my hip and the screen got broke easily the screen is quality is really terrible but all the feature and technical specification are excellent i am just annoyed with the screen
8506,man that suuucks i think maybe it wa one of those just bad luck drop i have dropped my phone and nothing happened but this one time i wa tying my shoe so lower than hip height and it fell out of my pocket landed on the hallway rug and i do not know if it hit a pebble or something but the screen cracked anyways i got one of those screen protector for my new se not so much for the screen part but bumping into stuff i would hate to scratch the finish

8650,awesome review
8651,you are a year younger than me and ive had a few health scare myself i know this sound weird but your video have motivated me to get an apple watch and start moving again btw i hope you are doing better
8652,love you
8653,quick tip for my fellow menstruators if you use apple is tracker and plan on using the temp sensor feature to enhance tracking consider waiting until after the holiday before you buy this watch or enable the feature my tracking wa pretty accurate before but last month the estimation wa a week later than reality it feel like it is been areset by the watch and need more time in order to become accurate again right now it is estimating for me to start on thanksgiving and christmas and i have no idea if that is true or not this is anecdotal of course but seriously if what you are doing right now work consider leaving it alone till after the holiday edit 1 month later after the first inaccurate cycle it seems on track again not enough time to say it is more accurate than before but it is already back to the same accuracy a before what a relief i had a cold and fever a couple week ago and wondered how it might affect the conclusion of the algorithm but it seemed to handle that just fine without getting thrown off the temperature spike is visible on the graph it would be nice if they could use this capability in a future update to maybe alert for the presence of fever after learning an individual is baseline temp
8654,woq
8655,i like the gold watch is starlight gold
8656,i like the gold watch is starlight gold

8713,personally i think goodness that apple make the watch because i would hate to be stuck with samsung or google is option or even fitbit the only reason i switched to an iphone wa because of my apple watch and i know that sound crazy but that is just how good it is and you do not have to get a new one every year so people get mad if there is not some crazy new phenomenon design with these watch each year they are ready so good there is not a whole lot to do but just finesse it and make it better
8714,good insight and so much depth both looked great on you well done
8715,how many apple watch do you have
8716,congratulation you won a free iphone 14 and a macbook pro and apple watch series 8 in today is ongoing giveaway contest kindly message above to claim your prize
8717,already any update on the temperature stuff
8718,it is pretty crazy to me that the apple watch doe not have a daily step goal and achievement for reaching your daily step goal a certain amount of day in a row i know i can download a separate app for it but i feel like that is something so many people want and that i should not have to download a separate app for it
8719,justine i finally got the apple watch series 8 and i am really like it a lot
8720,one thing i have not been able to get along with on digital phone is the fact when it is sunny and you look at your watch you can not see the time compared to an analogue real watch where you can see the watch face clearly is this phone any different
8721,thank you for the gender neutral language and a great review here is to your health
8722,you are so beautiful

8724,9 31 nice ad for hoka running shoe there justine those definitely arent cheap
8725,hi justine great review i am glad that the apple watch ha saved your life after all this when you talk about your blood clot story and all that what i am worried to say well out of my heart i will make a video about this a you know this and the medication and all and yet talk about pregnancy yet i am a man and yet i guess i am a bit scared of confidence a my idea to have a family and my idea to make my youtube channel big a i will tell when i can meet you and since i read your book a 2nd time it seems more that i could remember also you did a video about lizzie valezquez and now i could say i have someone who is a relative of mine he life in tampa florida his name is david rodriguez who lost his leg due to what might be a i could say you try to help me out not to eat too many sweet because of diabetes and that also ran into my family a i am afraid if i eat to many sugary food i could get it but in a way justine thank for the video about blood clot i could understand that but ever since then i knew that what i read about you and what you do i feel something within me i am scared because i may not be ready but helping me succeeding my youtube channel could yet have confidence like product that rock video to try new thing is like someone comment on my video but is not the same feeling yet i knew some young dutch woman comment on my video but yet my heart pound towards one woman if yet my goal are and what i want is this i would like to go to other country especially japan i would love to win a contest at america is got talent dancing tango and you becomes my partner i also want to get 1 000 subscriber on my channel and probably earn money i want a gf a significan not other to be faithful with and to propose marriage and be loyal to the woman i love so that seems to be you justine i like you justine and i love you this is something i feel and yet i bet we could meet probably at time square in new york city during new year eve to kiss or in colombia rehearsal with alvaro alonzo my dance teacher who thought me tango and yet you taking lesson and see you move is going to be like a beautiful butterfly what i could say justine is that i really like you take care justine i love you miguel
8726,wohoo jessica and dustin are my fave trainer great review thank you glad you are feeling better i am looking to upgrade because i have series 4 and the battery life is not ideal for sleep tracking for health reason so highly considering upgrading do not think i need ultra but the battery life on ultra look very appealing too

8730,this watch look good but today we see battery life in week not 7 to 14 hr
8731,thanks for another great video glad you are ok and now even more conscious of your fitness hey i have a tip that i wa kind of surprised you did not mention when using the apple watch to find your phone if you hold that button down instead of just tapping it your phone make the same sound and the camera light start to blink a well super cool helpful when looking for your phone in the dark like the timei it fell under my seat in the movie theater i wa so happy not to have to be feeling around the gross floor with my hand for where my phone wa lol anyway hope that is a helpful reminder for others

8796,caught covid 19 last year that resulted in a pulmonary embolism scary stuff
8797,please do a video for the girlies on setting up basal body temp tracking for ovulation prediction i am so confused
8798,hey i did not see the bike adaptor link in your description
8799,doe the aluminum and the stainless steel have all the same feature except for wireless charging
8800,hmmm your ecg look weird o o
8801,i am using apple watch 8 for the last 6 day whenever i am riding the bike the watch automatically go into outdoor cycle mode when the speed of my bike is 20km hr it go to exersice count which is wrong ijustine
8802,great video thanks for sharing about your health and way the helped you seek medical treatment sooner today i upgraded from a series 1 to 8 it certainly wa long overdue but it is such a great watch i did not mind being stuck with watchos 6 for a few year if the screen wa not fading dimming on one half section and the watch face not burnt into the led panel i would keep using it for another year i only wish upgraded the s8 sip chip with a faster one rather than being marginally similar to the s6 s7 still the 8 is nice change keep up the great work
8803,just bought apple 8 red getting tomorrow
8804,what ring doe she use
8805,oh wow goodness
8806,she got a blood clot because she most likely jabbed but she is not gon na say that
8807,what do you guy think of upgrading to series 8 from series 7 like i wa thinking of getting an oura ring for the temperature measure capability but now that apple came up with it i might just get the new watch i like keeping track of my cycle and day or am i being too irresponsible with my money lol
8808,hmmm tbh i trust apple more than oura with this they just have more data to train their algorithm to be accurate but maybe take my opinion with a grain of salt because i have a grudge against oura for keeping the data behind a paywall i find this just insulting and to be a really shitty business model neither oura not apple actually measure basal temperature of your body only skin level temperature so they need to do a lot of mathematical shenanigan to actually make a prediction if you want super high accuracy maybe look into natualcycles regular thermometer otherwise honestly i would opt for apple
8809,i am here to see justine who care for apple
8810,that is an amazing gig being the demo person for all that fitness stuff free peloton apple stuff very cool love the apple watch review mine is on order
8811,first promote the thing that most likely gave you a clot then promote a product that might help you with it nice
8812,you have the band upside down
8813,abit too much since the 8 is completely the same a the 7
8814,the apple screen you have on your tv is that solely through the apple tv app or do you actually need an apple tv device probably a stupid question but i have never had one so yeah
8815,ok strong selling point in the start of the video
8816,how many jab
8817,probably 4
8818,hi justine i am a longtime cyclist and matt wilpers is absolutely great suggestion you should raise your seat you should only have a slight bend in your knee when extended almost wont even notice the bend for a proper fit great video a always
8819,will you review watch ultra
8820,i watched this after i upgrade to the series 8 from the series 3 and it is such a huge difference i also got the solo loop band which is so comfortable
8821,i am definitely getting the new apple watch i almost drown in july while kayaking my wife put her apple watch on me and we were able to track what wa happening during the hour long drive then we were able to show the er what wa going on my blood oxygen got down to 90percent and hr to 139 for over 1 2 hr ecg wa all over the place
8822,the packaging is ridiculous they could easily cut the packaging by 50percent if they were not so lazy and keeping jony is incredibly wasteful flat box
8823,so sorry about your health issue it is just an assumption but is it maybe because the cvd vaccine just a thought
8824,i like the built in barometer of the new apple watch series 8 to detect sharp change in atmospheric pressure such a airbag deployment in a serious car crash do to the distracted driver looking at their apple watch series 8
8825,is a wristwatch really useful
8826,goodluck to seeing ijustine thique one day
8827,hi justine where can i buy the same ring u have with sensing
8828,i have been a long time user of the garmin watch line so i am excited to give an apple watch a chance this fall thanks for the review it really helped me

8839,i enjoy justine is review she is very concise and in depth i have the series 7 and believe it will still continue to be good for me
8840,really upset i did not know the temperature tracking wa only for sleeping i would have just went with the series 7 if i knew that smh lol
8841,the reason i do not have a apple watch is because you can not get cellular on apple watch were i live in europe so it is basically pointless for me but if they do introduce cellular to the apple watch of course i would buy one

9000,i love my apple watch but apple need to reduce the amount of packaging for the apple watch it is ridiculous how much packaging they use it could be an eighth of the size of packaging
9001,i am a little jealous although i guess i should not be i preordered the series 8 and wa supposed to get it today release day but unfortunately something happened with my payment with amazon shopping card so i had to cancel and reorder but i ended up seeing some series 7 deal one wa in starlight for 100 dollar off and i ended up with the blue i have been wanting for 60 dollar cheaper brand new now i wa really excited about the new crash detection and the possibility of an update for the temp sensor getting more us than just woman is health which i am not nocking it is awesome i just can not take advantage of that lol but i did end up with basically the same watch but in the color i wanted i did have midnight ordered a little sad about that but the series 7 blue is plus i wa able to save money which tbh i needed not to mention i am upgrading my series 3 after a test year to see if i would actually use apple watch and i love it lap my ring every day just about think i made a mistake nah it wa a good decision i am just getting fomo great video

9126,well the point of a review is to be unbiased not to hype you up if it wa meant to hype you up that would be called an ad lmao of course they are gon na talk about the downside in a real review
9127,can not wait for your apple watch ultra review pre ordered the ultra last week this will be my first watch ever so hope it is great lol

9156,i have the apple watch 2 series so it is quite old i have been saving up for an apple watch and i am excited for the series 8 i have a lot of reproductive health issue and if i am honest i am really excited for the temperature cycle sensing feature
9157,brilliant review justine great to see you out training
9158,come on there is nothing that different from the 7 do not buy this
9159,amazing video a always also want that blue jacket
9160,480p why
9161,wa going to ask about aura ring worth having now with new watch
9162,2 02 my grandma ha hand like that
9163,congratulation you won
9164,i liked your presentation so much
9165,congratulation you won
9166,the new apple watch series 8 look amazing
9167,congratulation you won
9168,hi justine what is the bike adapter i do not see the link in the description
9169,hi love your video it is very good review i have an apple watch series 6 shall i upgrade or not
9170,glad you are ok and thanks for the review x
9171,congratulation you won
9172,what a great review
9173,nice video
9174,congratulation you won
9175,i have to say tho i am a samsung user i do like apple product and i really like this review for it even if i can not get it i think the apple watch is a good product i wish they made open for non iphone user i would definitely get one i love the fitness work shown here look fun
9176,how is the watch 5 pro
9177,i have a series 5 and i still think it not worth it to upgrade
9178,definitely one of your best video to date love all the health topic you discussed
9179,i have a series 4 with a quickly declining battery i am a huge apple fan but the cool feature of the series 5 6 7 8 just have not been enough to justify the upgrade price without a redesign i think i will either pay for a battery replacement or go for the ultra i ski at an advanced level go backpacking hike all the time do plenty of other outdoor sport and could use the extra long battery life for long hospital shift just got ta decide if i want to pay dollar800 for that
9180,amazing video
9181,i am so glad you are ok you have great review looking forward to the next
9182,very good
9183,hii justin can you tell me which watch is best to buy series8 apple ultra or apple se
9184,how many time did she say excited
9185,i am sooo excited shuuuut the hell up u fakest girl on the internet
9186,the overreacting queen is back with health sympathy wow way to go
9187,hopefully getting the silver 45mm tomorrow morning i am gon na make sure to be there first
9188,give me one watch
9189,i did not know you had a dvt i had one in 2016 the pain in my leg wa unbearable it then went to my lung and i spent a month in the hospital i always thought it wa something that happens to older people but i wa only 32 at the time and i have always been very active
9190,i still do not trust the number i get when i lift weight i lift heavy and after 30 minute it say i only burnt 130 calorie
9191,the ultra look a good choice for some but for me would look hideous on my thin woman sized wrist i find the standard model look overall just a smarter looking watch that i can wear everyday and with more smarter clothes especially with the stainless steel model i find the stainless steel model is a really versatile model a you can really change the look of the watch for whatever type of clothes you are wearing for example when i wear more casual clothes i wear with the braided solo loop of my black sport band whereas when i dress more smarter i put on my leather strap or the stainless steel bracelet strap the ultra look like something i could not wear everyday and more like something to wear before you do some extreme sport diving that is why i have went with the s8 45mm stainless steel
9192,hi sorry i am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo late
9193,the problem with smart watch nowadays are the battery more feature consume more battery and there are not any fast charging definitely a bummer
9194,great video a always thank you for the update on the watchos new feature especially the medication reminder wow i do take daily medication and can not remember if i have done so or not this feature is going to be super helpful thanks justine

9210,love your video and info your a huge icon and glad to see someone being positive and helping others while we are here
9211,thanks for this fantastic review i can not wait to get my ultra one thing i still have not managed though is hooking up my watch to the ipad to have a bigger screen when doing my fitness workout t t
9212,what should i upgrade to from my first gen se it overheats and i hate it
9213,ultra please
9214,gift me the series 7 you replaced namesake
9215,it is nice to see you too today
9216,fantastic review of the new feature
9217,i love how simple it wa for justine to be inclusive in her language once you start using it daily it is so nice
9218,i just wish they would some how add blood pressure feature
9219,hello ultra when
9220,series 8 look incredible but ultra is gon na be even more better
9221,why is apple watch all about fitness all i wanted one for is notification and to control my music and apple pay that is it i turned off all the fitness stuff se2 should of had aod i have had two apple watch now s0 and s5 but got rid of it because in the winter i can not get to my watch so did not see the point in keeping it
9222,thank you
9223,it is funny tomorrow i get to open my own se 2 and my wife is getting a series 8 it is like a sneak peek
9224,thinking about going back to the apple watch how is it with audiobooks and music can you stream them while you are out on a walk without having your phone with you
9225,i think steve job faked his death got a sex change and now he go by the name justine
9226,you can tell there is barely any change because this is like a review for apple fitness instead of the series 8 justine just doe not like criticising the product in anyway a worried about being cut off my apple so it is a very broad and vague review bcus there is not actually that much to talk about
9227,not saying her content is not enjoyable a i like her positive approach but there just is not that much to say here about the watch 8 so it is diverted onto apple fitness instead to avoid showing how small of an upgrade it is but still nice to watch positive video atleast
9228,i have got the first se and i wa thinking to upgrade to the se 2 but i do not think i will a their practically the same which is a shame
9229,yoga open door for demon in your life protect your health with jesus please he will give you the protection and safety
9230,give me your old one
9231,hope
9232,stainless version is better aluminium make it look cheap i wonder why the ultra is not stainless
9233,all these are not affordable for the common man
9234,anyone who ha a period might be easier to just say woman
9235,thanks for being vulnerable to share your health scare story i am also on daily medication so it is good to hear what is happening with watch os9 on that front with regard to the review it seems like the review wa also apple fitness in addition to the watch and i do not know that the series 8 is advertised a having any better battery life than the series 7
9236,this is a great demonstration of the iphone 14 video image stabilization
9237,which size is it plz

9343,doe she have other job other than being a youtuber
9344,congratulation you won
9345,i am looking for the link to the phone holder you were referring to on your peleton i did not see it in the description
9346,congratulation you won
9347,hola miss justine and everyone
9348,so i want my first apple watch should i get a series 7 se 2 or series 8 mainly want to use the fitness and health aspect of the watch to improve my lifestyle series 8 is out of budget but is it worth it se 2 lack some feature i want but is cheap and series 7 is old but is it still good
9349,i would go for the se2 series 7 ha been discontinued on the apple website in store at least the store i work at but if you are able to find a s7 go for it
9350,a for me to start with i would get se 2 and then later you can trade it in to save money that way
9351,perfect stainless steel though is my beloved
9352,unbox the ultra version justine
9353,action mode is worse than normal when you are filming yourself because it try to keep the background steady while your face is going up and down
9354,everyone with a period if only we had a word for that
9355,informative but also funny and entertaining great video
9356,i wonder what apple review would look like when old school youtubers are like in their 80 is
9357,plz review galaxy watch 5 pro also
9358,i have a series 5 and i am still not compelled to upgrade seems like most of the new feature are software driven anyway maybe the 9 will be a better upgrade
9359,everyone with a period why is everyone saying this are we not allowed to just say woman these day
9360,blindmango transgender people have been a part of reality for several year thousand even you genuinely seem to be insanely ignorant so ima be light on you but like fr go learn a thing or two holy crap
9361,sixela marenco ah i definitely am not close minded when it come to trying to define what being transgender mean for the person or what they experience i am not comparing it with a mental health issue here but i feel it doe relate in the aspect of if you have never dealt with it personally you will never really know what it is like you can only be accepting open minded and kind i just worry with the way thing can be sometimes at what point is being offended on someone else is or on a demographic behalf that you do not belong to personally belong to begin undermining them entirely and going against what you are trying to stand for if you like i feel the most vocal people when being offended by something whether it is race gender etc related are people that have zero relation to the very thing they are being offended for
9362,sixela marenco no i do completely understand that or at least to the point of understanding i will never understand not being one however i feel being offended by someone referring to woman having period or female is really focusing on the wrong thing being biologically female is not something to be ashamed of even if you are transgender that is part of your story and the reality of the situation
9363,sixela marenco of course it doe not make a woman and woman why are you making point and arguing against them in the same sentence are you a twitter spawn by any chance everyone that ha a period also ha a female anatomy and is biologically a woman if that offends you then i am sorry but that is reality there is absolutely no shame in someone who is transgender being biologically a woman especially on the topic of period
9364,fahrai bless you you know if you are trans your body part do not just instantly poof and you are still biologically a woman right why is there so much shame in this i have nothing against being trans but what you declare yourself to be and what you actually biologically are are not the same thing which is exactly why there is the term transgender there should not be any shame in that because that is reality
9365,than watch i man extcing to your expression and your excitement
9366,great now u can gift me that
9367,i have decided to buy the new apple watch series 8 but i am not sure what size should i order the 41mm or the 45mm i have a small wrist about 150mm can anybody give me an advise

11224,i wa not looking for a ad about ebates
11225,do you have to keep bluetooth on on your phone once you have your watch paired with your phone thanks
11226,kaylyn legrand yes blue tooth connects ur phone with ur watch for notification however if u turn off bluetooth near wifi like at ur house then ur apple watch will hook up to the wifi and give u a green cloud
11227,kaylyn legrand i am wondering the same thing
11228,i wa in the apple store today and the watch can not be setup without an iphone which mean the apple watch is distinctly an iphone peripheral which i think is a bad design choice especially for modern time when an tablet device can do everything a phone can an more for instance i can call people using facebook messenger which begs serious question of using a mobile phone service provider but that is another topic consider that the ipod mini ha a display and a designer made an app and case that allowed it to be used a a stand alone watch many should feel uneasy having to own an iphone to use the watch most smart watch distinctly can independently be used a a watch and computing device you can download apps onto and then also take advantage of the feature that allow it to be used a a smart phone peripheral
11229,fissle wine well million of u already own iphones always have always will it enhances the experience that ha made a great impact on many people life i am apple considered the watch being used without the iphone i suggest if interested before submitting final judgment you try it for a week and return it if your not happy or buy one of many avail stand alone watch
11230,tibokio lol
11231,well that is apple for ya i guess keeping it all inside the one ecosystem

11578,ben nichols gaming are you serious that is awesome i thought it wa just bluetooth
11579,no if your connected to wifi that your phone and watch are in then you can work your watch with all the function fine for example if i wa in my school i could leave my phone in my locker and go to gym class on the other side of the school and still get message and other thing a long a i connect my watch to the school wifi along with my phone
11580,thank you information technology q amp a show
11581,zaros3433k yes bluetooth must be enabled a it is the communication path between both device and yes the phone must be with you at all time in order for it to work with the exception of the time for example if you are phone is not with you or close by or the battery died the phone would still work but you will only see the clock

11794,this is how top 10 reason list video should start just instantly
11795,1 reason why i can not buy apple watch my budget
11796,yep already have an series 6
11797,kevin hart thank you
11798,if you hit the ground hard and it call 911 my question is who will talk to 911 for help
11799,ey they had this since 2015 where u been
11800,i absolutely love my watch i always use the find my feature that ding your phone i always loose it lol
11801,the 45mm is too big for your skinny wrist
11802,can one still receive notification text and use apple pay with gps version and no wifi
11803,bro do not let andrew tate watch this
11804,1 i do not have a mac 2 do not wear mask and my phone already unlocks easily with face id 3 yea that is kinda cool 4 how is that even considered a feature 5 do not care about health exercise 6 do not have smart light 7 sound like you care too much what other people think 8 se 2nd generation and series 7 8 are good
11805,before that i need to watch a video about 10 reason to buy iphone
11806,what is the apple watch band at 1 24 time stamp
11807,first video with a list that start right away great useful content a well thank you subscribed
11808,in my opinion the huawei watch gt3 pro is better a a smart watch since it ha 14 day of battery life and look a lot more high end than apple watch
11809,status symbol he say d you know whats a status symbol pulling up in a 300k lamborghini wearing a 150k luxury watch no one think a 400 usd watch is a status symbol bro
11810,you were online or inline they been had this where did you learn to speak
11811,what kind of wrist band is it
11812,w bro got straight to the point
11813,using apple pay on watch is not so simple you have to put a pas code on your watch to allow you to use apple pay it will not work unless you put in a passcode that is annoying because now everytime i put my wrist up i have to enter the code not so simple i have never used a pas code a the watch is never away from me
11814,in my country people just buy this for status simble because already iphone buying is wild chase
11815,in my country people just buy this for status simble because already iphone buying is wild chase
11816,i have had my watch for a couple day now and it almost completely replaced my phone i wish there wa a apple watch version of snapchat tho it is so useful at work and motivates me to move more and use the fitness feature all around great first watch and accessory
11817,the status symbol is a horrible take
11818,d no one need it it is all marketing you guy are doing
11819,one reason why you do not need apple watch is money
11820,3 02 yo boy floss
11821,i wa strongly considering getting one a few year ago but found out that none of the health feature were available in australia now that they are i treated myself to a gold stainless steel series 8 for both the health feature and a an accessory
11822,gold though but treat yourself
11823,bogdan ostojic depends on what you want it for
11824,do you think there is no need for the ultra one series 8 is enough
11825,the immediate thing that i noticed is that you move like a lot in the video which is disturbing otherwise good video
11826,the way he talk sound more like he just want to brag rather than actually prove point even if some of these are genuine feature just saying thing like wow taking out your phone take so much time this is seemless just prof how disappointing the 21st century is everyone doe not have time for anything i know this probably doe not make sense but like i hope someone doe
11827,10 reason you might want an apple watch is a more appropriate title
11828,these might be the worst reason to buy an apple watch except the workout fitness feature bro said that you need an apple watch because you can unlock your iphone with it
11829,all except the status symbol feature can be used with an android and a watch with wear o which is much cheaper
11830,apple
11831,apple watch being a status symbol lol what nice job building your personality around a piece of gadget that is outdated in one year and which is literally owned by million of people apple watch absolutely doe not elevate anyone is status quite the contrary nothing wrong with the product itself but it is not a status symbol
11832,no i do not
11833,this is all great and amazing but completely pointless if your watch is dead p i have an apple watch love the video man just wished these watch did not have horrible battery life
11834,well with the new watch o update you can turn on battery saving mode and it last over twice a long with no major setback other than the always on screen being turned off
11835,doe anyone know how to get the watch face in the thumbnail
11836,my first apple watch wa in 2015 i sold it because i thought it wa a waste just bought another one a week ago and now i am totally impressed it is a keeper
11837,i love how you just got to the point i wa hooked
11838,hideous looking watch in my view who would want that lump on your wrist
11839,should i get the se 1 or the series 7
11840,i got the se2
11841,no i do not need an apple watch because i have been a samsung user ever since
11842,great video very well done straight to the point i love it
11843,i just got mine returned it it is absolutely pointless i would rather wear a normal good looking watch
11844,people who are watching but can not afford
11845,this is completely useless
11846,first step give me money
11847,what is that orange band it is dope s s or alu or t which one and why

11851,omg thank you for starting immedeadly
11852,dude how small is your wrist the watch look wider than your wrist
11853,it pointless i sold mine it really is just inconvenience it so much easier to just pull out your phone
11854,what brand is the orange band you are wearing
11855,this is james bond level right here lol hell yeh bro
11856,when being chased by a crazy dog you can save yourself by throwing your apple pen or apple watch at him that will stop a wild dog in his track
11857,straight to the point but did not give me one good reason to get it completely lost me you said having an apple watch is a status simple
11858,thanks got to learn something
11859,doe it work with 2017 macbook air
11860,instant like for going straight to the point from star of the video
11861,i do not think it is cheesy at all that it save life that is the reasson i am gon na get one i always feel like somethings wrong with my heart but all the doctor never believe me and say everythings fine so i am gon na have to find out myself i am very scared about my heart all the time so i think wearing this will make me feel a bit safer
11862,please whoever see the comment can answer my question what is the color and what is the quality of the watch
11863,simplypops
11864,this is the apple watch series 7 45mm stainless steel in the color graphite
11865,i still think apple watch is gimmick
11866,so attacker got you with apple watch they have access to both iphone and mac what a feature
11867,simplypops so kidnapper just need one code to access everything on your device no thanks
11868,your apple watch will need to be unlocked with the passcode in order to unlock the mac and or iphone
11869,basically all of those reason where pointless it just an expensive fitness band
11870,straight to the point
11871,you do not need an apple watch
11872,how he started the video right away i can not even describe how genuinely happy it made me
11873,it ha crash detection now aswell
11874,i just do not like how you pay between 500 1000 on a watch that will be obsolete in a few year and i know phone go obsolete but phone have contract and can be upgraded within 2 year of a contract and it is not that easy with an apple watch and not all carrier offer a 2 year contract with an apple watch
11875,100 reason why you need to buy me a i do not have the money to afford
11876,what kind of pull ups were those
11877,got an apple watch 2 day ago and i work in a hospital it wa very useful a i can not have my phone all the time since i am dealing with patient i can see urgent message of my co worker thru my apple watch kinda helpful
11878,one reason is enough for me to not buy an apple watch and thats the price
11879,this man at 1 00 with his nj accent if i won open up credit comma
11880,i am just planning to buy an iwatch series 8 and i loved the camera feature it will help with vlogs and my thumbnail a i shoot alone for now
11881,i wish i had seen this much earlyer it took me 10 month to self decide if i want to get one or not and i did get one 2 week ago series 7 aluminiu green to match the green theme i went for airpods max green iphone 13 pro max alpine green and soon imac 2021 by start of year in 2023 or maybe december 2 year ago i owned iphone se2 and i wish i had the watch then the ability to unlock that annoying touch id wa a nightmare with face id i never had issue but damn for touch id in outdoors sucked i do think i will not enable the feature to unlock my watch iphone or imac with watch mainly for security reason aswell with applepay pretty much anyone can use those aslong a you have the watch on your hand and i sure do not trust ppl with my device acessability for it is awesome i must say for yt and it run smothly with synergy on iphone the display is watchable considering it 45mm size bright and loud aswell i still do not get workout and calorie but oh well i guess i need time to learn those thing you never get teached but self learn sometimes it reach double sometimes 5 to 6 time the goal and yet im not seeing a difference even though my diet is the same it just show me how active i am i guess one benefit of it is heath it show alot of data regarding it although i never enabled my acct on it it good to have in case i decide to i guess seeing weather data on it is great aswell shortly for me it ha 3 benefit synergy with iphone seeing data i need to check daily in no time spend to grab my iphone and tap to see and health info
11882,nice video but almost all of the feature showed in the video are on android device watch since year d

11900,it wa a banging as video except for the part where you kept saying the apple watch is a status symbol that is so damn corny and the goofiest thing that i have ever heard someone say specially about an apple product at that that is call being an apple die hard fan boy that wa a bit much if your obsessed with apple that much that you have bought more and more of the same watch but with just a different number in the name then i can understand why you think it is a status symbol but that is all personal preference and deff any factual info about being a status symbol
11901,this wa a very useful video for an about to be first time watch buyer also that is a nice wrist band you got
11902,great content without b
11903,apple is turning everyone into a nerd one nerdy accessory at a time with an apple watch apple glass etc revenge of the nerd i assume apple will eventually make apple pant which will be high water with a belt and suspender that will also tell you the weather apple is turning everyone into steve urkel
11904,reason number 1 buy a casio reason number 2 you do not need a watch you look for the time with your phone anyway and reason number 3
11905,you forgot to mention that you instantly get message and notification on the watch it is super useful when the phone is in the pocket and you simply glance at your watch to review your message
11906,trust and believe him he is god fearing person i never regret meeting him he unlock io device icloud activation lock iwatch unlock and ipad unlocks
11907,featureless number 1 disable the digital crown after a little dust or sweat render the whole watch unusable when will they ever make a watch without that worthless digital crown never

11972,i do not get why somebody should spend 700dollar on a smartwatch that ha no special feature like e g garmins do crazy battery life ecg and generally being best fitness tracker i got a smartwatch fossil gen 5 on ebay for like 60dollar and it also feature nfc payment bluetooth unlock and even more like a full web browser or google note perfect for cheating on exam and is even supported on apple device i get why people pay a premium for a collectible watch that hold it value but a 600dollar markup just for the apple logo really is not justified at all in my eye
11973,garmin is still better tho i love my iphone 13 pro max but in term of watch aw is just little phone extension that you need to charge constantly

11994,this list is mostly b it either feature that u only need for apple product or feature other watch have but for much more
11995,status symbol sound kinda arogant
11996,status symbol a 400 dollar fitness tracker a a status symbol am i missing something here i genuinely feel like maybe i misunderstood what you mean by status symbol afaik when people talking about a watch a status symbol we are talking about rolex iwc ap pp or at least an omega i do not think an apple watch are belong to that list by any stretch of imagination you can get it for 400 buck it lifespan are short and you can not do anything about it the thing is basically disposable i am not hating on apple watch i came here because i am interested to buy one in the first place but that status symbol nonsense kinda rub me in the wrong way
11997,thank you for not starting with a 10 minute intro a a wireless salesperson this video wa helpful
11998,ai not it crazy apple know your facial structure fingerprint card info heart rate blood 02 height weight age i still do not care tho face id dope asf
11999,i like some of the feature my only thing is it look atrocious i could never wear this a a daily watch instead of a real one
12000,what is the background called for your ultrawide monitor
12001,that is a screensaver on the mac
12002,apple watch a a status symbol
12003,what suck and the point of watch is to have a nice watch face thats nice looking apple make you choose between a handful of boring watch face it stupid and i just switched back to samsung because of it featutes do not matter if you have to choose between mickey fkng mouse and toy story it fkng annoying who care about unlocks and shit if it stupid childish
12004,status symbol this guy care so much what people think about him
12005,people are actually scared of hacker to use such payment feature
12006,how do i get that wallpaper
12007,if i have to watch a video to convice me that i need an apple watch i do not need an apple watch simple
12008,idk i am one of the biggest apple fan boy but the watch just doe not seem very useful to me except for running but i do not run
12009,good video thanks what model watch are you using exactly
12010,also do not forget the leather band and hermes my man
12011,a status symbol come on man everyone ha an apple watch i see them everywhere a rolex patek or ap are status symbol watch
12012,or get an cheaper huawei smartwatch or a mi band lol same thing
12013,what size is your watch 45mm
12014,conclusion i do not need an apple watch
12015,thanks for helping me know that i do not need one
12016,what watch face 3 19
12017,just got a series 7 and i freaking love it last one i had wa a series 4 when it first came out
12018,never used an apple watched and after watching this i have noticed it is a fucking useless waste of money i have got a credit card and i enjoy using my password to unlock my imac
12019,they been had this naw saying imma finna cop that watch
12020,how quaint except for fall detection coming out later 2022 for wearos i see nothing special or new about these feature you might a well had done a video about all smartwatches google wallet came out 3 year before apple pay and i read using it then it showed up on watch with nfc like my old square sony smartwatch 3 in 2014 you can not even watch youtube or control your entire house and broadcast over ask speaker like you can with google assistant on an apple watch status symbol no see a status symbol is a designer like the one you get from wear o like louis vuitton offering a few version of the tambour horizon armani tag heuer movado kate spade fossil i am amused by isheep user they get so happy when they finally get something everyone else ha had for year like did not you just get a keyboard on the apple watch with swype finally back then i do not even know because if it wa that hunt and peck your letter one by one stuff i would go mad y all are so cute bless your catching up heart
12021,to be honest i wa not really interested with this at first i think this help me out of my dad is choice of planning to buy this for u i do not use often watch or not use anymore but this a big deal
12022,do you wear the 45mm watch it is really big on your wrist
12023,i just worry on how much your apple watch can control because it possible that the watch can be robbed and the criminal will have power over you
12024,i love how it started a soon a i clicked on the video instead of wasting my time
12025,best youtuber ever he get right into it
12026,oh no pressing a four button is so annoying
12027,it is always interesting seeing how human can be so attracted to simplicity and spending whatever it take to do so the fact you said it take time and it is annoying to type in a passcode for when you are paying is sad remember when everything wa paid in cash or the swipe of a card and not inserting it but absolutely count me in lol i have got a series 7 45mm in stainless so i am definitely not one to say anything against all of you cheer and may apple continue to flourish for consumer like all of u
12028,thanks you put me off buying one saved me some money
12029,u older guy call it dick tracy level
12030,yo are we not going to talk about why he ha 1 227 90dollar

12032,getting to the point right away you gained a new subscriber
12033,it might be a stupid question but i am asking bcuz i do not know if your aw is stolen will the thief be able to use your apple pay
12034,we broke god law 2000 year ago god provided a savior jesus christ who suffered and took our punishment on the cross the bible say if we declare with out mouth jesus is lord and believe in our heart god raised him from the dead you shall be saved roman 10 9 god will forgive your sin and grant you everlasting life all because of what jesus did on the cross
12035,amen
12036,maybe save ur life but before it they kill some kid xd
12037,i still think apple watch and smartwatches in general do not have much a utility in regular life
12038,1 reason i do not have money
12039,i got it it is wonderful wacth apple is the new revolution i like
12040,this guy didnt play around bang instantly the video start

12043,how did you control ur ps5 with the gesture at 5 40
12044,status symbol is the dumbest reason
12045,thats far away from a status symbol maybe in some high school shit but a 5k normal watch is far more a status symbol not to talk about 10k
12046,status symbol lol

12062,my partner just gifted me series 7 45mm starlight watch a a gift i kinda want to return it but do not want to hurt her feeling it just cost so much and i personally think it is not worth it i mean yeah to track my fitness is good but meh
12063,i do not have iphone nor i am willing to buy apple watch but still i watched the video beacuse it wa straight to the point no nonsense talking
12064,apple watch is a status symbol holy god
12065,do u use cellular version or non cellular one
12066,i use mine because i am in a wheelchair and sometimes getting the phone out of my pocket is a pain and i use it for those reason
12067,you should do the se review if you can i can not wait for an se 2 honestly
12068,your watch is to wide for your wrist dude

12074,simplypops
12075,wow link to the watch wallpaper please the one on the thumbnail
12076,where did you buy your phone case
12077,instead of apple watch watch that you are eating your apple
12078,it can unlock something it will get u compliment it tell you cover your ear it is too loud because your ear can not tell you if something is too loud and most important it is a status symbol
12079,any of this do not show status symbol sorry i feel that even if you do not have these what matter most is how much you got in your bank
12080,i love that quote this is an apple watch you already know what time it is
12081,i disliked just because of the status symbol this is not right and really materialistic
12082,what size apple watch is this
12083,subscribed and linked just because no intro
12084,nope do not need it really it is frustrating to have the same watch a anyone else everything is becoming the same car watch you get the point we are different and that is the way we always we will be and that is a nice thing
12085,just do not wear a mask
12086,so you are basically saying that it is great to have an apple watch but you did not say you need a iphone and macbook to have at least 5 reason covered
12087,wait you can control the ps5 with it that is crazy
12088,doe only the apple watch 7 ha these feature or also other model
12089,tank you for learning me this
12090,one reason you can not use apple watch money
12091,who stole our apple watch it mean we fck up and have to charge every single day be lazy pay huge money extra charger cable pay more and more thank for info
12092,phone case amazon link
12093,apple watch is brilliant and the best smart watch out but why do you need cellular when are you ever without your phone
12094,how do you have your top widget start in the middle of your screen
12095,can i ask a question
12096,i would get one if they supported android phone oh well
12097,only people who have not experienced a real watch would go for a gimick such a the apple watch i would rather get a seiko for the same price and buy a cheap fitness tracker just my opinion
12098,status symbol rofl bro you need to work harder
12099,do we need to unlock iphone for using camera from watch
12100,just got mine yesterday and am loving it from nigeria
12101,one reason you do not need an apple watch you can not afford it
12102,i am waiting on the tesla phone
12103,just got my series 7 upgraded from my series4 love this watch
12104,the genius of apple convincing u we need thing we really do not over and over again
12105,yeah thats why samsung is better
12106,this is supposed to be anonymous i disagree with you rolex is one of the most expensive watch brand on the planet buying a brand new rolex mean that you are rich so it is not about the functionality and the application of the watch it self but on the contrary it is about stating your wealth to the society on top of that rolex and many other expsensive watch brand or even cheap one compared to these high value watch create time piece that are mechanical a watch mechanism which is very difficult and time consuming to construct
12107,this is supposed to be anonymous good point
12108,mdx the effect you state are not going to occur because of that tiny little watch lol people can remain smart and still have ease obviously you are still going to know how to unlock your macbook or know when you feel weird or know how to use an apple tv remote or keep a separate stopwatch for working out but it make those thing quicker to access and it cut down on all the seperate thing you need o2 device ecg device just a time telling watch etc in fact you are more spoiled by buying everything separate an apple watch is le expensive than a rolex and yet it can do a lot more but of course nobody really complains about rolex user
12109,nylotic convenience can become counter productive and in the end subtly capture u in it stupefying web if people spend their time seeking ease they will tend to become more unhealthy complacent isolated entrapped and unfulfilled
12110,hey man what app do you use to control nest with your watch i thought they removed the nest app for apple watch
12111,your iphone case is so cool can you shear the link of the website
12112,two day back got one self gift on my birthday
12113,thanks for this video it is helping me decide between apple and samsung btw your voice kept giving me kevin hart vibe
12114,thanks for explaining how useless apple watch is d d
12115,great watch with the worst ever battery life even a weekend outstation is impossible without the charger
12116,would you like to provide me some money to bye a apple watch
12117,one reason why i do not need apple watch i am indian
12118,thank a lot my first apple watch is s3 update to s5 i used for two year i get my new apple watch s7 yesterday
12119,good video but talk about first world problem that is not on you of course this totally a device of convenience
12120,only have 1 reason why i do not have a apple watch
12121,what is the iphone wallpaper you are using
12122,unlocked mine successfully he is fast and legit
12123,unlocked mine successfully he is fast and legit
12124,battery life on it suck though
12125,bro the series 7 look amazing def gon na upgrade from a 6 soon
12126,so i need apple watch for all those feature i can not use without other apple device too bad i do not have any apple device i only have itunes on pc and apple music on android
12127,in case your in an emergency that is one reason
12128,someone buy me one
12129,man you need a bigger wrist to wear that
12130,the unlock iphone feature is super insecure someone unlocked my iphone when it wa on the table and i wa near by
12131,i really want one for my birthday
12132,in my opinion the apple watch is no status symbol you can get an apple watch 4 or 5 for 150 200 and so almost everyone can afford it and it also no major upgrade over an series 5 or 6 same sh battery life the bigger screen is just a minor upgrade and the blood oxygen is really inaccurate the series 8 with the new design will be worth the upgrade
12133,no way you are praising a product that isnt even announced yet
12134,purchased yesterday
12135,we love a video that get right to the point absolutely subscribing just for that thank youuuu
12136,brooo when tf they had apple pay on the apple watch man i could have been pullin hoe with that
12137,status symbol ha here i am wearing my rolex watching this video
12138,one big reason that will cancel all this is you will have the to charge it everyday
12139,currently have the series 5 apple watch should i upgrade to the series 7 or should i just wait until later this year for apple to come out with the series 8
12140,wait tbh the 8 is gon na be loaded with new feature
12141,what case is that on your iphone
12142,2 01 when you fall down you will damage your apple watch and break the screen
12143,status symbol apple watch or iphones are too common to be status symbol wake up
12144,this is my first apple watch and im in looooove
12145,one reason i do not need an apple watch i hate apple and i am an android user please stop using these stupid title that is another reason making you look so so unprofessional
12146,what app did u use for the nest thermo
12147,you forget say about flash light function also so cool and usable
12148,bro got right into the video thats an alpha move
12149,oh no not the passcode
12150,i can not afford one lol
12151,good list but why is the status thing do important if u want to buy it for the status just do not jesus christ
12152,where can i get that wallpaper tho
12153,nice video but that large size apple watch look like an ipad mounted onto your wrist lol
12154,the number one reason i have never bought an apple watch is that i could not live with the fact you have to take it off and charge it every day
12155,1 000 000 reason to not buy them
12156,you mean a status symbol so people know you have got money the reason wa not good enough to sell the watch because most have been on for year
12157,why i can not use it with my android whyyyyy
12158,awesome video life is just easier with an apple watch
12159,i love too so
12160,wat colour is ur watch bro
12161,very informative video question what do you recommend in term of band
12162,i see bragging right a a good reason
12163,bro we can see your balance in the apple pay part
12164,i do not need it but i want it
12165,ten reason to be even more a slave really a status symbol homie a watch doe not define the person you are
12166,hey bro you sound like kevin hart
12167,right to the point subbed
12168,i turned off when i saw the baby rep half rep for the pull ups lol
12169,no need a it is already 2022
12170,what if my watch wa stolen
12171,awesome review love the accent the blood oxygen level detector is so good i am just recovering from coronavirus and they use that percentage all the time when evaluating your airway for example my oxygen level in the ambulance wa 88percent which is low i am now a healthy 95percent
12172,the best comment i liked wa yo they have this since 2015 where have you been hilarious
12173,just purchased last night aswell one to myself in the midnight color and one in product red to my fianc be both can not wait to get them
12174,no b intro straight business
12175,i will have mine in a few day ordered it two day ago i got the se 44mm right now this will be my first series watch can not wait to get the series 7 so excited
12176,not worth the money for me
12177,doe the series 6 work independently a well not having to workout or bike or run with a big phone is gold
12178,just revived one for xmas
12179,nice
12180,what is that background on the ultra wide at 5 28 look mint
12181,are these even real reason
12182,i am still enjoying my se just wished the apple watch had longer battery life
12183,i got an 12 pro max with the watch se i love my se
12184,that camera app is great for looking around a corner without being seen also i am kinda short so in a tight crowd could come in handy a a periscope can also keep an eye on a room that you are not in brilliant
12185,thats the coolest video well done but how did u control the playstation on apple watch
12186,1 56 they been had this since 2015 where you been lmao this nigga funny
12187,i always say everyone who ha an iphone and want a new one get yourself an apple watch and a pair of airpods it is amazing how they work together
12188,that guy bro samsung is shit there product are half baked
12189,pau vargas try samsung galaxy bud solid earphone that are intuitive with a more sleek design if you are not a flashy person
12190,wokesheep yeah they last at least a day if you use it regularly
12191,how is the battery on apple watch do they realistically last a complete day with heavy usage
12192,savixx in my opinion airpods are the most disappointing product at least for me i do not know about pro but i have 2nd gen they fall off all the time the sound quality is just normal and the people outside hear more than i do wearing them recently i got myself a pair of solo pro is and they are awesome headphone apple watch iphone the essential combo they work great together
12193,also there is no way to set up watch with ipad must have phone another reason i hate apple i bought the 7 cellular i do not the f n phone status symbol my adollardollar if you that hard up for outside affirmation wear apple shirt and get apple tattoo you will attract ppl just a goofy
12194,would you recommend the 7 over the se even with the price difference
12195,i know you didnt ask me but i would recommend the 7 because it can probably last you longer
12196,here is a good tip remove your fucking mask clown lmao it take so much time
12197,my wife had the series 1 her and i both just got the series 7 for christmas it is my first ever watch i bought hers for christmas and wa watching video about and had to get one myself
12198,til that oh they have that on the watch now is a compliment xd
12199,the status symbol got me pausing the video and getting the fuck out of here
12200,y go get urself some vip bruh
12201,need is not the right word for first world problem
12202,great info an review i had 2 series of apple watch and they are sitting dusty on my drawer im not planning to buy any until they fix the main thing battery life if they can make it to last for at least a week i would be really thrilled and reconsider otherwise all the improvement just said are not really exciting to me
12203,a week damnn bro do not get ur hope up
12204,status symbol hahahaha pleaseee
12205,where have you been
12206,how did you control apple tv with hand gesture
12207,okey so it just a fun gadget you do not really need
12208,when did apple release the ability to control a ps5 with the apple watch
12209,2022 do not buy any phone your watch is good enough
12210,nice
12211,just bought today yayy merry christmas everyone
12212,it just be tooo thick
12213,1 reason why you should not buy apple watch it too much money to waste
12214,i do not need reason i need money to buy it
12215,i like that band where can i get this band
12216,78 degree in the room damn bro
12217,these are reason why you do not need an apple watch unlock a laptop and iphone the heart rate and blood o2 is probably the best feature but some have criticised it a not on correct algorithm if you have an iphone you do not need it on your wrist also lot of thing are gimmick camera app is the best overall not worth the money iphone 13 pro however is great
12218,i love how you started instantly with the list very concise
12219,yeah i wa so confused because usually people rake 5 min to do a introduction
12220,like a true new yorker he is not here to waste our time
12221,tammo snell lol same
12222,i feel like a 30sec 1min intro is also acceptable
12223,instantly liked the video because of this
12224,the watch is too big for your little wrist bro
12225,great video mate greeting from belgium
12226,nice thanks
12227,liked right away when your video start right into the list without all the b
12228,haaaa fucking great review i am buying one brilliant
12229,if you are buying something because it give you status symbol sorry but you actually are dumb
12230,hello
12231,i really want a apple watch but i do not want a iphone
12232,for the price it a stupid investment for most of people
12233,it is stupid to think it is an investment in more or a convenience buy
12234,yep gon na get one after christmas maybe or before if it arrives before christmas
12235,coming from a 38mm series 2 is a huge difference now have a 45mm s7
12236,after watching this video i have decided to buy an apple watch so many feature
12237,the battery is the let down if only apple can make it last a week i will get one
12238,it is crazy how youtube remove the dislike count and i just be discovering these great tech youtubers definitely subscribing
12239,the ubrowser kick it to another level it basically add safari to your watch with the keyboard and cellular it is awesome
12240,make me realize getting one is so dumb
12241,what is the name of your watch is complication
12242,can you help me buy one sir i will pray for you certainly god bless
12243,i am still rocking my series 2 apple watch and it is still good for most of these task such a unlocking a macbook paying with credit card fitness tracking messaging controlling the iphone camera and others since it is not updating the o anymore apple dropped the series 2 support it is lacking the iphone unlocking and you can not add a covid 19 certificate in the watch after 4 year of service the battery life is like new i already bought a series 7 but have not opened it yet will wait till christmas i will miss my series 2 though because i do not mind bumping it occasionally in stuff which happens
12244,p sh power to you i had bashed it a couple of time and wa surprised how sturdy it wa but did not want to push my luck
12245,imaad malik no i would not put cover on any watch apple watch is pretty sturdy but mine ha mark from the spark when cutting metal with a flex so wearing it then wa a bad idea
12246,get yourself a nice plastic cover i bought a tpu style one for my se it not a obtrusive or noticable a i thought it would be
12247,i would much rather a traditional automatic watch
12248,so someone take apple watch they can buy anything
12249,lol like the flossy carter notification white shoe calm down
12250,there is no chance that in 2021 or 2022 or any year anyone need a smartwatch that ha close to 1 day battery life le when you have smartwatches with more sensor and 21 day battery sapphire ceramic titanium
12251,rare chang i same here fitbit 5 day garmin 10 day huawei 15 day and so on right now a fitbit sense doe the trick people that did not have a 1 2 week battery smartwatch can not understand i wa a watch lover before smartwatches maybe that is why
12252,that is the only one reason why i have not got an apple watch the battery
12253,what size is that watch it is huge it a mimi ipad
12254,45mm 1 9 display
12255,i have the aw6 13 month now i no longer use my samsung watch

12267,is yours 45mm thanks

12281,this review is stupid
12282,jake simms only poor people try to flex with apple product i bet you own a used iphone 6 who you bought for 200dollar
12283,jake simms you either are an indian or a 7 year old only a poor man flex with an apple watch it cost like 300dollar
12284,jake simms i have canon r5 paired with 50mm 1 4 this camera and lense cost more than iphone 13 pro max apple watch and macbook pro all combined
12285,feroooo71 not having an apple watch seem quite salty for no reason
12286,jake simms of what
12287,my man your wrist is too skinny and thin you need a smaller watch this look like you have a smartphone wrapped on your wrist lamo
12288,just order the 45mm series 7 from a series 3 42mm super excited for it to get here
12289,just order the 45mm series 7 from a series 3 42mm super excited for it to get here
12290,just purchased this a a christmas gift for my wife she ha the iphone 12 she got last summer and even though she made a comment about why would anyone want or need this type of watch if you have the iphone i still thought it wa a good idea she is not great with learning these device so hope it is easy to figure out she is a nurse and probably would come in handy at her job also i got the cellular version in case she wanted to add it to our plan i am still a little apprehensive about the purchase because i do not know if she will like it another reason i got it is because she ha sleep apnea and refuse to be officially tested her oxygen level often go below 90 so i hope she will wear this at night to get some type of idea
12291,i enjoyed the intro you did not talk about what you were going to talk about you just did it well done
12292,i still got my series 2 nike edition
12293,what size is it the watch is a big a your wrist no offense i have small wrist and i do not like the look of it feel sooo bulky great review

12296,measure your wrist 130mm 200mm 41mm watch 140 220mm 45mm
12297,i like that band
12298,i just loved seeing flossycarter in your notification after seeing your comment on his video literally this morning
12299,good video but sorry when you started talking about the watch being a status symbol i unsubscribed sorry not interested in hearing this
12300,life with johnny he is not even cry bro all he is saying is that some people use it to look cool

12306,bro your room setup look amazing can you pls do a room tour
12307,you have to be incredibly stupid to be wearing a mask while you are all by yourself how brainwashed can you be
12308,i am surprised that orange and purple band look so good on the black watch case
12309,status symbol rly
12310,just got mine a week ago and i am crazy in love somehow make me wana walk or run around more with that step apps
12311,iwatch 7 watch that always tell the time
12312,do you wear your watch to bed you just take it off and charge it all night the charge last all day with some left over
12313,great review waiting for my 7 to arrive thanks now after watching your review i want an apple tv
12314,waiting for the day that we can check our bac level would save so many life if we can simply check on our wrist how much under over the limit we are
12315,if such an advanced watch can not last for up to 15days with a single charge so what is the damn need to own one
12316,good review why are you wearing a mask sitting in a room by yourself what are you afraid of you may know about apple product but you are a government go along liberal fool
12317,i am going to buy the se for my girlfriend for xmas do i need to get the add on verizon hookup i wa just going to buy the gps to keep the cost down your thought she ha a apple 12 phone thank you joe
12318,may i know which watch face you are using look kinda cool
12319,brih imagine just buying it bc it unlocks your mac quando iphone faster
12320,i just ordered the nike series 7 but claiming one of the best thing of the watch is that it is a status symbol cmon man do not be that guy
12321,where did you get you band from
12322,wait wa he controlling his ps5 with the apple watch that is nut
12323,wa loving my series 3 stainless steel apple watch but felt like the price tag stopped me from upgrading for example i did not wan na upgrade to a s5 because i dumped almost dollar800 into the s3 stainless steel this year i made the difficult decision to go down to the aluminum s7 thinking that i will upgrade two year from now and the smaller price tag make an upgrade justifiable and the resale value is a little higher
12324,harvz b only the stainless steel ha this scratch resistant screen for some reason it is overpriced but it if your worried about getting scratch stainless steel is the only way i do not know why it is not an option on aluminium model
12325,i wanted to get the s s7 for dollar630 great deal but stuck with the non cellular aluminum and bought a nice band band have more use than the watch since i can potentially use it for all future apple watch e
12326,ye stainless steel is nice and all but that price for it is too high
12327,now you are thinking what do you use the stainless steel for anyway
12328,i am thinking of ordering one this will be my second one but the one i have now is a broken series 2
12329,amazing watch but there is always a but with apple the battery ohhh godddd the battery it is a kill thing
12330,simple watch is better thand apple watch we have to charge apple watch every day it bit aanoying sipmle anolog watch is far better than apple watch
12331,the apple watch look huge
12332,had my 4 since 2019 love it getting a 7 today 20 november can not wait
12333,what is the size that you are wearing
12334,the way you control tv look like straight out of sci fi movie
12335,nice video thanks do you mind sharing that wallpaper
12336,bruh where did you get that orange band you have look amazing
12337,i know it could not take my eye off that band
12338,changing volume or song chapter om podcasts or spotify from my watch while showering or away from iphone is gold a well a the applepay hold close bam paid is nice
12339,nice overview you missed one big feature on the camera app when activated from the whatch it seems to activate the wide screen lens om your iphone with the scroll wheel you can zoom the cam and the better cam quality is with the middle lens also the sound will zoom in and out with the lens change and be more detailed when you zoom to middle main objective on the iphone i am still very happy with my s5 but need bigger screen and better battery soon and awaiting new design with s8 d
12340,love your stuff just finding you
12341,apple should employ you this wa super helpful and i have watched a lot of video and yours had new information thanks so much i have got a first gen so i am definitely in need of an upgrade lol
12342,please anything but a status symbol if you are talking about status symbol via a watch we are talking a completely different lineup of brand
12343,well i switched from apple watch 1st gen to rolex datejust then now back to apple watch series 7 so it might be but actually let me explain 1st gen apple watch had limited capability and i wa overwhelmed with charging a watch back then having to charge my phone ipad macbook keyboard mouse and what not plus i am really into the original watch that show time so i wa wearing rolex for last 6 year then i started working out a little bit more and being into workout i got myself apple watch s7 which doe a lot of thing nowdays compared to the 1st gen so i am wearing s7 a my daily now
12344,patek philippe and a lange amp sohne are the ultimate status symbol of the watch world
12345,after waiting 3 year i will wait another one for the 8
12346,hi mate great content i wan na know what size are you wearing and what is your wrist size

12351,1 54 exactly xd
12352,yes i am about that titanium life
12353,i am working on a comparison comparing all the apple watch material
12354,bought my first ever apple watch series 7 45mm used for over a week and returned back to apple and not that impressed i think it is too expensive for what i use it for mainly use for notification apple pay check time sleep tracker and step battery is very disappointing i never use the new health feature i might get the se if i see on sale
12355,denislav dimov why would not you have the charger charge it right after dinner every couple of day and you have 0 issue
12356,that is crazy mine ha never died on me maybe not fuck your apple watch lmao
12357,all that feature and if you do not have the charger after about 20 24 hour of usage you just have a few hundred on your wrist if they do not improve battery life nothing else matter
12358,wow im suprised because my old series 2 go through the whole day and i still have battery left so idk
12359,um i forgot i could apple pay with my watch i have been entering my pin code on my iphone like a fool thank you
12360,status symbol you know they have an iphone you know they have imessage you know they have facetime
12361,my apple watch series 7 45mm stainless gold arrived yesterday 12 012 21 and wanted to thank you for this vlog it help a lot and i have a apple series 5 hermes 44m stainless steel that will now be my dress watch
12362,i never knew i could control my nest thermostat with my watch thank you very much
12363,my man how
12364,bruh i think you should get the 41 mm this is wayyyyy too big for your wrist
12365,the apple watch is impressively huge in your wrist it is ridiculous and no we do not need an apple watch byyyyyyye
12366,good list i literally use apple pay every day on the apple watch it is one of the best feature and even work without a phone nearby i also have the steel version and really like the sapphire display since it resists scratch so much better than non sapphire i activated cellular and now leave my phone behind quite a bit one note about the series 7 the faster charging is a real plus i now charge before bed and use it for sleep tracking which is something i did not do with prior version since it took too long to charge nice video btw subscribed
12367,a long a the retailer support nfc payment apple pay should work
12368,soon yes that make it easy to use
12369,can you use it on apple watch for apple pay with out putting in passcode bc it is annoying
12370,ian upstate ny i use it a lot i usually ask if the retailer support apple pay and many place have a sign on the door it is pretty common
12371,where do you live that there is apple pay everywhere
12372,oh you will need to charge your phone it is always low battery
12373,i will get one if you buy it for me
12374,didnt know about unlocking my macbook with the apple watch awesome
12375,maybe you shoul get a smaller watch the 45 is too big for your wrist
12376,gesture control at 5 39 how did you do that is part of the app
12377,i think it is called magico a third party app currently in closed beta
12378,yes he is really good at this
12379,this ha helped me make a decision thank you for a perfectly crafted guidance
12380,man ha the most connected house on this world
12381,i do not need any of those feature
12382,i got the series 6 in 44mm and just got the 7 41mm i like to call n speak on my watch the series 7 watch speaker is rubbish compare to the 6
12383,it is a watch if you can buy an s7 you should at least have some wireless airpods
12384,a status symbol
12385,i never knew u could hand free control apple tv wit the watch i may have to get apple tv i hate waking up looking for the remote
12386,nice keep the vids coming shout out flossy carter gigidy
12387,i like the apple watch very much but for me it feel like a prison of receiving en having yo respond to message ore checking apps wasting time
12388,what is your wrist size
12389,is no body gon na talk about how the watch is oversized on his wrist
12390,jonathan r saw ton of the watch look huge on your wrist what is wrong with these people wear wtf you want
12391,jonathan r cope
12392,people like you who care it is not yours
12393,is this cellular version
12394,apple is first generation product tend to lack many crucial feature and the watch wa no exception i would say that starting with the gen 5 watch thing were finally at a tolerable level any watch before that wa great for enthusiast and apple fan but unacceptable for most normal people out there this also applies to software like io now that apple ha been adding feature to it for more than ten year it is finally becoming and acceptable substitute for android that is just the way apple work these day
12395,punaiset pimpulat i can not debate with an apple hater in 2022 thats very old
12396,mata toto you sound like the kind of person who like debate
12397,punaiset pimpulat what the heck are you talking about by the time apple released the iphone 1 they patented the multi gesture touchscreen it pretty much revolutionized the industry of touchscreen with a device that wa pretty much decade away from what wa currently on the market yeah sure it did not have 3g or mm capability at least without jailbreaking it which wa very common back then on iphones but still it wa like year ahead of the competition you brought the worst example to prove your delirium lol if you are going to reply please do it with a tiny bit of sanity at least
12398,mata toto i have noticed that it is a very apple thing to do to release an amazing product that catch everyone is attention however upon critical view you will notice that in many regard it is still an inferior product compared everything else that is on the market one of the best example of this strategy is the iphone 1 it ha not 3g while everyone else already had it at the time it can not sent mm message while everyone at the time had been doing that for year already however it did have a capacitive touch display in a time period when everyone wa stuck using inferior resistive touch display or simply not even having a touch display of any kind the development of the io is also full of example like this and that is why for many many year it wa entirely valid to call it a crippled o compared to android nowadays apple ha finally caught up with a lot of that technical debt but it is still pretty sad how many absolutely crucial basic feature came several year late
12399,apple invented everything dunno what your talking about the first gen apple watch is mile ahead of the latest and greatest android smart watch
12400,my dude i think a 41mm would look better on you

12660,king supreme the fake one is not better there are some decent fake but they are 100percent not better and usually are either shittier quality or missing some feature or do not sound work a well believe me i have tested them stop being an anti apple boy for the sake of it
12661,king supreme he side with the consumer at the end of the video about removing charger try to watch the full video next time
12662,demeter nah even if the fake one is better he will always defend real one is pricing there is literally a cheap apple airpod max that work almost same a original and this man will still defend the pricing of original he also defended apple when they get rid of charger if i remember it correctly
12663,you need more complex education
12664,i mean he is comparing a fake v a real apple product what other verdict did you expect you do not have to be a fanboy to come to that conclusion
12665,yoooo
12666,now even any noise smartwatch can do all thing than an apple one only difference is the half cut apple
12667,can you do this with ipad too
12668,you need to check noise fireboat clone
12669,damn u must be heck of a guy for wanting to buy clone for even noise and fireboat like cmon man they just cost around 50 100 dollar range
12670,expensive is better
12671,you can try noise alpha 4 watch
12672,probably made in the same sweatshop
12673,congrats for the engagement i hope and pray that you and drisha have a great life together
12674,arun miah congrats on the engagement and i hope you have a wonderful future together

12723,dishant seth the dollar30 is made from recycled plastic hence environmentally friendly
12724,dishant seth it got smaller packaging xd while both of them are paper dollar30 one have smaller packaging so dollar30 is more environmental friendly

12747,can you please send me iphone 14 pro max and smart watch ultra ind
12748,fitbit ha entered the chat
12749,it is better than apple
12750,257th comment congrats on the engagement btw
12751,i mean heck for dollar30 i will take it
12752,i have a 80euros android watch and it ha all the feature of the apple watch and it is measurement are precise
12753,yooo sick
12754,why do not they just make a nice looking watch that dose notification it all most people use anyway loose all the fitness stuff most people do not want there watch telling them they do not go to the gym and them that do know what they have done loose the sleep tracking thats when it on charge loose the apps 90percent are pointless anyway make it look like a watch with the added bonus you can put them cotton strap that loop through the pin hey you might get decent battery life aswell somtimes le is more and simple is the beutifull
12755,dishant seth yehh but if you use the sleep tacker do you then take your charger to work and charge your watch doing without it for half the morning plus do you need a watch to tell you youve had a good or bad sleep is it just a gimick then what app do you actually use maybe apple pay camera remote all the other one the phone is more practical no ie if somone had a race with you using your watch and them pulling there phone out there pocket who get it done quicker the whole point of the watch is it easyer siri would bring it back a bit though but then if this simplistic watch wa 30 quid it would have a market will it take market share from apple not really
12756,plenty of watch that do what you want apple watch have an entirely different market i could maybe do away with some of the more niche fitness stuff but no way am i losing something a basic a sleep tracking or the entire app store lol i do not think you have actually used any apps on that some of them are super useful
12757,i have the cheap watch and it is really good for the price
12758,hk9 pro aron that is the one to compare amoled screen same menu same strap perfect working screen it is just 40 dollar
12759,not syarip i do not know who you are but someone like you probably should not be wasting time on yt short lmao
12760,dishant seth 120 thats my phone price
12761,not syarip yeah well you can save up and get a skagen gen 6 for dollar120 or an aw series 5 for dollar150 and they would both be an immensely better value than this random no name watch lol
12762,dishant sethyeah it sayz 40 dollar not 300 what u can expect
12763,the software probably suck though no 3ed party apps notification reply or any actual smart feature i would imagine
12764,that 30 dollar is goid vro 10dollar 800rs 30dollar 2400rs wait what i would buy this in 1000 easily galli ki dukan hai
12765,daddy
12766,there so good copy u can not even tell
12767,bro dollar30 is not cheap
12768,i would buy the dollar30 watch
12769,since you have so many phone which one do you use
12770,nice
12771,the dollar30 one is real magic it can measure the heart rate of a potato
12772,lmao
12773,30 dollar for a close apple watch is a absolute steal
12774,i do not think that this wa a fair comparison if you look in the right place you can find much better apple watch copy
12775,bro the comment said 0 and i thought it wa really 0
12776,that 3dollar is the firebolt watch
12777,huawei band 7 ha entered the chat
12778,i will go with the 30 dollar one
12779,bro will find pro in anything
12780,good job man
12781,i prefer the 1995 apple watch
12782,all this time it is not about the watch it is about the status symbol that is why a 30 dollar recplica exists
12783,catboy samsung people do not randomly crash and they do not get helplessly lost those are problem only apple people have but when you need to find your way home you pull up google map
12784,catboy i do not know what year your se apple junk is from but i am guessing it is 10 year old or something that mean apple ha slowed the processor at least 10 different time so far so i would be surprised if it even can handle turning itself on at this point apple is newest iphone 14 x pro ultra maxx infinity s super pro with the latest iupgrade can not even come close to competing with the big daddy s23u let alone you mention a phone from 10 year ago and you paid dollar400 for a phone from 10 year ago that doe not even turn on that is an expensive paperweight considering apple basically give their newest phone away for free apple people are so dumb that it embarrasses me and the one that actually try to argue that grossly overpriced mediocre apple ijunk is the best is just disgustingly hilarious you million of idiot have the identical phone yet you think it is the best in the world simply because it is the only option you people can buy since you sold your soul to apple
12785,catboy anyways i believe se2 is not good both s23 ultra and 14 pro max are very good option your choice depends on the operating system same go for apple watch and watch 5 pro similarly priced here and for what o you prefer
12786,catboy lol none of those basic smartwatch feature matter to apple people that is the whole point a long a it look like an apple watch that is all that matter to apple people a dollar30 version is simply a cheap way to sneak into the club personally i would not be caught dead in that club
12787,catboy are you joking i use the samsung watch 5 pro aka the best smartwatch on the market
12788,the other watch wa a firebolt one no wonder it not similar to apple
12789,that is actually worth 30dollar
12790,oh yeah im earlyyy

12967,how much for cellular service with verizon
12968,i do not know
12969,i like apple 8 watch
12970,it is great
12971,i am looking to purchase my very first apple watch i have been a member of the fitbit community for year but i would like to try something different i have family member who have the se and 6 i am looking at 8 i have no idea smh
12972,i wanted the ultra but it felt like i had an iphone strapped to my little wrist lol
12973,i can see that being the case it is a big watch
12974,if all tech video were this clear and well thought out and actually considered the question most people have about this stuff the youtube tech community would be a better place you have earned a subscriber
12975,thank you very much have a great day
12976,craig is tech talk you got it bud i wish you ton of success and thanks for the awesome and very helpful content
12977,thank you very much that is so kind of you to say i appreciate you subscribing and sticking around to see more thank you again for the nice comment
12978,just purchased a 45mm series 8 in graphite stainless steel it is my first apple watch and i liked the idea of the increased durability also best buy had them on sale for dollar70 off i have primarily used fitbits and i always ding up the aluminum body that coupled with the continuous reduction of feature or putting them behind a paywall finally made me move on i am pretty excited for when it get here
12979,i feel like the most important part for the newer watch is the fast charging put it on the charger after dinner while watching show or doing dish and get it to 100percent in no time flat that way you can wear it to bed and all day the next day and it becomes more like a non 1 day battery plus sleep tracking that is the reason i will not get an se model
12980,the 8 is what i am getting the middle step child 800 is crazy money but the 8 now is dollar380 i wish they had blue and gold 45 mm but they do not so i got the black i can not get the 7 i want latest and greatest not the older version fomo is real
12981,series 8 for my birthday in march 5 23
12982,thinking of getting the se because of the price and cellular omg in australia it is dollar479 now so great price
12983,that is expensive the se is a great watch you do not sacrifice performance with any of their watch i hope you enjoy it
12984,ultra great watch for hairdresser can not see why anyone else would be interested marketed a a great yuppie outdoor watch there are much better dedicated one out there same go for a a sport watch which serious athlete would actually wear that good battery life for the size of a brick and cellular too many hidden cost most people who would go for that would be to old to understand or use half the feature anyway like the actual look and design but still way too big
12985,thanks for the review i like how you speak a a consumer to the consumer i find that pretty cool since a lot of reviewer wanting to strike that balance somehow do not pull it off a well a for the watch i picked up the s8 45mm midnight unfortunately it still ha not arrived i hope a a non apple watch user i am going to dig it i have the first gen galaxy watch which i enjoyed but it is time to lay to rest because well apple ecosystem i like a big interface with bell and whistle however i will not bite on the ultra it is simply unnecessary for my need also i am trying to get out of the vicious cycle in tech of owning the latest and the greatest which frankly is a bottomless pit too many consumer i wa one of them fall prey to
12986,i have never had an apple watch but i am considering one to replace my out of date fitbit which one though i am still not sure
12987,series 8 is my first apple watch my electrophysiologist fancy cardiologist at cleveland clinic wanted me to get one to monitor my heart with the ekg feature and other health feature the se wa a no go since it doe not have that feature the ultra wa a strong possibility for the added battery the brighter and bigger screen for a senior the siren for safety and of course the cool factor yes it ha a gazillion feature for pro athlete that i will never use but i am guessing just about any apple watch ha feature that some use and others do not those that think it is too big for everyday use well that is just a personal preference the only reason i did not go for it is that i am a stomach and side sleeper and it would not work well having it on my arm at night and the sleep monitoring feature is a big plus for me the 8 is a bit cumbersome at night sometimes but manageable
12988,i have a old apple each it is old nike apple watch
12989,imo ultra is the best deal with the extra feature i have got a series 7 and no gon na upgrade but it a nice watch
12990,ehm i do not know where these price coming from but the watch are definitely much higher in price so cost the series 8 41mm gps from 498 and the 45mm gps is from 538
12991,do not know where you are but series 8 gps is dollar399 for 41mm and dollar429 for 45mm i visited the apple store for price i do not know where you found those odd price i can visit apple com for my pricing information
12992,4 none
12993,is it just me or do you look like jim carrey and elon musk at the same time
12994,doe anyone know how knowing about blood oxygen percentage is actually useful
12995,18 hour battery seriously
12996,i have very small wrist for a female the ultra look way too big on me so i bought the s gold 8
12997,sorry it wa too big for you it is a big watch the good thing is the 8 is a great watch i hope you enjoy your new watch thanks for watching
12998,i upgraded from a series 3 to an 8 i have had it for a week and it is a serious upgrade the swim activity health sleep tracking is worth it to me
12999,very cool that is huge step up glad to hear you are enjoying it
13000,great video i learned a lot
13001,thank you john that is great to hear i appreciate you watching
13002,i do not know but our ancestor were living without such watch and they are more healthier
13003,hy zone plenty of people 2k year ago people lived to 35 if they were lucky in 1960s that number wa closer to 52
13004,dan c who lived more than 90yrs now a day
13005,hy zone literally fact not opinion lol life span is longer than it is ever been
13006,dan c then you are wrong buddy research
13007,our ancestor life span wa much shorter than u
13008,the 8 series is my first apple smartwatch and it sure is something to like the health stats the quality of the display microphone and ease of use and integration with the apple ecosystem probably have no competition at the moment
13009,worst mistake of my life buying one of these the battery is crap their watch spend more time of the charger than on the wrist
13010,great watch and surely lot of buzz over the ultra however reading through comment make me think when did a watch become something you swap for a new one every 2 to max 3 year oh boy
13011,all 3 are wrong there saved you time
13012,i miss steve job where he kept thing simple with naming convention and product offer where there are not too many option for purchaser thanks for this video it wa very helpful
13013,you are welcome and thank you for watching it it doe get a little silly at time
13014,shopping today so thanks for information on this video super helpful question i can not tell what color starlight is it look like silver with gold rose is this correct
13015,so sorry for the late response my wife described it a a champagne definitely not gold rose or silver if anything it would be a slight gold mixed with silver i think tan ish silver
13016,apple just clearly have feature that make no sense hiking really nooo
13017,thanks for the thoughtful analysis i am an iphone user of many year currently 11 but have never had a smart watch i am now retired and want to buy my first i think your tip about the se may work for me a my initial foray into smart watch i am really looking for the fitness and music feature to start if i use and enjoy the se i will upgrade in a year or 2 and one of my kid will be gifted the se any comment on my plan are welcome thanjs
13018,i have the apple watch series 7 45mm midnight gps cellular i do not need to upgrade to the series 8
13019,definitely getting one with cellular can not wait to ditch my phone just grab my ipod and go for a walk do not even need pocket
13020,i bought the se2 really good watch
13021,coming from andriod i am getting the iphone 13 128gb midnight with a yellow magsafe case and the apple watch se 2gen starlight nike sport loom band black white with the air pod pro 2nd generation
13022,i am going to take your advice and get the se a this will be my first venture into the smart watch world your advice wa well reasoned and compelling enough to sway me to the se thanks
13023,that is pretty cool watch every beeen sepowerfull smartwatch apple iphone thank you
13024,watchos 9
13025,will the lower power mode update unable more battery time on the series 7 watch
13026,love your channel i am still torn between the series 8 stainless steel in graphite 45mm with milanese loop which is the same price a the watch ultra i feel like i do not think the watch ultra will look a nice with my more dressed up band than the stainless graphite i would get aluminum but they do not offer space grey anymore and i prefer more subtle color not the crayon color like the red and midnight or green and silver so i am stuck with stainless steel graphite or space black which is a staggering 1450 hermes edition only color which suck for me
13027,craig is tech talk no problem and thank you for the time and response apple should have more band option but those apple branded dress brand will probably cost a fortune just look at the basic band the are charging 100 usd for i could only imagine a titanium or stainless steel band cost thank goodness for the like of third party company assisting u normal people with lower price maker like spigen rhino shield caduabe and others are really nice a well i hope next year they make make all the series 9 with a flat display like in the render and maybe a 46mm ultra for people with smaller wrist and more color option
13028,thank you very much kai i can understand what you are saying the graphite stainless steal is nice and you have so many way to dress it up i am surprised apple doe not have a really nice dress band for the ultra i am sure those will come thanks for watching
13029,thank you craig this is the best apple review i have seen yet i actually watched it twice i struggle with the ultra using the measure band i am in between 2 3 size tried it on at apple store wow i felt like a shark wa sitting on my wrist weird analogy but true just the size and the weight had me eliminate it a a real contender still going back forth with series 8 and se and series 7 too you mentioned io 9 specifically additional sleep monitor feature do all 3 of the above mentioned have same feature lastly this might be a stupid question so pardon a new version of io for watch are released doe the watch have ability to automatically update like phone ipad looking forward to other video and i will look for the join button now thx suze
13030,thank you very much that is so nice of you to say my apology for the delayed response that is an interesting analogy all three of the watch will have sleep tracking the series 7 is a great option if you can find some good deal before they are out of stock the bigger screen is nice to have but the se is a great watch and best value for feature but still i would lean 7 or 8 if the budget support it not a stupid question at all the watch will do auto update thank you for subscribing to see more video in the future have a great day suze
13031,thanks for the informative review i really wasnt sure how about which watch to get but i think the cycle tracking of the 8 will come in handy especially with the temperature tracking that is a stellar feature and will really be useful
13032,thank you very much i am glad you enjoyed it i hope you enjoy the series 8 it is a great watch and nice to have those update
13033,just got a se over series 8 a i could not really find any real difference between the two i do not need to receive any haptic feedback regarding ovulation nor do i need that immediate access to ecg with that aside being a technophile i could not justify the cost difference between a couple of minor ip cert and a always on display decided to save the money on this choice hmms this weird for me a i always find reason to go with more premium edition of a product simply because i like more feature regardless just not this time edit please help convince me to return the se for a series 8 d
13034,i can appreciate what you are saying and the se is definitely the best value but to help convince you to return it the larger screen is really nice that larger format is what apple is moving forward with they are taking advantage of the extra space more you also quick charging if you use sleep tracking also consider a series 7 before they go out of stock there are good deal to be had hope i helped convince you
13035,se charging speed wa only thing that kept me stop buying it
13036,craig is tech talk i think so and i can imagine situation that i need quick charging for example when i forget to charge it before travelling
13037,if you do sleep tracking the quick charge is a great thing
13038,trust and believe him he is god fearing person i never regret meeting him he unlock io device icloud activation lock iwatch unlock and ipad unlocks
13039,buen video bro saludos desde venezuela
13040,imma just buy a series 7 cellular because the series 8 barely doe anything more for me
13041,i have an iphone and a macbook pro computer i need a watch to complete the echo system but i will never buy an apple watch whose battery doe not last even a day
13042,i bought the ultra but i kinda regret it if it were dollar600 i could stomach it much better but dollar800 is just so much for what it is idk
13043,which series would you have preferred to purchase
13044,i can understand what you are saying sunday video is about the ultra and some feature to consider or you may regret it thanks for watching and sharing your thought
13045,i just got the apple watch series 8 41mm product red
13046,very cool congratulation i like the red
13047,dear craig your video here helped me greatly i am an avid runner and almost got tricked lol into buying ultra from the hype but i tried one on at best buy and it wa unnecessarily ginormous so i just ordered a aw7 cellular dollar440 amazon now and already own a aw6 gps so i can use battery burning cell only for my 1 to 3 hour daily run thank you oh and i see my one iphone 13 pro max can be used for both watch but is the daily switching between these watch simply taking one off putting other on and passcoding in or is there more to it like in setting each time esp with cellular thank you
13048,craig is tech talk wonderful thank you craig
13049,very cool glad to help i am glad you also tried on the ultra smart move saving the money with the 7 and cellular the watch will automatically switch by default when you put a watch on that will be the active watch with the 6 you just will not have cellular both watch can be setup uniquely or have your new 7 be a clone of your 6
13050,option d buy series 7
13051,craig is tech talk i picked mine up a few day ago new and it wa one of the last 8 so that option being new will not last much tbh
13052,that is a great option especially with sale
13053,i just got the 8 since i am fairly new to the apple ecosystem i do not know much so coming from a galaxy watch 4 this is a major improvement lightweight perfect for being active and just daily use i will save the galaxy setup for the more sophisticated occasion and my all red series 8 watch along with the new airpod pro for daily use
13054,the apple watch ultra is amazing lasted me about a solid 36 40 hour that is including 2 sleep cycle cellular usage to send receive call away from phone and a 7 5 hour workout to continuously monitor my calorie output while at my labor intensive job on top of 2 1 5 hour workout session at the gym the battery and phone call experience a well a the bigger brighter screen alone is worth it in my opinion i comfortably used an apple watch a a phone substitute for about 2 day i am also a moderate backpacker which is just icing on the cake highly recommend
13055,im pretty sure there is no series 9 next year like iphone
13056,i just got the ultra today
13057,this will be my first apple watch so i am either getting a series 8 or an se i do not need an ultra
13058,same scenario 2 choice here which one did you end up getting
13059,only way to justify an apple watch is if you are replacing your phone
13060,thanks just ordered a series 3
13061,the ultra last 18 hour under lte connection which is what you promoted long time ago
13062,my apology for the misunderstanding yeah it is great there is an option now that will get lte user some real use time out of it i have not activated cellular yet but i am curious if i can leave the phone home all day thanks for the clarification
13063,i mean you promoted lte smart watch usage before and boom congratulation you get one now
13064,the ultra ha just come out and would not have been possible to promote 18 hour on lte in previous video no apple watch will get you continuous 18 hour lte 18 hour is apple standard battery life claim over wifi cellular eats into that total number
13065,i still do not have an apple watch the next gen ultra maybe be lighter
13066,am i the only one having issue getting text alert on my new se watch
13067,se the other 2 are total marketing nonsense
13068,probably the series 8 or the ultra if it ha all series 8 capability which now i have to look up cause i am confused by your video thanks
13069,useful video
13070,i can wear all day with no issue
13071,i am getting the ultra
13072,very cool let u know if you like it mine come in tomorrow thanks for watching
13073,i am going for ultra only reason is my upgrade from s6 to either s8 steel cellular will anyway land me to 699dollar it is better to go with ultra for 799dollar and get way more upgrade
13074,it is definitely way more for that dollar100 hopper you enjoy the ultra
13075,i do not regret getting my iwatch se with cellular version my iphone 12 mini battery died at the end of the day and i can still rely on the watch and got me entertained on podcast and messaging
13076,very cool that is good to hear thanks for sharing
13077,you are the best
13078,you are too kind thank you
13079,the ultra look like a tank i am going to hold off until i can see it i want something i can use for all occasion series 8 is that for me or even the 7 i would not mind wearing it with formal attire on or for recreation etc it is sleeker looking with the rounded off edge etc ultra look like it is for specific us and scenario i think sleeve will hate it lol or fancy band lol
13080,i can definitely see what you are saying i am curious if i could use it a my only watch but my initial thought are that i am going to have to switch between the 8th and ultra most people do not have a youtube channel to blame buying two watch on thanks for sharing and watching
13081,got ta go with ultra got lost in seattle last night using the gps on my series 7 the 2gps for more accurate direction is a must
13082,i order the ultra to replace a apple 5 should receive it oct 4th
13083,i think i am going with the series 7 cellular i found it online for 280 dollardollar
13084,keepthefaith ebay
13085,where
13086,i see too many people addicted to their phone it is pretty sad even at the gym and all the damage they are causing to their neck but i think i will get the 8 a my first watch with cellular so i do not have to be on the phone and not be addicted
13087,se 2022 v series 7 a a first smart watch which one would be better value
13088,craig is tech talk thanks man may be able to snag the 7 at a good price
13089,i would say the 7 if you find a price you like the larger always on display is a big one the additional space and keyboard is nice
13090,i got my apple 7 watch in july after my 3rd fitbit versa failed i am addicted to the fitness and sleep tracking data so i did not want to wait for the 8 i am glad i did not wait i would have wanted the 7 over the 8 anyway and i go the cellular even though it is not activated i believe the cellular 7 battery probably last longer than the non cellular i may activate it eventually but my iphone x is nearby most of the time i wa hoping to use the apple watch a a golf gps but during a game there are so many other operation going on during the 4 hour that it make more sense just to continue with my garmin golf watch thanks for putting out great review
13091,a b i miss the specific health data the fitbit had to which i wa accustomed i enjoy the apple watch and it additional service which communicate with my apple watch i enjoy the apple watch is monthly challenge the versa is a very capable smart watch if monitoring your health is what you need and if you are not a fan of apple the fitbit sense even track body temperature to more accurately track sleep data
13092,do you miss the fitbit thinking of getting one because i want a small watch
13093,i can not decide between series 7 or new se
13094,doe the new apple watch se have the backtrack compass feature current owner of the series 4 and thinking of grading to the 8 or se
13095,wa thinking about getting the ultra
13096,i bought the se it will be here tomorrow
13097,i figured lol
13098,sorry that wa a spam comment that i just had to get rid of
13099,what did i win
13100,my series 3 is officially unsupported by apple so it is time to upgrade great video by the way
13101,hey craig i have a question for you that is completely unrelated to watch i just ordered my iphone and decided i should probably switch my internet over at the same time he is calling me back tomorrow and i need to decide by then i am using 4g internet a i am about to move to the country and it will be more reliable than the other option although no chance of gigabit speed tp link have recently brought out a deco x20 4g which look like a great option for me but there is a deco x50 4g coming soon the x20 is ax1800 and the x50 is ax3000 all other spec look the same but i am going to switch off the 5ghz band s a it give me migraine so is there any reason to wait and get the x50 or am i going to get the same result from both given i am only going to use 2 4ghz
13102,bruh i got a series 1 what should i get lol
13103,craig is tech talk i got it for christmas like in 2017 i think i do not remember ight you got me sold ima get the 8
13104,you should get an award for using the watch for that long any of them are going to feel like a huge improvement i say get the 8 for the larger screen and having everything you can get you earned it holding on to your 1 do not settle for an se after that many year
13105,my apple watch 3 is kaput glitchy and doe not connect to my phone anymore so i am looking at the se 44mm are any of these smart watch fitness tracker durable at all
13106,kind of torn between the new se and the series 7 help
13107,why is this oceanic app for the apple watch ultra only available a a subscription type arrangement the app logbook is restricted to a total of 12 dive and offer very basic dive computer functionality without air integration the only reason i want to buy this dollar800 upgrade to my existing apple watch is for this dive computer capability i only scuba dive while on vacation approx 2 3 dive per year it would be a waste of money to pay 12 month of a subscription for only 2 3 dive i might a well buy a proper dive computer for dollar300 400 and own it outright with all the dive logging capability included and no subscription required i will not buy the apple ultra watch if a subscription is required to use one of the key function
13108,i hate that apple think that a cycle tracker is somehow interesting to woman when buying an expensive sport watch but do not care to make their newest and best watch in a size accustomed to fit most woman
13109,ordered the ultra day one i am a mechanical watch collector if you are in the hobby it mean you also collect watch strap and metal watch bracelet by far the strongest selling point for me with the ultra is the new ocean band specifically the yellow ocean band essentially the biggest reason i am buying the ultra is the new ocean band and all the feature of the ultra watch itself just happen to be icing on the cake if my prior apple watch wa not the smaller 41mm incompatible size then i would simply buy the new ocean band separately for dollar99 but i need to upgrade to the larger size apple watch in any event to have an apple watch compatible with the size of the new ocean band which band is of course made for the 49mm ultra but compatible with 45mm apple watch i believe very few people know what the ocean band actually is and what a big deal it is first if you know anything about the history of the design of the apple watch then you know that the primary designer of the apple watch or at least the person who originally developed the design idea s which were used in the creation of the apple watch is marc newson then going further down the rabbit hole long before apple developed the apple watch newson designed ikepod watch not ipod but ikepod yep originally just pod and there wa an ikepod dive watch model called seaslug which included an extremely unique and innovative rubber strap from which apple is new ocean band no doubt got it origin to me the addition of the drilled out tubular hole in the ocean band make it even cooler a an aside if you did not already know the design for the regular original rubber strap for the apple watch wa taken straight from ikepod watch
13110,hi can the apple watch se detect irregular rhythm notification and doe it warm you of issue
13111,no to both thing
13112,i wa thinking about upgrading my aw5 to aw8 but giving it a thought about few day it is not necessary what always buck me is the low battery hiking about 7 hour and the watch is dead why should i spend money on a watch that ha the same battery life a my current one the ultra look very nice but is toooo big for my small female wrist hoping the aw9 get better battery life finger are crossed then i would upgrade without hesitation
13113,i am petite and hear you i did order and will see i have a s s6 and i will keep that for every day if i keep the ultra i do however do a lot of off grid long hike so i am hoping i can tolerate it for hiking and perhaps long ride
13114,yes it suck that apple doe not make the ultra in a size accustomed to fit woman too
13115,a 100 meter water resistance rating doe not mean it would necessarily work 100 meter below sea level a 30 meter or 3 atm rating is generally considered good for hand washing 50 meter for showering and 100 meter for swimming at or close to the surface most dive watch are 200 meter iso certified which is a higher standard than just 200 meter i heard apple is saying this watch is good for diving up to 40 meter below sea level
13116,if you a lazy guy but pretend to be an adventurer than buy the apple watch ultra
13117,if it wa not for the new ultra i would be keeping my seven watch gps i agree the seven watch gps is much better value than the current se or the eight
13118,hello if i get the ultra must i buy a cellular plan for it or can i somehow use it solely with regular bluetooth because i really never leave without my cellphone anyways and i like the other upgrade of the ultra such a look style battery etc
13119,thank you larry
13120,hello julie like larry said you do not have to activate it you would set it all up exactly the same just do not enable cellular your phone will stay connected with bluetooth and wifi when at home
13121,you do not have to get cellular plan for it if you do not want to use the cellular function of it
13122,a a first time buyer confused between s7 and s8 is it worth getting the 8 if i do not care about temperature sensor much
13123,craig is tech talk is the se 44mm and the 8 45mm screen size difference noticiable
13124,the se is a great price if you are good with the smaller screen and do not need the additional sensor the se is the best value for feature
13125,if you do not care able the temperature sensor there is not a lot of reason there is crash detection on the new 8 and se but not much else ha changed from the 7 it is a good chance to save money getting a 7 a store try to clear out for the series 8
13126,same i do not really care and would use those feature much wonder what is better 7 8 or even new se
13127,watching this video made me cancel my series 8 pre order and get a series 7
13128,there is not a lot of change it is a good chance to save some i hope you enjoy the new watch
13129,do not trust fall detection took a hard spill out of my wheelchair hit my head on a curb layed unconscious for a few min b4 found do not trust fall detection
13130,i am sorry to hear about your experience that sound horrible and disappointing that the watch did not help thank you for sharing
13131,i upgraded from my series 3 to a series 7 today i got it for dollar400 for the 45 mm aluminum midnight model i wa going to preorder the 8 but i am glad to save the dollar130 for a few le new feature
13132,the keyboard tho
13133,i am really thinking of it i have a 38mm aw 3 now and it is kinda slow and i could enjoy it a lot more with a larger display i am getting big into walking now and kinda hope to run again knee pain permitting a i am getting older the ekg would kinda be nice i would love the ultra display intensity but can not justify dollar800 for a watch owch
13134,i am with you i wish apple would make a senior citizen discount program or something to bring the price down if you are older then you know you can get a watch that last a lifetime for le than 800 dollar
13135,postersm 71 ever use the ekg how is battery life i am lucky to get 18 hr but that is what is advertised at least
13136,i went from a free apple watch 3 christmas gift and treated myself six month ago to the 45 mm 7 and i absolutely love it when you wait several generation you truly do get a nice upgrade
13137,i wish they would have made an ultra with a smaller face for u more petite athlete i am 5 1 a buck twenty so it is gon na look silly i do not care though i am doin it
13138,i think we should not buy it but should give apple a clear message that we expect them to do something for their female customer just a well we do not live in a men s world anymore and do not have to pretend it is ok to make a watch far too big for most woman
13139,it is surprising that they did not that is going to be a big watch for you i love that you are going for it though and are going to put it to use
13140,i am going from a 4 to an ultra i ordered the black trail loop band and doe not ship until november i am hoping to get it sooner
13141,i really hope they show up earlier than that congratulation on the upgrade that is going to be a big update
13142,if i am on the market for an apple watch it will be the ultra that watch is fire
13143,it is pretty cool i am liking the look too
13144,very useful video thank you never own an apple watch before a bit straggling in choosing between se2 and s7
13145,he always on scream look at me and drain your battery imho i have the original se and you just raise your wrist and it is on
13146,craig is tech talk i am a delivery driver for work so the always on display is very handy i will bet the s8 and i am upgrading from my 4 because the battery doe not last all day anymore
13147,thank you very much i am glad that it wa helpful either watch is going to be great and perform pretty much the same it come down to that larger screen and a couple of feature the se2 is a great value especially when comparing cellular
13148,i order the ultra ready for it bigger the better for me
13149,very nice i hope you like it i am excited to see how big this thing is thanks for watching
13150,i wish the ultra wa available in space gray
13151,it would be nice to have a darker option like that
13152,ultra hand down my traditional watch are big and heavy this ultra will more closely match that size but with all the additional iwatch item it will replace my 6 very well it the battery life hand down that is the bonus
13153,i think the battery life is going to be great especially with cellular too very cool you are getting one thanks for watching
13154,i have s3 apple watch is it worth the upgrade to ultra
13155,craig is tech talk breaktime101 cheer for fast reply is still deciding whether to wait a bit for price to drop on them or get it straight away
13156,craig is tech talk of course did you see my question on the number of homepods allowed on one account did you ever find an answer thanks
13157,thanks breaktime for the answer
13158,yes like breaktime say there are no more update for the 3 the ultra is going to be such a huge screen upgrade and performance it should feel fast next to the 3 i hope you enjoy it
13159,yes a the s3 will not support the newest software
13160,this year it s only one to get ultra ofc
13161,i am with you thanks for watching
13162,i have apple watch 7 and iphone 13 pro got them january of this year have not even had them for a year and see no reason to upgrade
13163,there really is not much of a reason to upgrade you have the larger screen of the 7 and the 13 pro is a great phone thanks for watching
13164,everyone keep talking about going with cellular because it is only dollar50 more on the se and while that is cool no one want to mention that is not the only cost cellular service is not free on your apple watch your cell carrier will charge you additional fee for that usually another dollar10 per month while dollar120 per year doe not seem like much you are still paying a subscription fee for your apple watch i am not the type of person to ever leave my phone at home on purpose so the added cost of having two cellular device on me at all time doe not make sense
13165,i kiteboard so being able to call from out on the water is very comforting
13166,i use the phone function all the time in my job where i can not have my phone with me hospital but want to be reachable for important call being outside when i don t want to bring my phone or am doing sport for convenience sitting on the sofa or not being close to my phone but wanting to make a quick call it is really worth it to me
13167,that is a great point if you do not want to leave your phone or in the car then cellular doe not do much to help it is great for when you can not have your phone on you like some people job require or you just want to get away from your phone thanks for watching
13168,battery life of 7 series v 8
13169,but what is about yet to be launched battery saver mode for ultra amp 8
13170,apple ha rated them the same and there is no spec difference that wa shown
13171,where can i get a the discounted apple watch 7 can you share a link
13172,amazon ha some great deal here is the cellular 7 link
13173,cost of living crisis yet so many people paying for these watch
13174,i am considering buying the s7 nike 45mm since it is very simillar and also cheaper
13175,it make sense if you get a good deal not a lot of change
13176,can you sleep track with the se or not really
13177,yes you get the same sleep tracking a the other watch
13178,we can test the car crash feature while we are on a roller coaster just to test it
13179,i am curious if they have factored those in now i am curious
13180,what happened to the glucose test i have not heard anything about it anymore that is what i have been waiting for i am really questioning the apple product
13181,okay thank you that is what i wa starting to think
13182,i doubt that is even technically possible do not wait for it
13183,my guess is that they can not get it dialed in or can not get it approved the problem is that it all based on rumor apple may have no plan to put on in there are so many rumor that have not happened on these watch thanks for watching
13184,got a 7 watch 45 mm aluminium would like the apple watch ultra just the price gbp849 pound sterling in the uk expensive
13185,it is a huge price i am blaming it on my youtube channel unfortunately that wont work for everyone the series 7 is a great watch to hold on to until we see how this ultra shake out
13186,i preordered the se i have the iphone 13 pro i had the series 3 so i upgraded to the se
13187,hello carissa the se is going to be a great update for you you get the larger better looking screen and a nice performance boost i hope you enjoy it
13188,not this year maybe next year to upgrade just not worth the money
13189,i can respect that thanks for watching joe
13190,the one with solar charging
13191,i want that one
13192,i think to get series 8 because track my workout i am not interested to get the improved one
13193,the series 8 is such a great watch i love my series 7 hope you enjoy it
13194,will the new se have qwerty keyboard
13195,no it will not that is only on the larger 7 and now ultra i wish it did
13196,where is fucking watch 8 squire design waste of money same watch 5 6 7 8 design
13197,i want the squared off design too i can not believe they have not done it after all these year
13198,forgot to mention one big drawback of the watch se it doe not support fast charging such a the 7 8 and ultra
13199,doe the new apple watch se support always on screen feature
13200,no
13201,i ordered the series 8 but i wish it would come with the flat screen
13202,just a few day ago before the apple event i bought a brand new apple watch series 7 45mm gps only for dollar100 buck off at dollar329 i think i made a smart choice especially sense the series 8 is not that big of and upgrade
13203,the se if you want to save a much money a possible series 8 if you wan na get a few more feature in the base model if you start upgrading the series 8 very quickly it stop making sense and you should absolutely get the ultra
13204,the apple watch herm s series 8 ha a space black stainless steel case to match my iphone 14 pro is finish which is a win win for me personally
13205,i have an aluminum series 7 and a stainless steel series 5 i ordered the ultra mainly because of the size i have a large mechanical watch collection and the apple watch ha always seemed very small to me
13206,my first ever apple watch is ultra
13207,i will most likely get the series 8 once it officially release i am still on the series 3 lol
13208,that is what i wa waiting for
13209,doe the new se ha a mini keyboard now
13210,yawn thank you
13211,yawn i wa waiting for that feature
13212,yawn that kinda suck
13213,no sadly
13214,seriously ultra is not that good looking
13215,im in between the 7 and the 8 se what should i consider
13216,same here probably going to get the 7
13217,same
13218,suggest me guy going to buy firsy time i should go for series 8 ot se
13219,my wife and i are senior citizen and safety and medical feature of the series 8 are very attractive i ordered one for each of u
13220,how are you liking them
13221,for me brother
13222,i have had the historic series 1 since the series 3 came out and i have almost bought the series 5 and then 6 when it came out but the new se ha really drawn my eye and needle to say i am overdue for a upgrade plus that price being nearly a low a the series 6 and what not it is definitely with it
13223,i only hope apple release a solar powered apple watch in the near future
13224,like cartier released it is solar series
13225,gabby lopez i think exactly the same
13226,james yeah not near future but most likely in the ling run
13227,thats gon na be like a 1 000 dollar or more lol
13228,i do not see that happening for a long time the tech is not even close to there yet and i do not think even apple is close to cracking it
13229,the biggest user of this will be emergency service considering police firefighter and ambo
13230,i want the 45mm screen series 8
13231,for a fist apple watch will you say an apple watch 8 is overkill
13232,your welcome let u know how it go
13233,craig is tech talk thanks pretty sure i will go for the 8 then thanks
13234,not at all i would go for the 8 for the larger screen and the additional feature the processor is the same across them the bigger screen format is something that apple is going to keep taking advantage of with update but the se will perform the same minus the screen and some sensor if your budget support it get an 8 or save some money going with a 7 you might regret going with the se if you are on the fence
13235,there is only one watch to buy buying anything but the ultra mean in 4 year your battery will be wearing out and you will be looking for a new watch my four year old series 5 just got traded in on the ultra because apple would not work on it yearly update are becoming so incremental that the best bet is to buy their best battery and that is the ultra and along with it you get their finest piece toughest and most unique piece of jewelry
13236,what i noticed on the ultra model is that you probably easily can change the battery the back plane ha 4 screw since the battery last 2 time longer your battery live will theoretically last 2 x longer these more expensive watch have ecg and can now detect atrial fibrillation detecting this can save a lot of people for getting a stroke 175000 people suffer from this every year in the usa alone and the blood saturation sensor is also a killing feature it can detect sleep disorder and can be live safer long term
13237,strongly disagree it is massive and far le versatile than a regular aw it is going to look ridiculous on most people especially in anything but the most casual outfit
13238,i got the ultra
13239,ultra have the ecg
13240,that is a great idea it is nice that you can switch between them
13241,craig is tech talk i definitely will i am going to still keep my s6 in i want to wear something small
13242,very cool i hope you enjoy it let u know after you get it
13243,seeing no big difference between series 7 and series 8 i ordered my first apple watch today with some serious discount i ordered my favorite one i e stainless steel silver case 45 mm
13244,craig is tech talk thanks mate
13245,craig is tech talk brought the 8 the ultra look like it gon na be huge
13246,very cool i hope you enjoy it there is not a big difference it is a good chance to save
13247,i am thinking about upgrading from my series 4 to the series 8 but the ultra is tempting also
13248,just get the 8 and buy a case spigen make really good case i have had my 4 for year too and never cracked it
13249,i have a cracked series 4 and ill be moving to the ultra i have been waiting for a longer battery better screen for a while and even thought about going to the garmin watch epix 2 the integration with the iphone ecosystem is a big driving factor for me while evaluating already have mine ordered and it will arrive mid end of october
13250,the ultra look cool i think it is a watch people are going to have to watch video and try on it is big and hefty i am looking forward to it
13251,thank you so much craig for detailed explanation maybe the series 8 is the best choice
13252,series 6 s is the very best deal
13253,i ordered the cellular se 2 yesterday i am excited to enter the apple watch gang i have never found the watch accesible until now at this price point i am still very happy with my iphone 11 so having the watch will be my upgrade
13254,i got the same watch se 2 44 mm really good solid watch
13255,same got an iphone 11 pro still and ordered the se watch except gps only a my carrier doe not support esim
13256,you will enjoy it
13257,very cool that is awesome welcome and i hope you enjoy it your 11 is still good the watch will be a nice addition
13258,most probably getting the se it is gon na be my first apple watch lol
13259,go for it
13260,7series is fourth candidate
13261,craig is tech talk i am sorry of low level of english
13262,that is a great point and one i had to make sure to add good saving to be had
13263,coming from a series 6 i wanted to upgrade to something that looked slightly different i checked out the series 8 in stainless but that end up being more expensive than the ultra so might a well spend that money on the ultra since it look different is more resistant to damage and ha better battery life
13264,craig is tech talk no problem sleeping with it for me hope it is been the same for you
13265,sheel mirji this is why i went for s series 8 when upgrading my series 5 this year the ultra is superior but look goofy for daily use my theory is apple is trying to convince u to own two
13266,ultra is really pointless unless ur doing extreme activity all the time scuba diving climbing mountain stuff like plus it is bulky make it look ugly while the regular look class
13267,it is really interesting pricing i think apple know that once people put that ultra on and see how big it is they will pay the same price for the smaller stainless it is a win either way for them if there wa a smaller ultra i do not think they would be able to price them the same i can see a smaller ultra being just the right size i am excited for the ultra but am concerned about it being realistic a daily use watch i can not imagine sleeping with it i am curious what everyone end up thinking mine is supposed to arrive tomorrow
13268,same here coming from series 6 alimunium cellular doe not make sense to go with series 8 stainless steel price and the fact that i have a lot of damage on my aluminium case in addition to the glass
13269,i am good with my series 7 45mm nike with my olive flack black band with the olive nike bounce face is all good for a another year
13270,craig titanium clasp me it is a g hook
13271,series 8 cellular
13272,great rewiew
13273,thank you curtis
13274,i bought the serie 8 nike edition because i sold my serie 3 for 175 dollar canadian last month or so i am gon na receive my serie 8 next friday and i plan to check at my local apple store the ultra i am a runner so i always use a rubber loop i need to check the alpine and the trail loop and the diver loop too i may return my serie 8 and order the ultra when and only when i will be able to try it at the apple store
13275,upgrading from s7 to ultra always wanted titanium for a non rip off hermes style price
13276,it is bulky heavier and can still get stretched also cost 500 dollar to fix that is no for me i will get the regular 8
13277,hey u forgot to mention how far you can hear the watch siren when you dive
13278,i have been trying to save up for an apple watch for 2 year every time that i get close something break down or need is replacing
13279,i am coming from a 4 so i am excited for the 8 and i am getting the 8 cuz the new feature for cycle and protecting information a i had to delete my cycle apps due to the religious war on freedom in america
13280,well put i am coming from no watch history so 8 look great
13281,i would like a series se apple watch but i want the ecg
13282,craig is tech talk alright i will
13283,i would say keep an eye out for some deal on the series 7 a the holiday approach you might find some deal that are close to the current se price
13284,do not waste your money on these new feature
13285,thanks for watching
13286,the problem is they are using the same chip from watch series 6 series 7 amp 8 ultra all ha s6 chip rebranded a the s7 amp s8 i do not understand why i swear i have a very strong feel the same will be done next year i am sticking to my watch series 6 until they make a brand new chip that make it a lot better than the series 8 and ultra hopefully next year there is an s9 chip like a new s9 chip that make the battery life at least 2 and a half day without low power mode and they make the screen to body ratio higher also they need to add a couple of new feature if the series 9 add that compass feature then they will probably just add extra feature or no feature for the next ultra and wait till 2024 that is another big problem with apple there are people that hold out and wait a year more and then be disappointed and wait another year
13287,cuz it a watch it doe not need a new chip every year watch is already fast response is fantastic on it they probably will not add a new one till the o need a faster chip
13288,series 6 is still the best deal
13289,other than a larger screen and a couple of sensor not a lot of change since the 6
13290,none
13291,i only want it with apple note why can not we access our personal workout and other plan including swimming without the iphone if i am right we can call text and pay with the watch but we can not access our apple note
13292,nice review
13293,i do not see the point of se at all u get smart watch for it feature not just tell the time
13294,you are right but more feature mean more battery power consumption hence poor battery life and enabling low power mode turn almost all feature off no use i think ultra would be best available option so far is not it
13295,hi fantastic video again in the u the apple watch ultra is dollar850 convert to british pound is gbp732 70 it is cheaper to buy from the u then buying it in the uk for gbp850 00 so i am waiting to buy the new ultra next year when i am visiting family in the u do the same with the iphone 15 pro max not going to upgrade this year
13296,the price in the u doe not include tax usually around 10percent and with gbp down it doe not make sense to buy in the u plus if you have to pay import custom duty it is going to be more expensive
13297,all i know is the apple watch series 8 in stainless steel is a complete rip off more than ever this year apple really should have priced case variant that at dollar600 and dollar650 respectively the fact that the 45 mm stainless steel apple watch cost is identical to the the apple watch ultra with all those amazing feature is kind of odd to say the least
13298,i bought 8 series stainless do not even bothered or thought about getting ultra because of the longer battery life and other function sitting in the office and seeing patient with aluminum or ultra look very off to me haha
13299,i will always buy stainless steel feel richer and i love the appearance it is also cool to have something slightly different than most others
13300,keith yarbrough you are the first i have seen say this i agree they are testing the market to see if consumer are willing to own two apple watch
13301,i thought i wa the only one to notice this it is a no brainer
13302,variant lol
13303,i think the se is good for someone who is just starting on having one and then move on to another one if you think you need all the feature
13304,yes someone do not use their apple watch all the time get the apple watch se
13305,ultra is only for hard working people
13306,i have a 45mm s s7 love the look and function of the s8 ultra but it is way overkill for me and would look like a poser
13307,that is funny bryan it look like overkill for most people i do not think i could have the ultra a my only watch but i will not know until next week there really is no need for you to upgrade just not enough of an upgrade
13308,thanks always in depth information
13309,i wa looking to upgrade to a series 8 but the battery health on my series 6 is still 100percent so technically a good a new i use the series 4 it replaced overnight which is showing it age maybe instead i will get an se to replace that and maybe an 8 in six month or so
13310,the 6 is still the best deal
13311,the se is a great choice from a performance standpoint the 8 ha not seen any big speed jump over the 6 amp 7 depending on how soon you want it to buy i would keep an eye out on amazon and other place trying to clear inventory you might find a good deal on a 7 and get a screen size bump let u know how the se work out for you if you get it
13312,you say you like certain feature yet i do not see you wearing a watch curious very curious
13313,craig is tech talk glad u saw the silly humor in my remark your adorable and i did note you have a new watch on order
13314,that is funny i had not paid attention to the fact i wa not wearing mine thanks for pointing that out since i wa not actively demoing anything and wa in a hurry i completely missed it luckily i can back up my other apple watch video my wallet is definitely feeling that i use these thanks for watching
13315,thanks for the review i have an older series 3 watch and am deciding between the 7 or the new 8
13316,my regular watch need to get a battery change so i bought a 3 series discovered if i fall and need 911 3 series can make 911 call without cellular
13317,the 6 is best deal
13318,thank you for watching coming from a series 3 either would be a really nice update you will not see much of a difference in processing speed between the 7 and 8 the screen are the same i think it come down to the handful of new feature and if they add value you can save a good amount on the 7 this is apple comparison tool for a detailed breakdown of feature

13661,pin 1st best yt in whole yt giving best info
13662,1st
13663,ham first pin me
13664,yeah apple watch ultra and tesla go hand in hand
13665,haha literally
13666,hey daren how are you i just wanted to share that if you did more investing analysis video on aapl stock i would definitely tune in more often a it is my largest holding and i believe your second largest holding after tesla thanks
13667,daren yoong thank you for your kind response sound great in that case i have subscribed me too but hope it somewhat affordable
13668,yes aapl is 21percent of my public stock portfolio today will have periodic coverage when there are major development for apple looking forward to their new ar product in 2023
13669,loved this review man the speaker difference is insane
13670,daren yoong my ultra came today when i got back from work super stoked to go hiking tomorrow i will get to test it out
13671,agree
13672,i hope to get one soon just curio how big is your wrist it doe look good on your wrist i have 6 5 inch wrist but i do not have a apple store near me or a best buy to se how it will look on my wrist that is why i ask your size to compare thank you great video
13673,45mm only appeared from series 7 and that wa last year errrr how can then 45mm be around for many year before that it wa 44mm
13674,excellent video
13675,great to see that you have moved on to or rather added an apple watch ultra i am still happily wearing the apple watch edition series 5 in white ceramic i bought from you early in 2021 and should have gotten it signed by you would i have known that you become a youtube star soon after i have ordered the ultra a well for many of the benefit you mentioned but agree that the slimmer series 5 8 are more appropriate for formal event especially the white ceramic is a favourite of mine since i first got it with the edition series 2 it match an unbeatable number of clothing style and watch band i am curious to see how i like a titanium watch but still hope that ceramic return to the lineup at some point in the future
13676,had the white ceramic many year ago and it is a beautiful design maybe that is apple is strategy to have u grow a collection of apple watch
13677,for the sleeping i sleep on my right side so it is not a problem if i wear the ultra or my old apple watch my wife did not get hit since the serie 3 release while i sleep with her
13678,a a long term tesla investor and avid apple product user i really enjoy your video content keep it up btw i am malaysian living in los angeles
13679,thanks for the support leonard hope to see you in la or kl one day
13680,thanks for the review bos getting one soon
13681,great review daren still sticking with my apple watch se but i think the ultra will sell well apple advertised it for hardcore user but i think this watch will work just a well for people with big wrist big body size for me not quite really a i am skinny
13682,interesting i heard from a few people that they will not wear this in a formal setting if i have one i will wear it it will be a conversation piece at the party i do agree that brighter screen is important when you are outdoor when i jog it is very hard to see the time and distance from my activity tracker
13683,haha true it will be a conversation starter
13684,that red tesla model 3 good so nice
13685,what size of band is it and your wrist size
13686,i got the small strap size 130 160mm it is a bit too small for me and i would have got the medium size for future apple watch ultra strap 145 190mm
13687,i like how your wife play along nice review daren
13688,very fortunate to have her support
13689,speaker of this ultra watch is fantastic just make my samsung galaxy watch 5 pro speaker like rubbish
13690,agree the speaker on apple watch ultra is significan notly better
13691,hey man appreciate the video just wanted to let you know that your apple passcode wa shown in part of the video where you demonstrated the brightness of the watch maybe you could blur out sensitive information in future video or be aware of any possible data leak that can happen while filming
13692,agree have changed our apple watch passcodes after the video
13693,tan line alert
13694,it ha been 1 month already
13695,yes apple watch ultra launched on 23 sep
13696,great honest review
13697,thanks byron
13698,join me on the ultra lifestyle affiliate link
13699,m
13700,i settled for an 8 because of the ultras price even though i liked the look of it and hesitantly returned the 8 for an ultra 6 day later and couldnt be happier id pay more for it the display is night and day better snd it the first watch imo that look designed for a man and doesnt need a cover
13701,it the first time in my life that i can say tiny ding and scratch on the upper lip of this expensive electronic device actually make it look even cooler never said that before which is just how awesome the ultra is
13702,nice and honest review love the humour too enjoyed it ultrally no punt intended
13703,that watch is around 700 something there another around 1200 or more is there big difference between those thanks for the video
13704,ok get to the point mate 11 min of nothing i wanted to hear why should i buy it why it is so great is it functional or no but i hear blablabla longer power reserve blablabla
13705,i love my ultra and i feel naked if i am not wearing it a it can replace my phone for easy thing like call and text message i use the trail loop and the old nike sport rubber band and dress it up with a titanium band if i need to get fancy and take the wife on a date lol the battery life is my favorite thing about the watch
13706,lmao i love your video man
13707,ocean band is hand down the most comfortable band and bang for your buck i have all 3 band the trail loop get super dirty and hard to clean and the trail loop is strangely uncomfortable especially to take off
13708,i think i have an addiction to apple watch band i wear a different one everyday apple is are cool but amazon ha so many option i feel like a kid i a candy store they all look so good with the ultra
13709,love the awu last week i went on hike mountain mound under waterfall climbed boulder explored a cave it kept up amp look perfect
13710,you are living the true ultra lifestyle
13711,doe not it get a bit tiresome when awu reviewer have to apologise that they do not hike dive or climb mountain good review though
13712,let is get a little more range of motion on those row
13713,thanks coach
13714,suggest mentioning much brighter display and enhanced gps which can get you straight back to your hotel room in tokyo
13715,buy once cry once
13716,ahaha the psychology part is so truth i have used applewatch since series2 and now with the ultra being the more expensive i have got i am more motivated to work out you hear me out you spent this money now you are going to make it count
13717,have this watch on now clutch
13718,i love mine i just use it for everyday stuff nothing special awesome watch i purchased a titanium band and love it even more
13719,just ordered one yesterday
13720,awesome review loving my ultra been going between the trail loop in black gray and the midnight ocean band my favorite part are the display battery life and design
13721,good choice
13722,i got the ultra after a week i sent it back it wa over kill my apple watch 8 doe all i need
13723,success doe not consist in never making mistake but in never making the same one a second time george bernard shaw
13724,now if only my apple watch 4 would just give up the ghost
13725,great watch overall i must say the size bulk of the watch is probably it biggest downside i have never banged a watch into more door frame wall desk ever lol
13726,i really want an apple watch ultra but i am going to wait until it go on sale for best buy
13727,thing work out best for those who make the best of how thing work out john wooden
13728,love the shirt
13729,if they make a 42mm version they would sell a ton of them the next apple watch should be similar to the ultra if they want to improve sale i like the ultra but it is just too damned big also if you turn off the always on display you will only lose about 1percent of battery life per year
13730,i run 6 mile a day after my 30 minute gym workout the ultra is the bee is knee i do a half marathon ever month and a full marathon every 3 month i kept my apple watch se gen 1 i only put my se when i am charging the ultra great device
13731,i have had my ultra for probably like 2 3 month now and it is still like brand new and i still feel like it is new i love it
13732,you should do about the apple watch se 1 generation v apple watch se 2 generation
13733,damn our boy is getting buffed
13734,really proud of my gain so far i want to keep it going
13735,i got the series 8 for the always on display and the keyboard
13736,these are starting to get serious lol
13737,cool shirt
13738,too hip
13739,yes love it
13740,nice video jerma
13741,i loved the new look but i love tracking sleep and it wa horrible to track sleep with
13742,can i get the apple whach ultra for free plz
13743,ride electric unicycle great work out for the core and it is fun
13744,tattooed wrist excluded
13745,very nice video
13746,thank you
13747,the ultra is too ugly for my liking happy to stick with my series 7
13748,i wear mine all day besides showering i sleep with it and all and absolutely love it
13749,cuve ae nice
13750,same it charge while i groom i have the three apple band and rotate them throughout the day
13751,if they make a smaller ultra i am all over it
13752,david jacob ask yourself this question the ultra watch is huge and there are always going to be some people who will not buy it for that reason alone what reason is there for apple to not release a smaller one they sell different size of almost everything they make
13753,dan becker you might have a long wait
13754,david jacob the ultra is a designation of quality not size the iphone pro model come in two size im very confident apple will release a smaller version of the apple watch ultra
13755,i doubt they will it is meant to be big hence the name
13756,apple seems to have a way of turning their ultra or max model into status symbol or most desired of the time
13757,the ultra is my favourite apple watch to date i love it style overall design and sturdiness coming from a series 2 it wa a huge leap for me a you can imagine it doe not look too big on my wrist 17 5 cm and so far i find it pretty comfortable to wear for extended period of time oh and i love the flat display everything is much more readable
13758,but it is so god damn ugly
13759,in the eye of the beholder
13760,gregsgadgets i guess that our opinion is different i want that big display but it is just not my style
13761,garmin watch look better cu there round just my opinion
13762,it is beautiful
13763,lol eye bee m
13764,i would love to see one in a darker casing i am not a fan of that silver i do not have a problem with the price but i am not going to spend that kind of money on a watch unless it can go at least a week or two on a charge
13765,it might be able to go 4 5 day on low power mode
13766,apple watch ultra is my favorite apple watch
13767,nice video im using the fitbit versa2 1 year ago now looping for apple watch and come to you video i bought now the apple watch 8 thank you good video

13982,what hand gesture feature
13983,hi great tutorial and great video overall one thing i noticed in your video around the 11 40 mark wa the time on your iphone wa different than the watch time they were out of sync also i noticed the second hand jumped a few time a i continued watching with that particular watch face not sure if it is a glitch in the watch or the software anyhow thanks for the great tutorial
13984,any jump is me editing out maybe mistake a i talk etc the time sync could be because i had the watch set to 5 min ahead i can not open the video at the moment but i am assuming it wa that
13985,what is the emergency number that will be dialled different country have different number
13986,dhtv thanks for that
13987,i am not 100percent but it ha way of knowing maybe the phone carrier or phone number or maybe location
13988,great video i have yet to ever own an apple watch very interested in one though but having a hard time choosing which one to get a a first time buyer the se 2 series 8 or the ultra i am a senior and not super techy i am kinda leaning to the series 8 but still undecided your thought would be appreciated thx cheer from canada
13989,thanks glad you liked the video your best bet is to compare both the se and series 8 if the medical feature are important to you the series 8 would be the way to go aside from that it becomes a decision made on smaller detail in my opinion

14243,nice
14244,apple watch se 2022 u apple watch se 2022 uk
14245,first video that ive watched from ur channel and i noticed 2 thing 1 u said 2 different screen size a few time first u said it had 41mm and then u said 40mm and then went back to 41mm 2 u didnt correct urself in the video by adding a visual note that popped up when u were saying the wrong screen size most do that in the editing process just a note for future vids if it something u wan na take into concideration but besides that great video and it made me switch from wanting a series 7 to the se 2nd i feel like the new feature would obvi be an upgrade but what i can get from the series 7 8 compared to se 2nd just might not be worth it also taking in the difference that each model cost coming from the series 4 that is
14246,just got the se2 went for my first run and goddam this thing is clunky paused itself through half of my run and am i the only one that think unlocking your watch and navigating the fitness app while running suck hopefully i am missing something here a a noob but so far this thing suck a fat one
14247,got mine today
14248,congrats and enjoy
14249,dion have you found a portable charger for the se2
14250,can i get the apple whach ultra for free plz i always wanted one
14251,thanks next time i will take you le seriously
14252,of course if you win it is all yours
14253,nice video though
14254,well i would but i would not ask for one
14255,dion schuddeboom hey it wa just a joke i would never take a free whach
14256,nice review although i prefer the round galaxy watch screen over the rectangular apple watch shape is a non issue for functionality and usability
14257,TRUE
14258,who do all apple reviewer talk so stupid the new apple watch
14259,great review i have had it for 10 day and really enjoy it this one day battery life you can make it 2 and a half with the low power mode which i use because for me is the same do not need hr on every second ecg and blood oxygen i do not need at all especially for 150 eur more only fast charging is kind of missing p s you have to use it more for sport a well it is very good a a running and sport watch
14260,hi martin thanks for your feedback
14261,the only reason i got an se 2 apple watch is it wa only dollar5 a month extra on my plan so i figured why the hell not if i do not like it oh well well honestly the little fucker is so useful when you do not even think about it and keep you away from actually using your phone for minimal task that lead to session of other social medium and apps whereas the majority of the application on the watch are strictly for productivity and health
14262,i wa so bummed if i am going to get the cellular capable variant but thanks to you i will also skip that since i always bring my phone with me
14263,i get where you are coming from so in that case start from scratch and manually carry over file
14264,i just got my se 2 today
14265,thank you so much for this review i never had an apple watch because i felt i didnt need it but for the new job i got i can not be checking my phone and in case of a emergency i think this watch will do just great
14266,can you take a shower with this watch
14267,what shall i say in it exercise app it suggests that you can even swim with it but apple is not giving a guarantee when you do and i know someone who had been swimming and showering with his 7 first without problem but at present some of the function have been affected so in short better do not do it
14268,i got my se 2 in silver yesterday afternoon from target i accidentally dropped my last apple watch se on the floor in the bathroom i put it on charge for overnight i noticed a few crack on the screen yikes i did used it a little bit i kind of cut my finger a tiny bit on one of the crack i got it in a smaller size so that i still can used my watch band towards it i even have series 1 and 2 that i bought refurbished they are just backup i can not get those updated a current apple watch
14269,thanks for sharing and sorry to hear about the misfortune
14270,i got the watch after pouring through your video thanks for the guidance the se version is more than enough for me
14271,glad i could help
14272,thank you for the video very informative and very well made keep up the great work
14273,thanks will do
14274,tou would not need to take your phone with you if you had the cellular watch
14275,TRUE
14276,i like the way you explained about the se2 it is really helpful now i am really buying the se2
14277,enjoy it
14278,do you think they intentionally do not make the battery last long
14279,dion schuddeboom garmin watch can last for week
14280,interesting thought would not see the advantage in doing so on the contrary
14281,okay it is surprising to see how many people bought the se2 a their first watch it is my first apple watch too i have been thinking of it for year because it is way too expensive for a watch i can finally afford it now
14282,enjoy it
14283,wow i am glad i saw someone wearing a watch in the right hand like me
14284,hi i buy my first apple watch serie 5 same price that se 2020 or wait more time and refund more cash for se 2022 worth
14285,life is tough
14286,dion schuddeboom yep and now i need to decide if ip 11 pro or 12 and ipad 9na or 10ma haha
14287,well the s5 ha always on display
14288,it is very comfortable to watch your video when you announce the spec you are talking about in the top left corner a long a you explain them i am a visual learner who learns and process information best when i can see the information in text form thank you for making these video i really like them
14289,glad you like them
14290,there is no extra cost for the cellular if you have t mobile
14291,good to know
14292,why do you use them upside down
14293,hi mikey i get this question often i am left handed and it is the way i like to wear it
14294,i wa seriously considering the cellular version until you mentioned it needed a separate data plan thanks you saved me some money
14295,thanks for the nice review but i wa wondering why you are wearing it upside down a the crown is at the bottom instead of usual position on the top
14296,well it turn out to be the number 1 question
14297,dion schuddeboom ohh yes i figured it out when i watched the video again my bad
14298,i am left handed and that is the way i like it
14299,this review is so helpful for someone like me who recently got an iwatch se2 thanks dion

14301,i bought one of these a few day ago let me tell you i have had lot of watch but never have i had anything a cheap and nasty a this i am a big apple fan if they make it i have got it unfortunatley i had a huawei gt2 pro bough for me a couple of year ago so held off an and apple watch i am really sad to say that that watch mades apple is effort look and feel like a kid toy doe everything the apple doe with more class and a way better build quality and is gbp40 cheaper
14302,hi julius thanks for sharing your view
14303,thank you for an informative guide a a newbie to apple watch you have answered all of my pondering question i had
14304,i am thinking of getting my first apple watch would the one with out cellular connect to the airpod pro
14305,yes
14306,watching this 4 week later
14307,i went from a wallet to a ridge just so i do not carry a lot and now i picked up a se with cellular plan awesome idea i get to leave my phone home most the time and do not need to carry a lot work great
14308,you often do not have wi fi availability can you make call with bluetooth connectivity with phone nearby with cellular connected
14309,hi robert if you have your non cellular watch nearby your phone it will use it wifi connection or cellular
14310,such a helpful film
14311,thanks
14312,i love apple watch i am obsessed with them but unfortunately i have never owned one dion today mark the beginning of the apple watch prep you told me to watch out for february 18th and i did i am so excited i can not wait for the giveaway i pray i win this time
14313,dion schuddeboom thanks dion then in this case i wish myself the best of luck
14314,hi immanuella thanks for taking part again praying help but so doe luck in this case
14315,i have used the third party sport band from amazon with great success
14316,i want to ask i have an apple watch se2 with rough edge and a bit sharp but not on all edge is that normal
14317,this doe not sound normal
14318,hi doe the non cellular track your run without having your phone with you thank you
14319,hi sudhan yes it will stil track the data
14320,are you left handed
14321,dion schuddeboom i am left handed and have been wearing watch on my left hand since forever i got the wash and put it on left again like i always did then i wa checking setting and saw how i can make it work on my right hand crazy thanks for the video
14322,yes
14323,i went into my local apple store thinking i would be choosing the darker colour but wa unsure of the size after trying out all the colour size model i surprised myself because i preferred the lighter colour i actually went for the series 7 41 nike it is my first apple watch and i will hopefully be keeping it for a few year
14324,enjoy
14325,it is unbelievable but i still use the apple watch series 2 every day the only thing complaining about is the battery that on day when i go to the gym when i get home around 7 30 pm i need to charge it right away otherwise it work perfectly
14326,dion schuddeboom yes it still work 100percent maybe late this year i buy a new one i have this serie 2 since may 2018
14327,great to hear all function are still 100percent
14328,i can not believe people do not put screen protector on phone and watch you can get a glass protector for that watch for like dollar7 dude i know you got one but day 1 it should go on and help resale value
14329,i guess i hold a different perspective when it come to getting the cellular v the non cellular to me it is like buying an insurance given the cost difference to be pretty small and of course paying a small monthly fee to use the cellular service a well a for why i look at it a buying an insurance is because during unexpected situation where you suddenly lost your phone you can still remain contactable to your loved one another use case scenario would be for runner and swimmer where it is inconvenient or your phone will be inaccessible when you are doing these activity the cellular version give you the opportunity to take call message while your phone is lying inside the locker or at your home oh and those occasion where your phone dy because you forgot or do not have a power bank around your watch becomes your backup plan
14330,with increased risk of theft size and weight of newer iphones i am 50 50 on carrying my phone when out and about many time the apple watch is all i need
14331,hi constance thanks for sharing your point of view interesting and useful and might change some user to change
14332,not even a full 2 minute into the video and you are asking for like and sub if you are enjoying this video so far what am i meant to be enjoying by now nothing is happened yet
14333,hi logan you are right but that is a bit how we content creator do this i still hope you enjoyed my video in the end anyhow thanks for watching
14334,sir always on display come in se2 any future update
14335,do not expect it
14336,it is unnecessary

14338,here in my country it 316dollar
14339,that hurt price indeed differ a lot
14340,i am thinking of getting this watch have never been an apple watch owner i am 58 and not very tech savy so i really appreciate your video and instruction thank you cheer from canada
14341,good evening i think that one can enjoy all this watch brings without being tech savvy a quality that is not related to age imho when you buy it enjoy it
14342,i do not understand having always on display on a watch i do not need the screen on when i am not looking at it just drain battery more i would think
14343,i got apple watch se2 a my first apple watch and i have a i phone 13 i am very happy with my purchase and it is very satisfying to use and seamlessly compatible which is apple known for
14344,i thought that the crown should be towards the upper side and not the below side
14345,hi manan most people do it like that but it is just the way i like it
14346,here in germany the apple watch se 2 currently cost 299euros the apple watch 7 is available for at least 399euros and the 8 currently cost 499euros so is the series 7 worth the 100 buck more than the se 2 or should i get the se 2 i would use it mainly for workout and walk
14347,hi tala aod is very personal i do not want a watch without it others prefer without aod the functionality of the se2 in itself is great
14348,dion schuddeboom is the aod really that important for what is it my colleague said i need to watch my heart rate while working out because of the effectiveness
14349,se2 should do the trick only no aod
14350,please get the cellular one it is way better trust me it is worth the extra money
14351,in my opinion only in some case
14352,i like being phone le so a cellular smartwatch is much more convenient for me and because i do not like the bulk in my pocket so yeah basically a cellular plan for the apple watch to me personally is worth it
14353,thanks for sharing your pov
14354,zzzzzz people are buying that
14355,the way he wear them it hurt my eye
14356,hi daniel sunglass help
14357,the se and se2 are ideal for anyone who is not intense exercise focussed older people professional student perfect if you really want to log and track workout and any heavy duty sport or activity then the other one have feature you may appreciate
14358,can you care to elaborate what are those other feature that others have and not the se2 coz i had garmin vivoactive 4 and not in the slightest i miss it now with the iwatch se2 oh and the garmin wa all over the place in the pool sometimes overcounting by 4 5 time the lap and everything wa a mess
14359,do you think that the midnight is more navy blue than black i am looking to get one but am not a fan of navy blue
14360,hi jessica extremely difficult to say depends a lot on the way how the light shine on the phone but all in all i would say a bit more blue than black
14361,thanks for another honest review video
14362,the se doe a great job for dollar240 for me workout tracker and sleep tracker money well spent
14363,your video are incredible i have had my se2 44mm for a few week now and love watching your content
14364,thank you ben enjoy your se2
14365,i am sad that 38 mm version is gone from apple watch i am a woman and even 40 mm look kinda big and have that rap overstatment big watch
14366,hi josipa i agree that it is pity that no smaller version are available
14367,i have iphone x max that mean i can not unlock my phone whenever i am outside while wearing a face mask so my question are will apple watch se 2 be able to unlock my phone while i am outside wearing mask will it able to use with my banking apps any apps that use faceid to unlock
14368,hi question 1 is yes question 2 perhaps depends on the app
14369,just get an apple watch 4 you can find them for like dollar100
14370,you are aware that apple colluded in china to hogtie protestors making it impossible for the general public to air drop the only mean people had of bypassing censorship a dollar for apple is a dollar for evil
14371,dion schuddeboom i am no5 big into cancel culture but in this case i would stand firm maybe do not support them with future video
14372,hi julia i am aware of the underlying issue
14373,thanks for this review i have the same and am so happy sir may i ask you what kind of protector is on your watch something tels me yours is good quality thanks
14374,hi good question i have done a video on this issue but a i test also the durability of the watch i do not use a screen protector in order to be able to share the result with you
14375,this is just what i need do not want to spend the dollar500 for the series 8 yet i do want to upgrade from my series 3 which would be perfect to use with my iphone 13 that i am not planning to upgrade from for at least 2 3 year from now
14376,i actually got it a my 2nd apple watch my friend had given me his 3rd gen and i upgraded to this and i love it do not see any real reason to pay for a series 8 or whatever
14377,enjoy
14378,the battery is very terrible
14379,dion schuddeboom yes unlike my huawei watch can make it 7days with a single charge with aod
14380,it take me through the whole day in general one recharge per 24 hr
14381,i bought the 44mm apple watch se 2 with cellular i used my amazon gift card that i received during christmas it is great for when i step out for a run and i do not need to bring my phone with me every time the cellular service is really not that much it is an dollar5 a month on top of my cell phone plan but a you mentioned if someone is taking their phone with them everywhere it is not necessary i do not always take my phone with me so this wa a big plus for me
14382,clear
14383,me who bought the se1 6mos before se2 released
14384,ai happens also to me in the past enjoy it for a year or so and then trade it for a later model
14385,it is been several year that i have an apple watch s1 and s5 now am i the only one that want to just stop this apple watch is well first of all last a day of battery if you sleep with it and use it all day long and do one exercise the battery isn t there at all and the super hyper connectivity is way too much and i think that i am just gon na go for a garmin 255 that track my health and that is it and last at least 10 to 15 day of battery
14386,hi peter do not say sorry i like feedback and opinion i learn from it
14387,dion schuddeboom i mean this is just personal not to include everyone in the same basket it wa really said sorry for that if it is it wa a really good video by the eay
14388,hi peter you are for sure not the only one probably a minority but each his her own the large majority including myself are rather happy with this apple watch set up and connectivity
14389,doe he have the watch upside down or have i always used mine upside down this is kinda freaking me out lol
14390,dion schuddeboom ok phew heck no do not change it i wa just worried i wa doing it wrong
14391,ha ha no it is just the way i like to wear it quite some people make comment about it sorry about that but i will probably not change it
14392,lol sorry it is a serious question is it because you are in the uk or is it because you are left handed and wear it in the right hand i am very curious now
14393,the se2 44mm gps version apple watch is my first and i could say it is worth it a i am having a great experience using it
14394,need to know the battery percentage
14395,se 2 ha no fast charging like series 8 still it charge fast enough i charge in the morning 25percent to 80percent 45 min which last me to the next morning
14396,wanted the ultra for it siren feature but cost way to much
14397,hi charles yes it is on the expensive side
14398,i had the apple watch se upgraded to se 2 just cause found out it had crash detection so gave my old watch to daughter
14399,i got the se2 about a month ago i have loved it so far in term of battery life and it is other cool feature however i am extremely disappointed in it build strength while trying to find a case for the device that i liked i got a crack on the screen from what i would call very normal every day contact did not even know it happened until the morning after never had a moment where i thought it could have happened so my first watch i ever got is already broken before even getting a month out of it it is still usable because it is just a small crack but it cover just enough of the screen to be annoying just can not believe in 2023 we still need extreme protection on device that cost hinders of dollar
14400,got the se2 44mm for christmas first time apple watch user this is beyond expectation from imessage answering call home integration sleep tracking and so on also a great video a always
14401,thank you and enjoy the se2
14402,got mine may first
14403,congrats and enjoy
14404,i put on a tempered glass protector not long after i got mine it wa one you recommended on another video or very similar work great so far and make me le stressed about any major scratch added bonus the squarer shape of the cover make it look like an ultra model
14405,which tempered glass are you using
14406,hi stuart thanks for the feedback
14407,moved from android to apple mostly because i wanted an apple watch a they are known to be much more accurate than android equivalent no regret so far loving the apple ecosystem and 3 day into owning the se 2 and could not be happier using mine mostly for fitness not sure what the 8 could offer that would ever sway me away from the se range it doe everything i want and for a decent price great video
14408,dank meme i have not tried the watch 8 unfortunately so can not really give you the best advice from my understanding the 8 doe have some additional monitoring feature such a ecg and temperature however the review i read mostly suggested that those are thing you may only use once in a while and the se2 still ha the core monitor that are most useful for everyday use for running the se2 ha been very accurate for me i am happy with my se2 so far and i think the value for money is fantastic if budget is no issue for you though then maybe go with the series 8 for the slightly larger screen extra you will be happy with either imo
14409,hey stuart i am seriously confused about choosing se 2 or watch 8 a there ton of health feature over se2 i am just looking at a watch for running predominantly
14410,enjoy your se 2
14411,lemmie clap them
14412,i got myself an apple watch after buying my wife one for christmas it is been a life changer make sure i close my ring everyday feel much healthier
14413,bought an se 2 from a private seller for dollar250 u and being my first apple watch i just love it it actually restrain my need to grab my iphone more often especially while i am working
14414,i have the same size look awesome
14415,happy with my se2 purchase
14416,hi ina i am sure you will enjoy it
14417,i upgraded from the series 2 to the se2 same color and band it is been great
14418,i went from an se to se2 and it is definitely an upgrade best is battery life but i also love how the screen area is bigger and the shape is more smooth unless you need an ekg or aod it is the perfect watch at a really nice price i got the succulent band but do also have darker band to swap out thank you for your thought a always
14419,jacky is bintrust me it will not make it i use my apple watch heavily and right now the battery is not doing too hot this wa before they finally added low battery i totally recommend using low battery even though the battery is 89percent it save the battery but my watch go to 10percent in just 9 hour with very heavy use
14420,adrianna norwood i bought a used se 1 4 day ago actually arrived 2 day ago and though apple say up to 18 hour and the battery health on this thing is 89percent it definitely not living up to the standard i think it might be 18 hour with like light use but idk i do not see this thing making it past 10 or 11 without low battery mode
14421,jacky is bin i have the first gen se i had it since it came out and the battery life suck i wish they had low power mode way earlier on the se but i have to hurry and upgrade soon because my battery is getting worse
14422,evan maybe they used the se 1 for a while and the battery health got worse idk though it should have been similar
14423,from the se to se2 the screen and battery life is exactly the same
14424,i got my se 2 last week because of your first video recommendation for a first time apple watch user thanks i am enjoying it very much

14447,hi balint you are right concerning the glass the only exception is the stainless steel version that ha the more scratch resistance glass a ha the ultra
14448,first time user of the apple watch and i am loving it paying became a breeze and is my favourite function unlocking my intel imac and macbook and even my 1password manager is a close second furthermore shopping card scanning 3rd party app sleep and of course sport tracking is great too last but not least notification and simply checking the time weather etc all in all a happy user oh and by the way my apple watch last a day and a night and in the morning i still have between 50percent and 60percent battery left throwing it on the charger in the morning for an hour is more than enough to last another day so battery life is good too
14449,lars hofman i love the battery life too the first se did not last a day

14495,i do not think the scratch on the screen is something that happens only to the se 2 since it is the same display a on series 8
14496,do you have a screen protector that you can recommend
14497,this one might help
14498,he already addressed this if you were listening said he ha an entire video about that

14500,can i bye 2023 apple watch se 1st gen
14501,se is a great watch nice video dion
14502,thanks steven
14503,i got the se2 several month ago my first apple watch did not realize what i wa missing the activity ring and exercise tracking is what i definitely use the most been a game changer for me especially now that i am well over the hill approaching 43 year old
14504,shahila nathan afaik every apple watch except for the ultra you should expect to charge it daily it not really a hassle though even though mine doesnt have fast charging
14505,do you find you have to charge it daily
14506,43 is still young let is not offend the above 60 age group
14507,the se2 is my first apple watch a well and i like it too but what you are saying doe not make very much sense to me because i triple the ring objective every day just by living it doe not register sh t during my weight training i need to use a separate app for that so unless you do not leave the bed or sofa for the entire day the watch act like you are a top athlete just for going along the day the ring add no value what so ever for me personally
14508,damn

14517,muddy water it doe not because it is using the wifi
0,"I never thought I would need an Apple Watch; however, after getting one I have been so impressed.  It not only keeps great time, but it helps monitor my sleep and keeps track of my steps and workouts. It has also helped me locate my phone several times since I always seem to misplace it!!  I did have to change the rubber band that came with it, but I love the new leather one.  A great purchase."
1,The listing was spot on! there are a few minor scratches to the screen. They are minor enough where a finger nail does not grab the scratches. The rest of the watch seems to be perfect! I tested the Oxygen sensor and BPM compared to a  medical unit I have and its within 1-2% accuracy. Definitely recommend this seller for posting accurate details about an item.
2,"I will admitted I was a little scriptable about purchasing the apple watch, but was glad that I take that chance once I received it. Since I’ve had it I haven’t had any problems with it and the battery life on the watch is wonderful. I would say take your chances on purchasing this item if it’s something you would really like."
3,I ordered this Watch in excellent like new condition and it is! Works perfectly. Arrived with 80% on the battery life. Charges to 100% with no issue and lasts me 1.5 days. Screen is flawless back is flawless. Great buy! So much cheaper then buying from Apple directly.
4,"I was mostly concerned with the battery life. Thankfully, I received mine at 94%. I bought it in good condition. It has minor scratches. I must say it was a fantastic buy! I recommend to anyone. Everything seems fully functional so far, and I can easily use it on a daily basis. I highly recommend guys."
5,For now battery life is good but  some time must go on before verifying if remains like that for enough time.
6,"Product looks flawless,battery is at 85% but still goes all day without having to charge."
7,Love it great upgrade from a 3
8,"Was used which is fine, for the price you can’t beat it. Everything works as expected, small scratch on side but not too noticeable. Would recommend this purchase. After pairing with phone watch works great no complaints."
9,I took a chance and purchased this refurbished Apple Watch Series 6. The watch to date has worked perfectly with no visible flaws.
10,
11,"I got this watch in a weird packaging & it was at 83% from their highest condition.Even though it’s a competitive price for a watch like this & I like the features the watch series 6 came in.The battery life came not in perfect.It’s a gamble with this company.Replacing it at Apple is about $79.For now I’m going to keep it since, it’s not defeated yet."
12,Got this as a gift for my daughter she absolutely loves it!
13,
14,Mine operates and looks perfect.
15,"Received product and shipping was quick. I’ve had it for a week, and thus far I truly love it!!!!!"
16,Item was just as described. Purchased an excellent condition watch and it arrived quickly and has 89% battery life.
17,"I’ve only had the watch actually on and working for maybe 30 minutes now but I did receive it in great cosmetic condition. It came in a generic box with the watch, band, and charger (no box to plug into wall). There are no scratches and the band is new. The battery wasn’t charged and it did take 2.5 hours to get fully charged. I didn’t realize my phone didn’t have the latest iOS (16) so I did have to update my phone and that was annoying but not the sellers fault by any means. I am annoyed that I couldn’t choose the band size because the one that was sent is way too big and I’ll have to buy a new one as I didn’t see where I could contact the seller about this. I’ll update this review after I’ve had the watch for a while."
18,"It came as the expected size, but as I went to pair the watch to my phone it’s still under someone else’s iCloud and the only way I can set up my watch is if the original owner removes the watch from their account and I have no clue who it is so I’m gonna have to return it"
19,Came quickly and as described! Works great
20,"Well, I’d like to say I’m happy but I’m not. Bought a new (refurbished) Apple Watch 6 and here’s how it arrived…with the dreaded red snake of death. And I can’t get it to charge. Now according to YT, this is a fairly common issue that is fixable with an easy home hack so let me give it a chance and try this home remedy and then I’ll update this rating accordingly. But for now…I’m not a very satisfied customer. When you spend a couple hundred $$$ on a new (refurbished) product (esp an Apple product) you shouldn’t have to jump through special hoops just to get it to work right.Update: Ok well, the hack worked and my watch is up and running so that’s a plus. But like I said before, when you drop a couple hundred bucks on a new product, you expect it to work right out of the box. If I hadn’t looked up that hack, I would’ve returned the watch and been a dissatisfied customer with a pretty negative rating."
21,"I wish I had images- I would have if they had not readily accepted my request to return they day it arrived. This product is advertised as excellent condition- it could not be further from that. To begin, a came with some minor scratches- okay, that's not too big a deal, I'm gonna buy a case for it anyway. Then, as I am setting up the watch , I notice that the screen physically moves into the watch as I press buttons. It was pretty dark in my room, so I turn on the lights, take a closer look and it appears that either A) The screen had come off and they had tried to glue it back together with the equivalent of elementary Elmer's glue OR B) The Apple Watch adhesive had been extremely used and worn out- to the point where the adhesive was ""leaking"" over the edges of the screen- something fatal they failed to inspect. I am almost sure it is the former given that the adhesive seems it was applied as the real apple watch adhesive is located inside the lining of the screen rather than on its outside edges. Obviously, this scenario is far worse and demonstrates the carelessness of this company. This I presume would be a major compromise of the waterproof aspect of the watch as under the screen, all of the mechanics are exposed to the elements. Cases are often not waterproof either for the Apple Watch since the watch itself is already waterproof, so that would not fix the issue. Now, I did request to refund the day of, reporting the exact issue, and wow! They accepted! Happy Ending! Not quite.As you might expect, the customer service was not great either.I will admit that I physically returned it a few weeks after- I was terribly busy and this apple watch that I was already promised a refund for was not at the top of my list of concerns. By the way- the deadline was in late December. I had returned it in the first third of the time they wanted it back. Fast-forward, and I see that they had charged me a ""restocking fee"" of HALF OF PRICE OF THE WATCH. I payed $270 for this ""excellent condition"" device only to be dealt a hole of $135 in the wallet. I was essentially paying to repair the watch, and for them to sell it to another poor soul. The cost to actually repair it is much cheaper by the way, and you could probably do a better job. Nowhere do they mention a restocking fee, especialIy not such a large one. I, obviously angry, had to control myself when talking to their customer service- which was hardly a service and more of an insult. I asked for a full refund in what one would consider polite given the circumstances. Here's the kicker. They had the AUDACITY to claim that I, MYSELF, had broken it because it was not returned immediately after receival. Don't be mistaken, they would likely come up with another excuse to only refund you half of your money even if you returned it earlier than myself. The apple watch was not used a single day after my initial complaint, yet the customer service had the incredible nerve to claim that it was my fault. They somehow believe that I had bought the watch, and planned to break and return it. They genuinely believe that somebody would buy the watch and report damage the day after so that they could use it for a month, THEN break it in the exact way as described, THEN return it. Not even a legitimate scammer would plan that- logically, its just not cost efficient, practical, or useful. The customer service was vague and almost condescending.Just because they have some sort of Amazon Renewed Certification does not mean it will be anywhere close to ""like new"" or excellent folks. You would think that for a company selling the same items tagged in progressively ascending order of quality (They have the same watch at different prices for ""good"" ""Very Good"" and ""Excellent"") would have an at least decent ""Excellent"" option. What an absolute joke and a horrible experience to ruin my week.Just don't risk it. Heads you get an overpriced used Apple Watch. Tails, you dig yourself a $135 hole."
22,I love it! it's my first time to order at Amazon Renewed and I was surprised. I didn't expect much but it is like brand new. even the box that came with it looks new. The watch has 0 scratches. Battery life is very good too. Two thumbs up to the seller!
23,"Bought 4 of these watches.  All of them were cosmetically and functionally perfect.  One watch face started separating a week after christmas.  Seller refunded with no problems, i ordered replacement."
24,I like it very much. It does everything I need and more. Yes I am very happy with my watch.
25,Upgraded from series 3 and I’m glad I did. The shipping was very fast. The watch looks brand new with no scratches. Works just like it should so far. Very happy with this watch.
26,"Long story, but the price of a refurbished Apple 6 Watch was just as much as the Fi… that I returned that was a Christmas gift that didn’t even come close to having all the functions. The battery life is great; I was worried at first, but after each full day of wearing it and playing with it, by bedtime it is usually down between 68% - 64%. It works as describes, connected easy to my phone, and looks great. I don’t wear watches or jewelry to bed so I haven use the the sleep tracking. I’m trying to talk my brother into one from the same suppler. Very happy with it."
27,"I am trying to buy this for a 3rd time, only because after some looking it seems that each time I have got this it has been from a different seller. The first time the sensor on the back of the watch was cracked really bad, which I'm sure would have voided any waterproof-ness. The second time, my husband synced it and wore it for a day and a half and a bubble had formed in the bottom of the screen. I thought it was the protector that I put on it, but surely enough it was in the actual screen! It felt like it wasn't as flush as it should have been from the get go, but I was blaming it on probably not being the original screen so it wasn't going to feel as perfect as if it were. It also had some dirt/makeup caked in the holes, which I thought was gross and could have been cleaned better.Either way, I am now trying to purchase it for a 3rd time, hopefully 3rd times a charm since they are supposed to be ""excellent"" condition! But if you are going to try for it I would definitely inspect it well before doing too much with it."
28,Arrived quick with a charger.  Was DOA but after it was charged it was good to go.  Had surface scratches on screen even though listed in excellent condition.  Battery health was at 81%.  Satisfied with purchase based on what I paid
29,great watch for everyday use
30,"Shipping was fast, I was scared I’d get one of the broken ones but it was in literally pristine condition, no scratches anywhereIt did come in generic packaging with a generic Watch band, but everything else checks out"
31,
32,"I realize this is a refurbished watch, however the battery life when I received it was already poor, and it only lasts a couple of hours on a full charge. There were chips and scratches on the exterior of the watch, and it certainly wasn’t in “excellent” condition as described. Hoping they send me a refund so I can get something different."
33,"Its the watch I ordered, It works, and Im happy."
34,This was my first Apple Watch that I bought and I like it the only problem I have with the watch is that at times when I look at my Watch to see my notifications I’m trying to pull down the notifications or pull up the controls but I can’t. I can push on the button and move the screen around but if I go to the front screen I still can’t pull down the notifications so I have to reset my watch in order to work again and so far it has happen three times since I got it. Overall i like it!
35,"this product came as informed. I bought used and it works great. it had one minor scratch on the screen but it was just a matter of time before i did that anyway. no problems with it at all. it functions perfectly. will buy again this way if needed, but hopefully not for a long long time.yes I was a bit nervous about buying a used or refurbished product, but my last one I actually bought was brand new from apple and they hosed me only lasted 8 months series 3se. so I tried this route and so far so good.best of luck"
36,My wife love her apple watch.
37,It came really fast. The charger came with a normal usb plug in so I can hook it into anything I want. Shipping was super fast. It is practically brand new. Couldn’t tell it was a referb. Battery life is at 95% and not a single scratch. I’m beyond happy with my purchase and the shipping.
38,The first refurbished item I have ever bought. It is working as expected. It is working great. I would recommend to a friends.
39,Lucky I had a extra charging cable disk or I would have sent back.
40,Side button did not work. Description said excellent condition but was scratched and nicked all over front and sides of watch. Sending back for a refund. Will update on that process.  They refunded purchase in full. It didn't take long.
41,"Thought I'd try an Apple Watch, but didn't want to buy new. This watch arrived well packaged, looks brand new, and works flawlessly. Happy with my first Apple Watch purchase."
42,I’ve Apple watches for years. I’m still getting acquainted with some of the new features. Can’t tell it from a brand new watch.
43,"I am extremely happy with this purchase. Perfect condition, 100% battery life, and a great value. I would highly recommend."
44,I like it for the medical stuff
45,It only had a tiny little mark on the outside corner.  The face was in perfect condition. It is a beautiful watch.This was a great buy and shipped quick.
46,Great battery life. Great price
47,"I had a Fitbit Ionic which i loved. I got a recall on it from Amazon due to some battery exploding issues, so i picked this as the replacement and it hasnt let me down. I was only able to get a used one as a replacement though so i dont believe the battery life is good as it should be, but otherwise the device is pretty amazing."
48,"Good value for money. Love the watch. Bought “Excellent refurbished “ which is supposed to have a perfect screen, but had one small nick at the top.  Still love the watch. My first Apple Watch.  Will keep."
49,Didn't come in an original apple box or an original apple watch band. There were some scratches on my screen and the battery health for the watch is at 97% maximum capacity on delivery.
50,It works me as excellent. Battery needs be charged at least once every 24 hours.
51,the sim removable tool didn't came with the product as announced.
52,Battery life sucks but you get what you pay for
53,It a working watch that I bought in “excellent condition” but when I took off the screen protector it revealed the scratches they tried to cover up
54,Works great nice watch
55,"I upgraded from Gen 2 watch and big difference. Not just the size but over all performance and features. Basically after some research why spend the $$ on the latest 7 model when this 6 model does the same thing. Battery is great all day use even with the always on display from 0700 to 2300 no problems, when I turned off the always on display I had more battery still left over.  Now with the 8 model to be release and only add on feather is a temp check, no sir this is the way to go!"
56,"I charge it every night, but I believe that 48 hours would be possible from each charge. The difference between the 45mm for Series 7, and 44mm for this Series 6, is truly not noticeable to me. The watch body arrived in AS NEW condition, in the box it had originally, and with a renewed standard band that I refused to put on the body. I had ordered a heavy stainless band for the watch, and it fit perfectly, and made the watch feel normal on my wrist. I’m frankly using apps on this watch, that I never thought I would, for health, wellness, mindfulness, and activity. I love this Series 6, and the price vs. a Series 7 makes it truly a bargain. Buy one!"
57,"Not really complaining, just being honest. Came with a pretty deep and good size scratch across the screen. Had a cheap screen protector on it which hid the scratch pretty well until removed. Definitely a bummer. However, works just fine. Battery seems to be functioning properly, along with all other functions. For the price, the scratch doesn’t necessarily bother me too much. Over all not a bad deal. If anything changes in the next few weeks I’ll edit the review"
58,"When I got the watch I checked it over, the seals on the outside of the screen were raised (a sign of a cheap screen replacement) along with that the screen itself was plastic, not tempered glass as it should be. Also the max battery life is 80%"
59,"I love it!! Came on time, no scratches, came with charger, wrist band and everything!! Looks brand new. It wasn’t charged when I got it, but after being charged it’s working great!! I highly recommend!!"
60,Excelente y lo mejor
61,"The product came as advertised!!Shipping was good and on time.. the battery life seems to be kinda short, I can run it through out the day, and by the night when am ready for sleep, it’s still going with about 35%…so not to bad !"
62,Very nice watch!!!  We didn't realize we purchase a refurbished but decided to keep it and it's working just like new.  We are satisfied.
63,good value
64,The watch was purchased to help me maintain a healthy lifestyle.
65,"Even though it is used, it works great, only some scratches in the crown, battery came at 97% and with a non-Apple charger, I had to bought one to increase the battery performance."
66,"I finally upgraded. I rarely pay retail for things and I don't mind last year's model. I was not disappointed with this I-Watch. It performs and does everything Apple claims it does. However, I'm in my late 50's not my late teens, the green, black and red band is not cool. Don't get fancy, just provide a plain black band in the future."
67,"It is perfect small scratches, buy shield guard n it’s looks brand new out of the box! Ty for my upgraded (new) iwatch"
68,"I got the watch with an off brand charger, usb cord, and it came in a white box unprotected. The back of the watch, on the sensor was COVERED in a sticky substance which took forever to clean. Kind of disappointed for the money I paid for a ""like new"" hopefully refurbished watch."
69,was a little skeptical at first but as soon as i got it on i knew it was the real thing!! love love love this watch!! worth the price!!!!
70,"Watch was in perfect shape, connected no problem, and very happy with this upgrade from my Apple Watch 3"
71,"paired with phone very easily, but short battery life. had to return but other than battery issues nice watch"
72,Just had for a few days but so far in happy with it
73,Perfect!
74,I absolutely love my watch and I am beyond happy with my purchase.  I'm going to buy one for my sister!
75,"The Watch is absolutely amazing!!! Thank you, I love it"
76,"A refurbished Apple Watch. The screen is perfect, no cosmetic damages on the whole watch. It does come in aftermarket packing, which I assume is because it’s refurbished but it’s exactly as described. Ran the serial number to double check and it was a certified apple product. Well worth it. :)"
77,Have to write a review or can’t post itIt is a Apple Watch looked and so far has functioned as new oneUpdate still looking great and going strong if you like apple watches it was a great deal
78,Intermittently will not charge and intermittently does not receive text or phone calls verdict is still out but leaning towards returning after spending $291
79,"I like it because m, it helps me a lot with my health progress."
80,"I was hesitant to purchase this too good to be true item, but happy to report it was Perfect.  Exactly as described all buttons and touch screen functions work perfectly!  Super great item, even better price and arrived in very short amount of time!! Will do business again!!!"
81,A gift
82,Great value at a good price!
83,Very nifty gadget to carry through my day. Up at 5am to start my charge only taking about 40mins (battery still left over from previous day) and will last me through the night. Allows me to complete my day with the convenience of a glance at the watch and quick talk to text response. Great for someone who likes the modern convenience with a classic customizable interface.
84,My watch didn’t come in Apple packaging but that’s to be expected buying refurbished. The screen was free of scratches and it’s performed incredibly well for me. Would purchase over and over!
85,Cool watch.I like it.Apple software could use some tweaks though.
86,Pretty sizable and noticeable scratch on watch face.  Was not supposed to have that. Otherwise it works really well.
87,"The one I received is basically like new. No issues and works great. Just make sure to leave it on the charger for like 30 minutes right when you get it. Mine was super dead on arrival and I thought it might have been broken. Nope, just drained. It works like a peach."
88,Although the watch was fine the watch band was defective.  I am purchasing another band and hoped amazon would have reimbursed me just for the band I need to buy.  Amazon needs to check their products more efficiently
89,The health battery was not in good condition.
90,
91,The only issue I had with receiving the watch is that the charger it came with didn’t work so I had to buy a new one:( other than that the watch is amazing!!
92,"This is a high quality used item, with a battery capacity of 94%, so pretty good. However I am extremely disappointed that the charging cable, wall charger, and watch band are after market brands of questionable quality (a new, current-gen Apple Watch comes with Apple accessories, so the worth of the savings here is questionable)."
93,The watch is everything it’s supposed to be all functions work great! I couldn’t more satisfied!
94,"The watch look and seemed brand new. If you're looking for an electronic product, you should definitely shop with these guys!"
95,
96,It was the wrong color I wanted space gray and they sent blue but it still looks OK and well it has a few scratches that are kind of minor on the screen but I mean it’ll do for the price and refurbished it works fine too so yea for the price its alright
97,Just like new!
98,Came real fast and started right up. It was very easy to set up. There was no visible damage or scratches etc. It looks and runs just like it came right from the Apple Store.
99,"I was a bit nervous about the refurb, and it being a day late didn’t help. BUT it arrived in pristine condition—original box, two band sizes, charging cable and a blemish-free watch with 100% battery life!! VERY SATISFIED!"
100,"I was a little skeptical, but it was worth it. It was just a little late coming in mail."
101,Product was just as described
102,Comes in sketch packaging and the ONLY directions in the box are how to return them?!? Like they know they are faulty is the message I got!! It arrives fully dead and tried charging it and got the green screen of death for 48 hours nothing charged no change. Tried draining the battery completely and still same faulty battery. I was skeptical and now I will only buy new!Save your money and time and just get one that actually works!
103,The watch is very uncomfortable with the band that comes with it. I think it was pricey and a few times the battery life was not the best.
104,I was pleased with the ease of purchase and delivery.  item is exactly as described.  I would recommend and I would purchase from seller again.
105,My wife loves her watch it was a great buy for the price.
106,The watch was in great condition and was exactly what I wanted for much less than a new one.
107,"The fall detection goes off nonstop, even while you sit in a chair. I never even got to try the sleep tracking because the watch is so bright even when you lower the brightness. I couldn’t sleep with all that light. The big issue really was the fall detection since it calls 911 and would do it multiple times a day. I had to return the watch it was so bad. Everything else was great though it just wasn’t worth it."
108,"I was reluctant on purchasing a renewed Apple Watch, but glad I did now.  The watch looks flawless, and the battery life is very strong.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
109,"Watch came with display screen not flush with the rest of the watch, within days it had air bubbles forming under the screen. I went ahead and returned it and about a week and a half after receiving it thinking I would get a refund. They only refunded me $63 of the $242 that I paid. Upon further investigation they charged me for $179 for them to fix the watch to be able to sell it to the next person. Worst Amazon experience I’ve ever had."
110,Charger failed after only two months of use. Was hardly moved around.
111,"After just a month, bubbles developed on the screen of the watch.  At that point, I started the process to return the watch.  I received an email with a full page of instructions including requiring five photos of the watch including the sides (?) of the watch.  I think this is done to make the return process so complicated that you will give up on returning the watch, which I ultimately did."
112,"This watch is just like new, easy to set up. No problems."
113,"Watch was pretty much like new. Came with original box, 2 bands, charging cord, and manuals. Very satisfied with this purchase."
114,This watch does everything you would want from a smart watch. Great value for the money.
115,Nice watch
116,I really like all the health features being able to be in sync and integrated.
117,Watch was just as described. Everything on it seems to be working great .definitely would recommend !!
118,Like phone answer and Siri
119,Amazing condition for a refurbished. Thank you very much.
120,I bought apple watch series 6 but i got very old one battery percentage 88. And also chargers are not apple something local brands i didn’t expect this from amazon US now am going to india i cant return this. Dont buy from this sellers.
121,Very impressed. The item was really well packaged and practically looked new.
122,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift and luckily I checked it because it doesn’t work! I went through the whole set up TWICE and the scroll button doesn’t work at all. Do not buy from this seller!!!! The seller said it was in excellent condition but obviously they don’t check their products because it was 100% broken when I received it. The package it came in was not damaged at all and it was not left on the porch… I picked it up immediately all just to be disappointed. Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS SELLER."
123,"The blood oxygen, pulse, and heart rate sensors are very helpful."
124,"“Refurbished” Items are supposed to work, screen came separated from the device, battery will last 3 hours on low power mode. Contacted seller and he was rude on top of the broken device. If you buy you will have to deal with attitude and defective items."
125,Did not know it was refurbished but works good
126,Fast deliveryProduct in great shapeOverall very pleased
127,works like brand new
128,This watch is fake. does not charge and not compatible with apple app.
129,Need I say more it’s an Apple Watch great functionality.
130,"I have owned both the 40 and 44mm Apple Watch now and I have to say, the 44mm is much easier to read and use than the 40mm.  I love this watch!"
131,Once I received be watch I charged it for almost 24 hours and it still won’t come on. I have tried everything to fix it through apple and still nothing!
132,"Bought an apple watch in October. The listing stated that the watch was in excellent condition . when the watch arrived I inspected it, everything seemed fine. then i noticed that the watch band was not from APPLE and had a screen proctor over it didnt think much of it at the time. recently, the screen started to get moisture under it so i decided to remove it only to find the actual screen full of scratches. JUST BUY NEW WATCH!!"
133,"I received my product on time, perfect. Only the charging cable could be original, but it works perfectly."
134,This package showed up a day earlier than I expected it.  I opened up the box and the watch does not look renewed - it is like new quality.  Will absolutely buy from this merchant again.
135,Like new !
136,Arrives in tine and with no problems.The product is in perfect conditions
137,Let me know watch it came early I’m very happy to get you one
138,Good
139,I love it
140,"I was so excited to have an Apple Watch again, but the back sensor portion arrived cracked.Now I’m paying for shipping to return lol, awesome.Not sure how something can be sold and labeled as “excellent” condition if there’s a crack in it?Very disappointed."
141,I have only had this renewed watch for one week but it has worked and looks as if it were brand new!
142,"Have owned dozens of Apple products, but this was the first I bought renewed/used. Watch arrived with a dead battery, was an ominous sign. When it was finally charged, I tried pairing with my phone, but the watchOS continually rebooted during the process, took me three hours to get it synced the first time. Throughout the day, the phone would reboot every five minutes. Went to Apple support and tried all their fixes—unpair/repair, hard reset, software update, Etc. nothing worked. Packed it up that night and sent it back the next day."
143,Too much worn and.  And not exactly as per description. Better go for NEW
144,Works well. Great value … No issues! Ordered some watch bands off amazon and they worked well too.
145,"Good value, I like being able to look at notifications without having to pull my phone every time."
146,My son was
147,"Perfect condition, even came nicely sealed and taped up in its original apple box. I appreciate it."
148,"I bought this as a gift expecting it to be in good condition, but the screen was coming apart from the rest of the watch. Plus the battery life isn’t as good as another refurbished watch I’ve bought. Will be returning, and they won’t pay for the return costs. Lol."
149,Swimming tracking was almost 50% off and I feel the weight lifting isn’t accurate based on effort and increasing weight levels.
150,"Watch arrived dirty, but other than that it works as expected"
151,The series 6 watch is amazing. The watch I actually got is not what I expected. The Renewed products are supposed to be in like new condition. The one I got was from the seller woot. It was clearly used and in fair condition. Had scratches on the screen and the body of the watch. It also came with a aftermarket band not the Apple band . I wish I would have bought a new one. I not going to try to return it because I bought it on a gift card and I don’t want to bother but don’t expect a open box or Apple refurb quality watch on this listing.
152,The watch is refurbished and it said that it would be in great condition. The watch doesn’t work. The watch randomly turns off and doesn’t turn back on. That battery life is horrible it dies when it gets to 60%. I am very disappointed and i wasted my money. Do not get this product. Thank you
153,"I received my watch with scratches on the uppermost part of the screen. I figured they weren’t that big of a deal, so I kept using it. The charger in the box didn’t work, and I had to use another charger just to charge it. Finally, after a week or two of use, it began glitching where it would zoom in and never zoom back out. I could no longer use the watch and decided to send it back. I don’t think I will be able to trust Amazon refurbished products anymore. I should have trusted the other reviews. DONT ORDER"
154,This is a refurbished watch with reduced battery life and some scratches
155,"I love the watch, could have been a bit cheaper though."
156,Scratches on the dial and on the metal around the screen. HUGE deep scratch on the face that they attempted to fix with a cheap screen protector.
157,The screen has a gap in between the top and bottom. The edge of the screen has sharp edges.
158,The watch itself is nice. The thing is that mine cave with severe scratches on the screen I was about to send it back but has abreast set it up and don’t really trust the seller to give me a timely refund. Just buy a new one. I know I will next time
159,"After failed attempts to pair with iphone, called Apple support.  After almost 60 minute phone conversation and troubleshooting with Apple, we were told to turn it in to law enforcement.  Will not buy from this place again.  Returning for full refund.  If business won't refund, will turn in a claim and get my money back one way or another.  SO disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"
160,This came extremely fast and I love it! It looks brand new!
161,I received the watch and it appeared to be in good condition. But it would not stay on. Every 3 to 4 seconds it would shut itself off and restart. I checked for online solutions and tried everything that was suggested with no changes. I did return the watch within a week and was charged a $202 restocking fee. This is a scam. Do NOT buy.
162,No watch received I only received a charger!!!
163,Everything I wanted
164,"Finger prints on the screen, also they put a really sticky sticker on the back of the watch that barely comes up and leaves residue all over the watch"
165,Looks good came quick no issues thus far.
166,We purchased the watch for the blood oxygen meter it's 4 to 5 points off as compared to the doctors office
167,
168,Me encanta
169,The best
170,"knock off sport band to start.terrible quality screen replacement second. uploaded a photo that shows the significant height difference that is all extra glue in between the screen and body. no confidence that this will survive any level of activity like a new or properly refurbished watch would.and third, shipped with a dead battery.find a seller that knows how to repair watches, or buy new."
171,"Comes in this weird off brand packaging which was immediately a concern. I open it up and it’s FULL of scuffs and scratches, front and back. Couldn’t believe the condition this was in for the price. Didn’t even fire it up, I’m returning immediately. Camera doesn’t capture just how badly it’s damaged"
172,Extremely disappointed
173,"After reading a lot of reviews and seeing how positive they were I decided to purchase and was very disappointed to see the condition of the watch. Multiple scuffs and scratches all over the watch body and dial. I’m sure it’s case by case because it seems many people are getting watches that are in borderline new condition, but I was not impressed when you can get a new one from other retailers for almost the same price if not less for some colors."
174,Watch keeps glitching in and out. This is my second “refurbished” Apple Watch. Neither watch has worked correctly! Very disappointed.
175,The watch came with a sizeable screen gap. It looks like the screen was removed for repair and wasn't re-installed correctly. I'll be sending it back for a refund.
176,The second I opened the package I noticed multiple large scratches on the face. Apparently there is no quality control or the description is incorrect regarding condition. I have a 5 year old Series 3 in much better condition. Very unhappy I waited multiple days for a poor product.
177,Seller sold me a defective items and trying to charged me a restocking fee to hold 90% of my refund. Watch speaker doesn’t work. People can hear you but you can’t hear them.Becareful with this scammer
178,This was just a normal day that started at 7:30 am
179,Need to return it because it is locked and unable to attach to my apple account. they are making me pay for return shipping. Do not buy this product from this vendor...
180,sold me a used product
181,Arrived in different packaging with scratches and dust everywhere on it.
182,Opener the box and the watch face was not attached.  Product listed in “excellent condition”. When purchased.
183,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 My screen was raised and looked very cheap. Display is not aligned correct, I will be spending the extra money to get a brand new one!"
184,Product came linked to a different Apple ID so I couldn’t activate it. Very angry so do not purchase this product!
185,It was supposed to be exceptional condition but instead I got a watch with a shattered screen. Whoever does quality assurance missed the mark on this one
186,I never ever buy online again. Product was scratched and it’s not charging when I send this to my home country. My mistake was I didn’t check when it’s arrived. I cannot bring it back.
187,I received it and the screen is scratched!!! Not to mention there were bugs and trash in my box when I opened it?? Bought this as a gift for someone and was extremely disappointed it was damaged when I opened it!
188,No original packaging.  Cant even tell what series it is.  I never leave reviews but this is totallyNot worth it!  Buy new
189,Do not waist your time or money! I had to pay to have it returned! Totally unexceptable! The watch wouldn't charge! Ruined a birthday present!  Edit; I was refunded 1000 of the 1500 I spent to send the broken thing back!
190,It had deep scratches on the watch face yet was supposed to be 1 of their higher quality renewed units with a premium price so I sent it back
191,DEFECTIVE
192,I purchased this but had to return due to defects in performance and battery life.
193,"Great product, works great thus far but the screen came cracked on arrival. The watch came packed inappropriately. Not in the original box, nor protected very safely."
194,This listing was for an old version of the watch not listed as described pictures
195,I retired it right back
196,Terrible item Came with scratch on front and lot of stick glue on back
197,the screen was scratched and didn't look as new
198,"This product is very bad, don’t buy that"
199,"Dirty, grimy and scratched up, bad quality product."
200,"do not buy this iwatch is sooo fake  looking, please do not buy and waste your money guys!!"
201,"Not impressed with a ""refurbished"" product. How hard can it be to at least clean the screen? Very disappointing."
202,Scam alert!!!
203,Packaging appeared to come from Apple yet there was no watch in the box. Only the charging cable and the band.
204,The Old user/owner of the Watch is yet to unlinked the watch from his/her iCloud account of devices.
205,Been on charger for 10+ hours won’t hold a charge. Save your money
206,"Watch battery couldn’t hold a charge, still waiting on refund"
207,The screen was green
208,"Purchased as a Christmas gift. The first time in the pool with his toddler son, it immediately stopped working. Obviously during the repair process, it was not water sealed"
209,This was given to me as a gift…. It was defective on arrival. Sent it back and waited over a month for refund and they still can’t get it right. It was returned right away with packing slip. It was received by dock next day. That was the last update I got. Nothing but the run around since. So buyer beware. Hopefully you get one that works….
210,Screen didn't match watch and edge was hanging over.  The lip would have gotten caught on something and ripped off very easily.  Watch also had dirt in all the small crevices which was gross.
211,"Always doing something you didn’t ask it today. Never does what you want it to do. If it was going to be useful, you would want it to display the information you asked for. Always starts some other app or is busy. Quite often messes up my phone. I hate this watch."
212,I can’t give a complete review because this  watch is a gift.  But I received it in a couple of days.  Had I not known it was renewed I wouldn’t have been able to tell.  It was very affordable and I know a young man who is going to freak out when he opens it.
213,"just got the watch, it was less then half charged. Expected. I gave it 5 stars because it looks new!It looks new. No Scratches, came in a weird electronic box but it was pretty much refurbished so it doesn’t matter  The product itself, we shall see how long the battery life lasts and functions"
214,"When I went to buy the watch I was very skeptical about the price. It’s a WHOLE lot less than other Apple Watches. Anyway when I got the watch it came with a Samsung block. I’m not sure why, but in the grand scheme of things….does it really matter? After setting up the watch and using it for the day it’s absolutely great!"
215,Watch looks and performs just as good as a new one. Honestly idk why it’s even called a used one it was still in its original packaging as if I bought it brand new from an att store. Thank you guys much appreciated!
216,Had a series 4 so getting a series 6 was awesome. Love the watch.
217,That came fast and looked like it was brand new
218,Item is Awesome! Thanks
219,The media could not be loaded.
220,Great gift for an Apple lover
221,Awesome
222,"Good product for price, no issue’s"
223,No complaints a lot cheaper than purchasing from the store and there is no difference in product.
224,Gift for my daughter. She loves it
225,"I was very weary about ordering a renewed watch, but was tight for money and figured I would give it a shot. It was so so worth it. The watch works perfect and came in the original apple packaging, flawlessly connected to my phone and battery lasts me at least 2 maybe 3 days. If you aren’t wanting to splurge on a brand new watch this is definitely the way to go."
226,"Very easy to set up apps and synchronize with iPhone. Great for tracking workouts/exercises, playing music, answering phone calls, etc. Can do many iPhone functions without having to actually use your iPhone.  Oh, I tells time also. 😁.  I couldn’t be happier with my watch."
227,Great value
228,Was a little skeptical about a refurbished watch but I don't regret this purchase at all. The watch works as it should. It was a snap to pair with my 14 Pro. Saved several hundred dollars.
229,This was a great deal and it was nice the best people to order from thanks
230,Good Product
231,I get that’s it’s refurbished but came with knock off watch band and not in original packing. I was going to send back but they want me to pay to return. Other than that seems OK. Spend the extra $ for S7 or real
232,Yes battery life on the Apple Watch still not good because the Fitbit watch is 100% better than Apple Watch battery life
233,Good value for someone on the fence on whether or not to get an Apple Watch.
234,"All my expectations for this Watch were exceeded. Battery life, the look, time it takes to fully charge, all the apps it has. Ability to take phone calls. Overall 5/5"
235,There is a scratch on screen. But anyway it works adequately. Battery life was ok
236,"This is my third Apple Watch and each has been purchased here as ‘Renewed’, and each has been a good value and worked perfectly. My latest, the Series 6, came packaged in the original box with new (or at least they appeared new) accessories. It was also delivered to my door in record time by FedEx. Now, one might argue that the Apple Watch itself is a bit pricey for what you get, but I like the seamless extension of my iPhone and the advantages that gives over other smart watches. And the price-to-value discussion has been beat to death. To my mind, it’s worth it. To others, not so much. But in the end, this review is about buying renewed and after three renewed watch purchases, I believe it’s the best deal going."
237,This reconditioned Apple Watch works great.
238,Fast shipping and watch is in good condition but the battery life is not good. I guess I will have to buy another charger to keep at work.
239,Been waiting for an Apple Watch and this one is perfect
240,"I was extremely skeptical of the Apple Watch when it first hit the market. To be frank, I thought they were pretentious and unnecessary. Over time, I saw how my friends and coworkers enjoyed theirs, so I decided to jump on the bandwagon and I am so glad I did. I will be the first to admit I was wrong.Like a fair amount of the American population, I have ADD. Also like a fair amount of the American population, I sit behind a computer from 8-5. I would hyper focus and go hours working on a project without standing or taking a break. With my apple watch, it quietly and quickly vibrates every hour to remind me to stand up, and I will walk a lap. Then come back to my work. I like the challenge of meeting my goals (which are adjustable) and I can “compete” with my friends in different states for bragging rights regarding meeting goals.I also do not “doomsday scroll” on my iPhone at nights as much, because I can leave my phone in another room knowing I won’t miss a text or a call due to the texts/calls coming through on my watch.Overall, as ridiculous as typing it out is, this watch has been a good tool for my mental and physical health. I’ve lost weight (and kept it off). I will cave and admit that this watch is great."
241,"I finally bought an Apple watch because I've been wanting to improve my mental health with more physical activities. At first I was annoyed by all the notifications I received on the watch; it's essentially a mirror of your smartphone. After I turned most of them off except phone calls/texts it was much better to use.While the battery life is not as long as other competition out there, there are some features that I think make the watch worth it:1. Fitness+- LOVE THIS APP! I'm currently trailing it free for 3 months, and it's a game changer. I love how there is new content weekly for different exercises like kickboxing, pilates, HIIT, yoga, dance, etc. I have a smart tv and stream the videos on there. I get to see my heart rate and calories burned LIVE, so it motivates me to work harder. You can also filter the exercises by duration, music genre, fitness instructor, and more! I will definitely be keeping the subscription after my trial is over; it''s definitely worth it.2. Daily/weekly challenges with myself and friends- I enjoy the rings concept and connecting with my friends who also have an Apple watch. I get notifications of when they complete a workout, which encourages me to exercise myself.3. Find My- I use this app constantly to find my phone in another room.4. Direct streaming to my iPhone- it is nice to see my stats on my phoneOverall, if you're considering getting an Apple Watch, do it. I selected this one because I don't need the data option, and this is a budget friendly enough device for so much value."
242,"I've had several Apple watches and so far have been happy with them.  My one complaint is that I HAVE NO WAY TO CHARGE THIS THING, and thank goodness I have my charger from the previous watch.  While the charger it comes with looks just like the others, the end of it IS NOT USB.  It is much smaller and I have absolutely NOTHING in my possession that I can plug it into.  I thought it would plug into my phone, perhaps, but it doesn't fit.  I have an Apple computer but there are no ports that match the watch charger, either.  So, I'm SOL on using the charger it came with until I figure out what to do.  I realize all I need is to perhaps buy something but I'm not willing to go there since I can use my other charger which works fine.  As for the watch itself, I really do like it.  I appreciate the extra storage space and it definitely works faster.  I can store more music in it and the large variety of watch faces is a plus for me.  There are more than enough apps on this and I turned off the ones I know I'll never use - some are ridiculous - such as, it senses when you are washing your hands and starts a 20 second timer.  That's too much ""big brother"" type stuff for me - I don't need help.  I would recommend that if you are replacing this with an older Apple Watch that you choose the manual setup and don't allow it to automatically set based on your old watch.  This is how I was able to catch what I would consider too much nosiness and turn it off.  I mainly use the watch for running, listening to music, catching phone calls and emails, etc...just daily stuff.  So I don't need anything over the top.  However, for the average person, this is a great watch with more than enough functions.  All of the bands for my previous watch fit it as well.  Just know that if you purchase this, you won't be disappointed with the watch itself, but beware that you won't be able to charge in a USB.  I don't know what Apple was thinking on that one.  Finally, there are NO charging instructions or explanations."
243,"I absolutely hate apple products but my mum loves apple. Loves her iphone and always wanted an apple watch. So finally I broke down and bought her this one for a Christmas present last 2022 and she absolutely loves it. Now, seeing as how I do not have not use it I can not really give an indepth review on the product, 4 months later, it is part of her daily kit and routine. So, (shudders) 5...stars. 😖"
244,"Watch works fine, like all smart watches. Wish battery lasted longer.  Also wished it had a blood pressure monitor.  Have another smart watch, which was a third of the cost of the Apple Watch and it included a blood pressure monitor.  No issues with this watch so far."
245,Idk why it took this long to finally get one of these . So easy to set up. Looks good with the different band we got here on Amazon the apple bands are just way too much money for what they are. The battery life for my wife is OK it lasts more than a day but we charge it every day around the same time to make sure it doesn’t run out.
246,I had an Apple Watch Series 3 for 4 years up until I decided to upgrade to this! And I love it! I love the size of the 40 mm because it’s comfortable on my hand and it works very well and charges super fast!
247,"I’ve had Apple Watches from the very beginning. Sadly, my earlier model needed replacing due to a cracked screen. So, I ordered this one late last year and I’m very happy that I did! It’s sleek, accurate and beautiful."
248,Love my watch. There are less missed messages and calls since the watch vibrates. I can choose if I want to interrupt what I am doing. Easy set up. Pairing with iPhone is user friendly. A lot of extras for health. Definitely a good choice for me.
249,"I’ve had this watch for a couple of months and cannot say enough good things! It makes it easy to track your workouts and heart rate. Very easy to set up and use, not to mention the battery lasts me 2 days! Don’t know how I lived without it! Also great for easily seeing my notifications when I’m working from home! Love being able to see work things while moving around my house"
250,"I was skeptical at first because it was from the Amazon Warehouse, however mine was brand new! Box was unopened as was the watch band! It was easy to sync up and I got it wayyyyy cheaper than going to target or the Apple Store"
251,Even though it was a refurbished item it’s working like I just bought it from the Apple Store.
252,"It's incredible, the product seems as good as one new and the battery health was a 100%"
253,I purchased the midnight aluminum in 40 mm and really love it! It’s my first Apple Watch and I can’t believe I waited so long. Shipping was super fast.
254,"I've worn this watch now for a few months and really like it.  It's great to see who is calling without taking my phone out of my pocket every time my phone rings. I do wish it had face dial with larger Day/Date in the corner. My 64  year old eyes cant see the smaller Date or Temp in the corners. Being able to hang up on annoying spam calls from my watch, leaving my phone in my pocket is the best feature."
255,These are obviously great watches. Unfortunately I don’t have one because they are very expensive! But they are great gifts!
256,The watch is great for most users because it has most of the basic features you would need in a smart watch. This is especially a great buy for people on a budget. I only wished that the battery life lasted a bit longer. I have the gps only watch so I don’t know how it fares on a cellular network but it’s nice that you can walk a bit of distance from your watch and still have access to the internet. I mostly use the watch to get notifications from my phone without having to take out my phone (at work).
257,I debated for a few years whether or not to get one of these watches. I didn’t want it to be a bigger distraction or keep me on my phone more. But it’s actually done the opposite! I check my messages real quick and don’t have to pull my phone out of my purse! Battery life is ok. I have to charge mine every night. Plus there are so many bands and cases you can get for it to Make it your own style!
258,Had this for about a week now. Really happy with purchase. Came in wonderfully packaged. Brand new from box. So far it’s working as it should. Connected to my phone easily. Battery is the same as my old watch (s5). Will last all day and through the night but needs to be placed on charger to last the next morning which is fine because I take mine off every night and place it on it’s charger til 100% then turn it off until next day. Came with small size band which were perfect. Beautiful color. Came with charging  cord. NOTE: the charging cable is a C charger. have to have a C port charging block. Over all I love it so much. Will update when I’ve had it over two months!Buy this watch!
259,Welcome to the 21st century.  Amazing. Don’t know how I lived without it
260,The battery could last longer and I don’t think I understand the feature
261,"I had the Fitbit Versa 2 prior to purchasing the Apple Watch SE.  I love a number of the features that I did not have before.  The integration with my iPhone and the ability to take and receive calls is great.  It senses a fall which since I am well into my senior years means a lot.  While there are an abundance of health and fitness apps for the SE I’d have to say that the Fitbit App beats anything I have found so far for the SE.  The Fitbit had a battery life that lasted about a week - the SE barely  makes it through one day if you use very many of the SE’s capabilities - a real problem if you use the sleep monitoring function.  Overall the SE is a great, solid feeling watch, but is very lacking is a couple of critical areas."
262,Solid for sleep apps and heart monitor.
263,"Me encanto esta compra, excelente precio y calidad"
264,Me encanto
265,I wish battery life was better. I have turned off  a lot of notifications on this watch. But I like the idea of “fall detection” and answering phone calls and texts from my watch
266,"I got this after a serious illness to help me track my activity as o work to regain my strength and muscle tone.  Being old school it was hard to wear it in the pool but I got there!  The find your phone feature has proven useful as well.  I’ve purchased several wristbands for fun, I like the flexibility with this feature.  I’m very pleased with this watch!!"
267,Watch stop working  and couldn't  be charged. We did the recommended procedure and still nothing happens
268,Very fashionable
269,"UPGRADES from Watch SE (2020):-S8 chip: Up to 20% faster than previous Watch SE in theory (previous version was using S5 chip)-Crash detection:  Will detect if you are in a crash (same tech in iPhone14 and Watch Series 8)-Price: Starts at $249, currently older Watch SE (2020) is still priced at $269Other changes:  Back of watch is no longer ceramic, now just plastic and aluminumSo, not huge changes from the previous SE really.  This watch comes with OS 9, but the older SE (2020) is also able to upgrade its software to Watch OS 9.  So far in testing, the battery life also seems to be about the same as the older SE.  So OVERALL, it does not seem to me to be worth upgrading from the old SE to this SE2.  I haven’t been able to notice much of a difference, and I actually prefer the ceramic back of the old SE (2020).  If you feel the need to upgrade from SE (2020), you might want to look at the other new Watch 8 models that have more features.----CHOOSING BETWEEN WATCH SE2 AND WATCH 8?:Compared to Watch Series 8, this SE2 is missing these features:-No ECG, No blood oxygen, No temp sensor:  These sensors on Watch 8 can provide more health data.-No fast charging:  Fast Charging is supported on Watch 7 series and Watch 8 series (including Watch Ultra).-No IP6X dust resistance:  Watch 8 has an IP6X rating, which means that it is safe from dust/debris.-No Always-On-Display:  Watch 8 has Always-On-Display.-Size:  The Watch 8 face is bigger (41mm and 45mm, vs 40mm and 44mm), but with smaller bezels; resulting in 20% more screen area on Watch 8 compared to SE2.-No U1 Ultra-Wideband: U1 chip allows for more precise location of devices, for use in multiple applications.-Battery:  Watch 8 has 308mAh battery, SE2 is listed at 296mAh (both rated 18 hours though).Currently Watch 8 is about $150 more than SE2, so it is up to you to decide if you want to spend more to get access to these additional features.  For me, the biggest noticeable differences between the two are the screen size, Always-On-Display, and charging speeds.  The Always-On-Display makes a difference of a second or two whenever you get a notification, not a huge deal but noticeable.  I also like the faster charging of Watch 8 because I usually sleep with my Watch on to get sleep tracking data, so I mainly charge during the day, and being able to do that faster means more time actually wearing the watch.Ultimately, you’ll have to decide what is important to you, and if you need an even more rugged/durable Watch for lots of rough outdoor use, there is always the Watch 8 Ultra.  Ultra is even bigger, brighter, and more durable, with a bigger battery and feature designed to cater to outdoor activities."
270,"The Apple Watch is great and the features are very good.  However the battery life is not very good.  I have to recharge it every night.  I thought the battery would last at least a couple of days, but I have to charge it every night so I am unable to have it record my sleep patterns."
271,Happy
272,"Yes I do own an iphone but not a Apple maniac, had a electronic knockoff watch for the past few years and was given this for Xmas, very happy with it, linked to my phone so can dictate text messages when I have my hands full or my phone is somewhere in the houseDidnt get the Cellular version as the phone companies figure its another phone so charge you for another line *^#*@(* but for my needs its perfect, not really sure how many people need the cellular version, as long as you have wifi you dont really need it"
273,Bought this SE watch for my non-technical wife. It’s easy to use and my wife loves it.
274,
275,Used on a daily basis and enjoying all features
276,"The battery in my old watch I have had 5 or more years and that battery is going strong on that and it only cost $55  and this apple watch was almost $300 and the batter needs charged every 12 hours or 24 or it dead..... being it cost $300 almost, the battery should last 10 years or more before a charge"
277,I had to buy a different band but the actual watch works well.
278,Battery lasts a long time! Great quality and it looks great!!
279,"This watch is amazing! It can do so much, With some really cool features such as the mickey or minnie watch face and when you tap them it says the time in there voice! So cute! The only thing pretty much is that its not a usb charger. It come with the charging wire, but you need a specific head for it! Thankfully, Awhile ago i bought an ipad that came with a charging head perfect for the watch charger. If you have a oculus, im pretty sure you could use that head too because my sister has one and the head for it works! All in all, i'd 100% recommend, Just make sure you also purchase the right head with it!"
280,Excelente producto
281,"Wife loves it, seems to work great but it has to be charged every nite"
282,THEY DON'T TELL YOU WHAT TO CHARGE IT INTO!  ITS A VERY SMALL PORT TYPE IT ONLY FITS A PORT ON MY COMPUTER TO CHARGE THE DAMN WATCH.  NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CHARGE THE WATCH! Something was either missing or just bad directions which doesnt seem like Apple.  I should have bought this watch from Apple not Amazon.  Big waste of my time. Buyer beware of the instructions.  The watch doesnt come powered up.  The instructions tell you it comes on right away. It doesn't!  Not happy.
283,"I am completely heartbroken,DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN iPhone 8 or higher with ios 16 or higher!!ALSO DOES NOT COME WITH TYPE C WALL CHARGER REQUIRES IT TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY.I have wanted an Apple watch for a while now but i am disabled and very low income.after looking things up and going back and forth with my decision I finally landed on making the purchase because I felt informed enough and I still had deeply wanted one.I ordered it and got it a few days later, started setting it up and, bam first issue, no wall charger...found one and ordered it with 2 options, either order it overnight for an additional charge or wait a week for it to get here.I ordered it and it arrived, watch charged fine,then BAM second issue, it REQUIRES pairing with an iphone""luckily"", I thought, I had one from a purchase from a birthday gift a couple years agoI got the phone charged and turned on but the watch pairing said the ios was not updated on the phone. so I initiated the update and install,few minutes later the phone was updated, tried the pairing again and BAM another issue,the ios for iPhone 7 apparently only goes up to ios 15.5.7 or something like that and i am now stuck trying to figure out if I should keep the watch and save up for a refurb iphone 8 or higher or send the watch back for a refund.Heartbreaking :("
284,Love this watch. Battery life could be better but its alright. One thing to beware of is the amount of scratches this thing gets and the photo is only within 50 hours of using it. I will be buying screen protectors because there are many more tiny scratches that my camera wont pick up
285,Nice watch
286,Best
287,"I have small wrists, and it was just the right size. Feels great and works well!"
288,Granddaughter loves the watch.uses it daily
289,"Liked the black color as it matches with any band. 44mm felt large at first but it’s helpful to see everything. Only downfall is the texting element. Previous versions/software updates had a tiny keyboard you swipe across and it uses predictive text to pick your word. This one has a voice text option, and instead of a keyboard, a little screen on which you write each letter with your finger. You have to press space after each word, and doesn’t understand cursive so you have to lift your finger each time. Some letters are confused for others (I.e.: if I want to write 1, I can’t just draw a line. I have to draw a classic one. J’s can be U’s, p’s can be misconstrued as b’s if you’re going too fast.) It takes forever and is annoying and unhelpful in times when it’s inappropriate to use voice text. Unsure if it’s the newer watches or a software thing."
290,Lo único malo es que la batería se descarga rápido
291,"Fast shipping, everything is okay"
292,Excellent Apple product watch. Bought this watch for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. Of course I bought mine about five years ago and Apple watches are great.
293,my wife love it
294,The watch is great but its 40mm and the band was 41mm. Thankfully I purchased a different band anyway but just a little disappointing. I’m terrible about returning things. I’ve already connected my phone to the watch and don’t know if I would have to return the whole thing if I did want the correct size. Love the watch though!
295,Bought this for my kid and she absolutely loves it.  Great value for the price and would absolutely purchase again.
296,Easy to charge and wonderful connectivity.
297,"I did not know that one has to have an iPhone to set up the Apple watch.  Not being Apple people here, I was very disappointed to learn that I could not set it up using an android phone.  So I returned it to Amazon with absolutely no problem and got my refund in a couple of days!  Way to go Amazon!!!  So, I bought a FitBit from Amazon and my wife loves it."
298,"After switching back over to an iPhone, I decided to give the Apple Watch SE 2 a try since it was on sale for Black Friday. I didn't think there would be much use for it other than the fitness tracker but I was pleasantly surprised. The fitness tracking is great but I am highly suspicious of the estimated calories burned when tracking traditional weight training. Having Apple Pay on your wrist is really convenient and the walkie-talkie function is super cool. I also like how you can answer phone calls from your wrist in case your phone isn't on you at the time. I am terrible about charging my devices so I wish the battery life was better but you can get through a solid day and a half if you aren't fiddling with the watch too much. If you don't care about having an always on display and are a dude like me that doesn't need a thermometer for menstruation tracking, get this one and save a bunch of money."
299,Great quality watch from Apple
300,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I waited a long time to get at Apple Watch and this is the one to get. Big face, lasts a couple days, charges to 100% while you’re in the shower, notifications quicker, haptic alarm clock, fitness tracker."
301,"I wish someone would’ve wrote that or they should let you know that you need a different thing that you plug in the wall. You can’t use the regular ones if they were to let me know I could’ve ordered it so I don’t know the answers to the other questions because I can’t charge it yet, but I’ll let you know when I do how it goes but just make sure you buy one of them"
302,The battery doesn’t last as long as I had hoped
303,Much better for smaller wrists.
304,Buen estado
305,As ordered
306,"I recently decided to pass along my Series 3 as an entry level gift to my parent. The watch is pretty, sleek, and well designed. There's no doubt about that. It's just about the same exact watch, with a few additional features that aren't all that revolutionary. The battery life is about the same as well, if not worse. I charge it and the battery is already 45% through half a day. My 3 was lasting all day and would end up about 60% by the time I lay down.Overall, I'm neutral on this device. It's nice, though, but I slightly regret passing off my old watch."
307,I used this IWatch to replace my first one and it works great.  The screen is a little bigger which is nice.  I'm sure this one will last several years like the first one did.
308,Got his for the wife for Christmas she loves it
309,"This was for my wife, she likes it! The SE is not as many features as the regular Apple watches but fits what she needs."
310,"I've always wanted to purchase an apple watch but was hesitant because I have small wrist and most face watches don't sit right.  I decided to purchase the 30"" face and it fits perfect.  This watch app was easy to set up as  I didn't need by kids or grandkids to help...lol.  I'm enjoying the fitness portion of the app.  I've made a great choice on this product.  In addition, AMAZON offered 6-mo financing which was a big plus of the purchase."
311,"I'm a woman with a small frame (5'5"" but a 5.5"" wrist, so.... tiny) and I wore the Apple Watch 8 41mm for a bit but it was just too large even at that size. I swapped it out for the SE and the 1mm reduction in screensize is not a negative at all, and the size difference is a big positive on my wrist. This one is actually comfortable to wear.For $250, this is a good watch. Battery life is the same as the Watch 8. Charging speed is similar. If you don't think you'll want features like the always-on screen and the temperature tracking (I didn't like or use either of those features), save your money and get the SE instead."
312,Good tool to talk and text.  Also like the activity tracking features!
313,this watch is perfect….i had previously purchased an apple 4 cellular watch brand new for about $500 bucks …watch os7 trashed my battery life…i was charging that watch twice daily….(i feel apple knew what the problem was but didn’t care…i got absolutely no help from them at all)…so i decided to get a new watch but as cheap as i could because i will NEVER spend big bucks on apple products again…enter se 2 gen watch and it is just what my other watch used to be….i can even wear this for over two days and still have about 25 to 30 percent battery…true this does not have the ekg thing my 4 did but who cares…if that is important to you go with it…not for me..i wanted battery life….i will now keep apple care for as long as i have this watch but i loved the fact that this was so inexpensive (235.00) compared to what i paid for the other one…
314,"I bought this watch after being a Fitbit user for years & my last watch absolutely died! I was conflicted on either staying with Fitbit or getting an Apple Watch.I have Apple accessories, so it only made sense to stay in the family, right?!Shopped around for the right Apple Watch, for me. And since I am big into fitness, I needed another watch-pronto! Hence, Amazon!When I came across this beauty, I read the reviews, saw the Apple warranty and decided to go for it!Price was decent. Delivery time was great! And, the color of both the watch and band were nice!When it arrived a couple days after purchase, I felt like a little kid on Christmas!It took me a second, though, to learn this new device’s ins-and-outs. But after I did, I now ask myself what took me so long to switch!?Even though the battery life isn’t perfect (a day and a half), it’s not bothersome due to its other great features.The best feature so far to me is the dial-I can control my AirPods volume with it! Amazing I tell ya! I’m hooked on this watch now, and you will be too-LOL!"
315,"Wasn’t sure if I would like an Apple Watch, so I wanted to try the SE Second generation. This watch does everything I wanted it to. I use it to track all of my steps and all of my different workouts. I also love that I can get and send texts from my watch. The only thing I can’t do is send or receive texts if my phone is not nearby. I would def purchase this watch again."
316,Love it
317,The watch came in brand new in its original container. It works fabulously! It has so many new features that my old watch did not have. No issues with the watch at all.
318,Bought for my parents they loved it
319,This watch for gift so they’re looking latest brand. Thank you
320,"Like all apple products, this watch is excellent. It’s accurate and intuitive and very easy to use. It definitely is a quality product. I’ve had 3 fitbits and this is truly an upgrade."
321,"I love all products from Apple. No complains. Well, I hope that the price can be lower..."
322,"I felt this was the best value for my money.  I was already familiar with my earlier apple watch so the mobile app was good and easy to use just like with my series 2.  If you are considering this watch look at the difference between the SE and 8 or 8 plus.  Further, if battery life is an issue the 8 plus offers  by far the longest battery life. They have the always on face and a couple of features which the SE does not. The always on face and other features were really not important to me.  However, go to the Apple Website and look at the feature comparisons.  They may very well be worth you spending a little more money for the upgrade.  You can't go wrong with an Apple watch just make sure you get the watch you want with the features that are important to you."
323,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 this is such a pretty watch 🥺i was so worried i’d get it scratched but nopeit came in the original packaging the only thing is that it was opened for inspection (there’s a sticker and tape around the watch box to check that it’s the actual watch lol) but i didn’t care and overall it’s so good 😭i’d def recommend it <3"
324,This is my second Apple Watch- the other fell apart after 6 years- but so far so good with this one.  It has functions the old watch didn't have (I really like the bpm on the face of the watch). My only criticism is it didn't come with a charging plug to the wall outlet. I'm having to unplug my iPad outlet to charge the watch. Ugh.
325,You know
326,It’s a good watch but honestly I don’t wear it to much
327,It came perfectly
328,"Muy buen reloj, tiene todo lo que necesitas y mas por un costo accesible"
329,"I am so happy I bought my Apple Watch. Overall I love my watch for keeping track of exercise and taking incoming calls and texts. I feel like it helps me stay off my phone but aware if someone messages me. I know someone with an older version and I can definitely tell the difference in speed while doing normal typing/ scrolling etc. I am glad I got this one due to the not lagging speed compared to other. I can get two days battery life out of my Apple Watch. The charge is fast, but extended battery life is always a plus for future improvements."
330,"I really like it, but lost of scratches accumulate on both the watch, the case, and the screen. I also noticed that my fingernails imprint a crescent on the band."
331,The charger provided did not work. Apple did not supply a replacement but I could purchased a new one. This is poor customer service on a new item.
332,"To begin with, the package came in earlier than expected. It's also my first time ordering an Apple watch off of amazon and it worked beyond amazing. I recommend getting this apple watch, this series is amazing!"
333,"Im not up to date on technology, but the watch was easy to set up. The battery life is great. Still exploring its capabilities on the watch. All in all i loving it!"
334,My husband was shooing a bug out of the car window and the watch band came loose and his watch flew out the window and to have it fixed costa almost as much as some of the watches! Get a different band is my suggestion. I bought it for him for Christmas and now it’s useless!
335,"I have the 7 and got two of these for my daughter. I was A littler nervous and read all the reviews carefully. Other than it doesn’t do the EKG, it does everything my 7 does for 1/3 of the price."
336,"This is my first time buying smart-watch, and was beyond my expectation.Goes well with my iPhone, applepay and now it is totally part of my life.Also it gave me an opportunity to re-think about my daily activity, sleep quality, etc..Definetely recommend."
337,"The watch was OK as product; tried to activate it but the battery life was very short, as if it was not charging correctly. The second watch I didn't even take it out of the box as it was missing a strap.I set it up a bit before send it back because the box was open and didn't look like it was new.It may be an issue with the specific seller, can't say, but out of 2 purchases, both arrived not sealed."
338,"If you are having trouble pairing this to your iPhone please read the following review. First you must have an iPhone 8 or newer model. Second, and most importantly, you must be running iOS 16 or greater. I got this watch a few days ago and I could not wait to pair it with my iPhone 13.It would pair then unpair and over and over again. I tried to manually pair it, I reset my phone, the watch, my network settings (all of these tips were found online) but none of them mentioned needing the latest iOS. My phone updates automatically so I assumed I was on the latest iOS. I was not.It took me about 45 minutes for the phone and watch to update and finally pair.This watch is good but not great. The battery life is just not there yet. If you want to wear this watch for the fitness aspect of it and track your sleep data as well as have it as a shortcut to read messages and see notifications throughout the day it doesn’t give you much time during the day or night to charge it. I did all the battery saving tips and it was still only good for about a day and a half. Kinda like my phone. And it gets worse if you want full functionality.I also wanted to use this with my Arccos golf tracking system but the battery really goes quick using gps for an entire round of golf and it does not give you anything more than a very plain numeric only display with basic yardages. It was very comfortable to wear and it does have very cool customizable watch faces but the poor battery life was a deal breaker. Sorry but it’s heading back."
339,I’m happy with my watch
340,100% nuevo
341,This made a great Christmas gift for my significant other. She absolutely loves the color and design. I do wish this had the option to ship with the smaller band as she has very petite wrists.
342,"If you are wondering if this is the model to get if you want to hook this up to your phone or your family plan (for your kid) the answer is ""NO"" - this is GPS only and you need the model that has cell as well as GPS. We studied this question, and could not get a definitive answer, so bought this model because some reviews seemed to indicate this model would do the job. It did not.When we tried to hook it up this did not work out as planned. The details are in the fine print. Save yourselves the headache, spring for the extra $$ and buy the cell model. The ""cel"" model has its own phone #  - When you link the watch to your phone you can decide whether to use the watch as a phone or not (in other words, does not have to ring) but without the cell you will be unable to use this for your kid to send messages or to know their whereabouts.Sometimes technology is not easy. Apple also generally assumes you know more than you do and their explanations do not always get you where you want to be. It's not you, its them."
343,Had to wait to give  a review so far everything is working as should no complications with the watch the the shipment was fast and personally delivered. So it's all 5 stars for me
344,"I got this watch for a very affordable price as a Christmas gift. While it’s doesn’t light up all the time, I’m happy as it gives me privacy and improves the battery life. As an introduction into Apple Watch, this is a great watch to start."
345,"I purchased this in November for my birthday and so far like it a lot. I have no trouble with the battery life, it lasts a long time. The screen display does go off and it comes back on when you move your wrist up…occasionally it isn’t as responsive as I would like it to be, but this feature does save on battery life and it’s not a deal breaker for me. I’m pleased with the functions of this watch and would buy again. It does motivate me to exercise more."
346,"La compatibilidad que tiene con el iPhone es excelente, adicional la batería y comodidad le da un valor agregado"
347,"This is why I am most favorite purchases in a long time.  I love the Fitbit watch that my husband had  purchased for me several years ago, but it was time for an upgrade.  This watch is a good starter watch I think into the Apple series, especially for those like me or not tech savvy. . It comes with a lot of cool features for working out and a lot of programs that I’m still discovering.  Battery life doesn’t seem as long as my Fitbit however, because of all the cool features that it offers I understand why the charge speed he’s pretty fast.,  on a scale of 1 to 10 I am definitely at 10 with my purchase stay on satisfied."
348,"The battery lasts for about 2 days with everything turned off and minimal use, less than a day with every function on. I feel like we can do better, but here we are. I like it and basically use it to track exercise, steps, and sleep. It seems to be pretty accurate. I don’t think I’ll replace it when it doesn’t update anymore."
349,I bought it for my husband ad Christmas present. He loves it. It not the latest model but he just want something he can check his email or text messages without looking at his phone.
350,"Overall I love the watch, I love that you can alert your phone from it if you misplaced your phone, you can answer calls on it.My only dislike is having you write out your text messages, definitely would be so much better even with a T9 keyboard!"
351,Excelente producto
352,Mostly a fun toy for grown ups. Battery sucks; you'll need to charge it every day. My wife uses it to compete on the fitness app with her friends.
353,"Me gusto mucho él reloj creo que es muy práctico y bello, lo único malo sería que la Banda era muy grande talla M/L y yo soy S en la descripción decía Banda S"
354,I really like this watch. It keeps the time accurately. I can talk on it as well as get alerts on it. I can accessorize it with multiple bands. Great value.
355,Purchased one for our oldest son. Good price point with features compared to the latest version of the Apple Watches. So happy with it that I bought another one for my wife.
356,"I was a little worried based on the other reviews but I love this watch! It's come in handy and it works very well, I kind of forget I'm wearing it. Highly recommend."
357,I love I can respond to text messages by speaking into the watch. I love all the apps this was definitely a great upgrade.
358,"Surprise Christmas gift for my son, which he enjoys!"
359,Cool watch. Battery only last a day.
360,"There is nothing I dislike. It’s perfect for me.  Thank God.  A blessing in disguise. In 2019, I started on A-Fib, after that, I purchased mine.  It let me know on time that I was on A-Fib twice, one in 2020, another in 2021. Got med attention on time, by making one aware, and rush to the hospital.  EVERYONE SHOULD GET ONE. Thanks A/W."
361,Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to operate and has a great battery life.
362,"The Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) has to be the best value Apple Watch in the lineup. Sure, you can spend a couple hundred more for a few more features but I don't think it's worth it. I've owned a few Apple Watches and they provide a similar experience regardless of price, at least for my use cases. This watch has the latest processor which is able to give it the extra power it needs to continue to feel snappy for years to come. It's just as comfortable as any other Apple Watch. It also tracks your steps, workouts, and sleep just as well as the more expensive Apple Watches. So, for my money, this is the best value you can get for an Apple Smart watch that isn't a generation old."
363,it did not come the the c adapter to charge the phone . nor was there any heads up that i would have to buy one
364,this watch is perfect i’ve had an apple watch before but broke it and needed a new one. i was a little worried ordering it from amazon but it’d exactly the same came in an apple box and everything there’s no difference at all ordering it from amazon than from apple. i love my apple watch!
365,Great product except for the short battery life.
366,"Should have updated a few years ago, glad I finally got around to doing so. So happy that I chose to go up in size to the 44mm. Wondered if it would be too large on my wrist, but I love the slightly oversized look. For reference I have the S/M band and it's closed on the second hole from the top. Using the apps is much easier on the 44mm too."
367,"It definitely worth it. This is my first Apple Watch, and I'm so happy about it. It's very convenient, easy to wear. The battery last around 36 hours. Unfortunately, this model doesn't have the electrocardiogram feature. I was looking forward to it.If you're looking for an apple watch, and it's gonna be your first one, the SE2 Apple watch is for you."
368,"My wife has some trouble with all that her new Apple watch does, but the joy of having it overcomes the learning curve. She has family and trip pictures scrolling across the face of the watch, and she is always showing the pictures to others. I am tickled to see her finding such joy in her Apple watch."
369,"1st apple watch so I do not have anything to compare it to. Watched a lot of videos about comparing the SE, #8 and Ultra. Chose the SE for the lower cost and the others had extra features that I could live without. I have been wanting an apple watch for ever! I am very pleased with my purchase and I can not wait to see what apps I can put to use."
370,Excelente compra
371,"Upgraded from Apple Watch 3 42mm. I was doing in that watch everything, taking shower, washing dishes, swimming in lakes and in the ocean. Finally they died after I did a scuba dive recently  for 30ft or 10-12 meters :) I opened it to see what is going on inside and was shocked. Th3 watch was so heavily damaged by rust and corrosion inside, lots of leakage. I have to say I am surprised they survived for such a long time. Though Apple say it is water resistant up to 50 meters it looks it is not, so take care of your watch."
372,"I had Apple Watch 6 (40mm) stainless steel. It looks good but very heavy for that size and the pointy bottom with sensor was breaking my wrist. So I bought this same size model of SE2.It looks and feels the same as 6. But lighter. Not too much 15g or so. But it gives not as much pressure on the wrist. I prefer Samsung watches’ bottom as they are flatter. But last couple of their iterations do not sync with iPhone.SE2 is much faster in everything. You can see it fly through everything.Battery is not good. Even though this doesn’t have always on function, if you wear 12hr or more you will need to charge it. Not good.Strap is mine. But this strap is lighter than the one comes with the watch.But at $250 I’m not complaining.So buy it"
373,"I personally have never been disappointed by any Apple products. The watch is no exception. I use it mostly as a backup for my iPhone. I don’t miss calls, email, texts or alarms. Since I am often not sure where I left my phone that is very handy. I bought the SE because it was the most reasonable priced. I’m glad I did."
374,"Love my Apple Watch.  I bought it for Fall Detection, but have found lots of other useful features.  Much cheaper in the long run than “Help, I’ve fallen and I can’t get up” devices.iPhone locator, timer, reminder alarms, “where am I?”  Plus, it’s always with you — right there on your wrist.My friends tell me that their watches (not from Amazon) came with two sizes of bands.  Wish mine had."
375,Nice
376,"My series 3 watch was showing its age. I finally broke down and replaced it with this. It’s a huge upgrade to my series 3 and for considerably less than a series 8. I can’t complain, I knew I was giving up some features to the 8 but I couldn’t justify the extra expense. I love my SE."
377,"My husband bought me this for Christmas to replace my second gen, which was 8 years old. Not much difference in style, face is a little larger. Synced with my iPhone easily and so many more functions. Truly a computer on your wrist. Easy to personalize to your style, you can use photos as your wallpaper."
378,"Apple why wouldn't you include an adapter with watch?  You should list, it not including adapter a must purchase."
379,"Product would not connect to IPhone 12, took to apple with no luck, returned to sender, will try again!"
380,"Bought as a gift and they loved it. We set everything up very quickly, app makes it super easy. The color is stunning and face is easy to read. I don’t know about battery life but Apples are all about the same. Do more things wear down battery quicker. Nice watch."
381,"The Apple Watch SE is great, considering it can do most of the things the higher tier watches (like the Series 7 & 8) can do for this price, especially when you consider that this watch has almost the same specs as the Series 8. You don’t miss out on too much except for the ability to see your blood oxygen and ECG, along with temperature sensing and an always-on display. In other words, if those features don’t matter that much to you, this could be your best choice for your wallet."
382,Had to return.  They wanted me to purchase a more expensive watch.
383,Bought it for my wife as she wanted it for her birthday. I don't think any Apple item is worth the price they charge.
384,The watch has great features but battery life is poor. I guess that’s a trade-off.
385,"I had a Fitbit, which I enjoyed, but I wanted to upgrade to an Apple Watch. I love this watch! It does so much more than my Fitbit. My favorite thing is being able to take a phone call from it so my hands are free!"
386,Love the watch I never knew I really needed it. It’s fast battery life is great.
387,"The reason I wanted an Apple Watch was mainly for the fall detection as I live alone, and I fell a few weeks ago in my back bedroom and luckily I wasn’t injured and I was able to get up but while I laid there on the floor it dawned on me, what if I couldn’t get up. So that’s when I decided I needed to invest in an Apple Watch because it has the fall detection, I can make a call and have someone come over to help me. It’s just a great thing to have as it gives me a feeling of security since I live alone."
388,Love it
389,"I ordered 2 watches but when I ordered the second one I also ordered a usb charger. Turned out the charger included with the watch doesn’t work. I plugged it in to my computer, my phone, and my flashlight. Nothing worked. The usb charger worked perfectly"
390,Todo el color es hermoso
391,"Apple is too cheap to add a special USB-C charging block to their packaging, so buy one Separately, or you will have the same type of Christmas I did. No one deserves that. Asinine apple.  I’m giving most of this five stars because this is an Amazon bought product.  And Amazon does not deserve the rating of one star Apple does."
392,Band can’t fit my wrist!
393,The SE is a great option. It has a lot of the utility of a smart watch for a great deal. This is quite useful for a student aged wearer.
394,I purchased this I watch to replace my previous one which the face had separated and it this cost the same as fixing the old oneLove it!
395,I bought this just because my old one died.  BUT IT SAVED my life.  I was taking my dogs for a walk.  They got over excited about saying hi to some neighbors and pulled me down.  I blacked out for a second but came to when my watch started ringing and sent a message that it detected a fall and wanted to know if it should call 911.  I love this watch and will not leave the house without it.
396,This is about the same size as my 3 however the type and face font is larger and more user friendly. I love the settings and the new modular face watch.  works great no complaints.
397,Great overall watch!
398,Delivery was as promised. My wife loves her new watch.
399,"It's clean, beautiful, and practical. I'm in love with it. Battery life is not excellent but makes it through 1 day and a half."
400,I bought it because I used to have a Fitbit watch but hated plugging it in each night. This Apple Watch I purchased a stand to hold and charge my phone and watch together easily each night. It’s fantastic for my needs.
401,"Was debating the SE gen. 2 or the Series 8, and truly, aside of being aluminum instead of stainless steel, and lacking a pulse oximeter, this is the BEST! The price is more competitive and the features are incredible. Beats the Series 3 I've had for 4 years without a doubt, would highly recommend this over the Series 8 at this price. Using recycled materials to make this is a plus as well."
402,
403,"Es un Apple Watch SE GPS nuevo 2022.muy fácil de usar con la aplicación del iPhone.Tiene un buen tamaño puesto en mi muñeca .me gusta mucho mi reloj ya que puedo controlar mensajes ,llamadas y muchas aplicaciones mas por mi reloj."
404,Bought for my step daughter she loves it.
405,Perfect for my needs
406,"She had wanted a fitbit… i researched both and apparently made the perfect decision by getting the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen! She loves it. Gets challenged to exercise every day, found her phone in no time, etc! Thank you!"
407,I bought 2 .. one for me and my lady. They’re AWESOME! The price is great and the these new SE models are excellent! I wear mine everyday!
408,"It’s my first Apple Watch. I always brought the cheaper sports watches. I love all the features. The only downside I’ve noticed is the battery life doesn’t last long. Also you need to buy a power adapter, it doesn’t come with one. But other than that I’m happy with my purchase."
409,"This beautiful watch is locked and, therefore, not usable."
410,Purchased this watch for my spouse and they love it so far. They’ve only had it for about a week and a half but hopefully it continues to be a good product for them.
411,It was a gift. I wear it to get time of day. If you like gadgets it’s intetestimg if one has time to play. Wasn’t expensive and works for me.
412,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I love how simple the SE watch is. I have the 45mm and can’t say nothing but great things about it. I have had no issues, lagging or problems. I don’t think people need the Series 8 over this - but it all depends on your fitness and life goals."
413,Tiny but convenient. The 44mm would be too big so we got the 40mm. We have small wrists. My all black one isn’t home yet since it was not in stock but my wife absolutely loves hers.
414,"much appreciated no hassles, exactly what I ordered and perfect condition as advertised."
415,It’s unfortunate that they didn’t state it worked with iPhone 8 or newer.  Wasted everyone’s time.
416,I’m 66 years old & I had no problem setting it up. Currently have a pix of my granddaughter as my watch face
417,"Although I'm a die hard android user,  my daughter is equally due hard Apple products. She is over the moon in love with her watch."
418,First Apple watch for the wife. Didn't want to spend a fortune before I knew if she would like it. She loves it and it does most of the things the new expensive ones do.
419,I bought this in 40mm with a midnight sport band. Clearly said midnight sport band however it came with a blue grayish sports band strap. The weird thing is that the case read midnight sport band but still didn’t have it. Oh and i bought 2 of them as well.
420,"Bought this to replace a older version from 5 years ago, not sure what has been upgraded. It seems like the same watch with no changes. Now I have 2."
421,Thought she would never really go for such a thing but she uses it daily and lives it.
422,The battery life in this Apple Watch is honestly the best! I would totally recommend this Apple Watch in particular.
423,Works great. My husband loves it. I have one too and it love it.
424,The watch works perfectly fine. I am in love with it. I highly recommend
425,"The Apple Watch is amazing! Can’t stop recommending this watch. The only small thing that kind of sucks is the battery life. I have to charge it almost everyday. I work intensely for almost 12hrs per day, so I like to keep tracking of the amount of steps I walk per day. However, I couldn’t finish the 12hrs because the battery lasts around 10hrs if you turn the power-saving mode around 50%."
426,Bought this for my bride for Christmas. She never asked for one and didn’t think she wanted one but absolutely loves it. Great gift for anyone with an iPhone.
427,My son has several watches. Wears this one daily.
428,Love my watch it keeps track of everything.
429,"Got this for my wife, who uses an iPhone. It feels very solidly made, with nothing aesthetically standing out as an imperfection. The watch seems snappy, with a good easy to use interface. The only complaint she's had is that the speech to text recognition is awful, and I've seen a number of posts online with the same complaint and it seems to be consistent across all apple devices? Certainly not a dealbreaker but seems like something that could potentially improve with software updates (if they get to it)."
430,Great
431,They have yet to re fund my money. U returned this item a month ago and have not received my money back and to be honest Amazon is not helping at all i am kinda pissed off.This came fast never opened the box because I ordered the wrong watch as it didn't have cellular only gps
432,Awsome gift he loves it
433,The Apple Watch comes on time for my wife Christmas gift. It is not unbox yet. I love the Apple Watch Se. the series 8 has much health care which she does not need. So I think SE should be the best for her.
434,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Me encanto mi Apple Watch..tengo experiencia porque tenía un serie 3 pero este SE evidentemente es mejor en cuanto configuración,pantalla etc. Es totalmente nuevo con batería en 100 de capacidad.. Estoy satisfecha tNto con mi paquete q con elEnvío,el cual fue maravilloso por la amabilidad del driver y la rapidez delmismo"
435,"Its exactly as pictured, came brand new in the apple box. Charger was included! It was easy to connect it to my phone and it has all the apps I need! I absolutely love it, its great for working out and its waterproof like it says. I highly recommend this watch! I just recently purchased some screen protectors for it to prevent scratching it too (bc I’m clumsy) But definitely worth the investment if you’re thinking about getting an Apple Watch!"
436,This watch is awesome and simple to use right out of the box. I love the features. It’s comfortable and has unlimited potential.
437,Great for the price ! Works just as well as the other series! Love it
438,Exactly what my mom wanted!
439,Battery lasts days. Came in so quick! I’m in love with this series!
440,"I absolutely love this watch.  As a person that has had a couple of Fitbit & loved them but wanted more features, this is terrific.  This watch has so much for & as a senior, I also wanted fall detection which this has.  I got another fall detection watch that was hard to use & lacking all the fitness features. This combines the best of health, fitness & safety. A good price point since I can’t afford the more expensive Apple watches."
441,"Believe it or not, I replaced my apple watch 1 with this model. This one's (SE2) screen is a bit larger but not by much. In my opinion these watches are well worth the money. BTW get a screen cover."
442,My daughter is very happy with this item. No complaints.
443,Works well
444,Perfecto en su caja como tal
445,The SE has almost all the features of the Apple Watch 8 at a fraction of the price.
446,I'm not a techno guy.  Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Said it worked with the iPhone SE.  Problem was her phone was a first gen iPhone SE.  Obviously we needed to upgrade phones so we did that.  But the watch needs charged just about every day.  Very disappointed in battery life.
447,Bien
448,Awesome Cyber Monday find! My son was shocked & loves it! Great quality.
449,"It was a gift, she loves it."
450,Family loves everything about Apple Watch.
451,Bought it for my son. He loves it.
452,Liked the product and offered price and it works fine and easy to connect
453,I love my new Apple Watch its so convenient running everything I need on it from my wrist. The battery life is the only think I’d criticize it really only lasts 30 hours or so it needs to be charged daily pretty much
454,"I'm only giving this part starts. It does make me very mad I go to set up watch and Apple gives you a cord but no way to charge the phone. The plug you need is their newest plug. Come on Apple, Jobs would be ashamed of you. I have to now drive over 30 miles to get a plug"
455,Complicated set up. Difficult to find instruction manual on internet.
456,"Excellent product, easy to use, delivered quickly. Nice."
457,"Tal y como en las fotos, producto original de la Apple."
458,It is easy to set up and use I have very small wrists and it doesn’t look big on my arm .
459,"Was a tad skeptical ordering an Apple product on Amazon, however I did my DD and checked the page to make sure it was Apple and it is. Got here far quicker than ordering from Apple or my local shops too."
460,I needed a new watch and this works out great. The battery needs to be charged often but overall a great buy.
461,Just what I had expected. Good packaging and new
462,"I wanted to buy a watch that my daughter could use to contact me. After reading reviews and doing the research, I STILL managed to buy the incorrect watch. This watch does not have an IMEI number. It is confusing because it advertises the family sharing option. This watch can only be paired with an iphone and cannot be used as a separate device. BEWARE"
463,Love the quality. Great product.
464,Easy yo use
465,The product worked well for the grandson.
466,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It was delivered super fast thanks"
467,great watch
468,Love the apple watch!
469,"Excelente producto, lo recomiendo"
470,Like it so far. Just start using so am not sure about battery life
471,"Loved it , but would not pair with my 7+ phone"
472,Did not have Alexa no ekg for heart no oxygen have to purchase app to 9.99 month
473,Simplemente perfecto!
474,Its much better than my old series 3. No issues here. Great experience with seller
475,"I love the watch, it's super useful and easy to use, plus it motivates you to be on the move. My only problem is that the strap barely closes and I will have to buy another one so that my wrist does not continue to suffer. I was hoping it would be bigger or have more holes."
476,Got this for my boyfriend's birthday. He loves it. Wears it everyday and it's super useful
477,So far it’s working well and I’m pleased. Definitely a good compromise price wise if you don’t need the blood oxygen level or body temperature options that the series 8 has.I’ll update if anything changes or if it quits working as it should.
478,"Iba a comprarlo en apple directamente , me compre el de 44mm, en apple me costaba aprox 310 dólares, aquí me costo 239 porque le bajaron el precio. Es completamente original, viene todo sellado, es nuevo. 100% RECOMENDADO"
479,"Delivery was very effecient and the Apple Watch lives up to the quality which we have become accustomed too. In my opinion, it's the best smart watch on the market, especially when paired with an apple watch."
480,"I bought the ""very good"" condition of this watch and it looks almost brand new. There is only a scratch on the corner but otherwise the watch looks great, it's very unnoticeable. It works perfectly and I've been enjoying using the watch to track my workouts. I'm very impressed by the condition of this watch and I wonder why anyone would get one brand new! The battery life health was at 83%, which is expected from a previously owned watch but it's enough to last me throughout the workday and into the evening. It charges quickly and the charge it came with works great. The band is also comfortable when I wear it at the gym and easy to put on. I would definitely recommend this."
481,"Just received my new watch yesterday &' so far perfection. I was worried cause they had quite a mix of reviews but i took a chance &' I couldn't be happier. When I opened the box everything was in great condition, the watch had no scratches or any real damage that I could find, it really looks brand new, watch band &' charger was in amazing condition as well. I did have to charge it before setting up but that wasn't an issue for me. Once it turned on it took maybe 5 mins to set up &' everything is working perfectly so far. Beyond happy &' definitely worth the money!"
482,"A basic, doesn’t work without my cell close by but totally okay.  I got it for my the password confirm# and so if my phone is in my purse I don’t have to pull it our every time it dings or rings.  Now I can check my watch to see if I want to bother.  I have used it on a phone call and it heard me fine just walking and talking."
483,"The packaging was terrible. It was hardly protected, and the outside casing that I can assume was provided by FedEx(?) was not entirely around the box. I could see the box inside through the terribly packaged folds. Upon opening the box, there were hardly any protective material to provide the watch face any safety. There are scratches on the watch, which I would have hoped would have been cleaned up, as I did purchase a refurbished watch. Other than the poorly packaged watch, it connected successfully and I am experiencing no issues thus far. Another plus, it delivered exceptionally quick. 👍🏽"
484,I received my watch today. It does not come with a USB C adapter. I am unable to plug it in to charge it. They should tell you that so you know you have to order that as well Or better yet include one.  I have never owned an Apple Watch. There is no instructions with the watch. I hope it is easy to set up. I guess I’ll find out in a couple of days after I receive the USB adapter that I just ordered.
485,"Glad I bought it refurbished but even though I’ve turned off a lot of notifications, the battery drains quickly"
486,I love it. It works just like new. There wasn’t any scratches or cracks. It was great quality to be refurbished.
487,"I love this watch, it very useful in situations like school or work, when you need access to communication but can’t have your phone. It accurately tracks exercise and steps. I would definitely recommend, plus it’s pretty cheap for an apple watch."
488,"I love this watch for keeping my steps all day, plus it’s great for when you get a text or call and you’re not near your phone. I also love the fact that you can choose what you want for the face. I have Minnie mouse and she talks cute."
489,"This is my first time owning an Apple Watch, and I really love it.  I had to give it 5 stars for being a great watch, and the fact that I can use most of my apps without pulling out my phone.  I like the watch faces, however would have a few suggestions there.  What I don't like is the fitness app, and that's not the watch's fault.  I had a Fitbit Versa and the fitness tracking was awesome.  The Apple Fitness App is lacking compared to Fitbit.  It doesn't even count stairs, although it has ""Flights"" listed.  Apple could learn from Fitbit in my opinion.This watch is renewed, and you can't tell.  It looks brand new.  I'll up date in a few months, but for now I am happy with this purchase.edit:  Getting used to the Apple Fitness App.  Still miss seeing steps and stairs.  Rings are growing on me."
490,Great for a refurbished watch
491,Es usado? Puedo asegurar que no venia con ninguna raya. La batería está al 100%. Funciona excelente y vino con su cargador más todos los accesorios de las correas. Estoy contento con la compra. Saludos
492,I just got it! I was really surprised! I thought my watch would have been with more imperfections but it looks really good! Just a minor scratch on top! Didn’t come with original Apple band! Really good with the price !
493,"First I was hesitant to buy it, because it says ""Renewed."" But I was mistaken. THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE, and I am happy I made the decision to buy it. Comes nicely packaged, perfectly clean, and actually it looks and feels brand new. The price is really affordable. Want to say this is my first time buying an Apple watch, I have transitioned from Samsung to Apple (phone and watch) and again, I made a great choice and purchase. I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!"
494,"Llego en su caja original, funcionamiento todo ok. Estéticamente todo ok"
495,"I was hesitant to purchase as I had bought a ""refurb"" Apple Watch previously, however, this one is a MUST BUY! The previous version I had purchased had battery issues and would not last through a day. The battery on this lasts at least a day and a half with heavy use. I receive messages via MS Teams all day at work, workout, and walk a ton for my job. Apple fitness is a game changer and beats any fitness app i've used. Provides simple information and goals to strive for. Thoroughly satisfied with my purchase!"
496,I bought this watch fully knowing it was refurbished. The watch itself works great but has a decently sized noticeable scratch that kinda drives me crazy. Just remember you get what you pay for!
497,The Product Arrived On Time! Product Was In Excellent Condition! Product Came With Everything!
498,"Great deal for a quality product. No scratches, looked brand new. Battery life is great, can usually use for 2 days without charging depending on amount of use."
499,"it came with the charger, the apple watch, and the band. i use mine everyday and recommend for working out ! i like that it counts my steps accurately"
500,I use this everyday! No issue noted!
501,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I’m very satisfied with my purchase. I got it as (good) and their is a tiny dent at the bottom left corner you can’t even notice or see that it’s their. Now the battery health is at 98% that great because the watch will do well. But it the battery seems to not last long. But it’s okay I’m not complaining I love this Apple Watch it’s a great choice I picked."
502,"Product was what we expected, but we would like to return the item and get a cellular version of the Apple Watch so that we can use it with our telephones and avoid a monthly fee with our carrier"
503,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Llegó mucho antes de la fecha acordada, está en excelentes condiciones, no tiene ningún altercado a nivel visual, esta completamente utilizable, no tiene un ID anterior ni ningún problema de ID, la condición de la batería está intacta. Las bandas están excelentes. Excelente compra."
504,No complaints. Great watch.
505,For a renewed watch it works fine and so far connected fine. So thank you very much.
506,Honestly 10/10 love the watch. A few minor scratches on the back but it’s in great condition. Very happy.
507,I upgraded from a series 3.  I loved my old watch and when it quit working I upgraded to this.  The screen is a little touchy and it doesn’t always register when I try to tap to unlock it or open apps.
508,"This watch looks brand new, the screen has no scratches or scuffs. It works perfectly and the band is brand new. It arrived much sooner than I expected. Very happy with this purchase."
509,"Literally, perfect. Screen is still in perfect condition, charger works as it should, lifetime battery says 98%, took no time at all to link up with my phone, and SO MUCH cheaper than buying brand new. If you’re on the fence about this, just get it. You’ll thank yourself. Also, obsessed with all the bands I’ve found on Amazon too 😍"
510,Bought this for my 13 year old for Christmas. She was super happy with it. I was happy it came in an OEM box and looked like brand new!
511,This is my very first Apple Watch. I really like it. The only thing is it came with many scratches and one gouge. I was very excited to receive it and immediately started learning all about it. The next day I then realized I should of contacted the company and let them know of the scratches but by that time I had invested my time and info into the Watch. I honestly did not want to start all over. That was my only reason for not contacting the company to send it back. Lesson learned. All in all I love the color and it’s performance. The battery only lasts me for a day.
512,"It has all of the features that I need that my Watch many years ago did not. My last one was new, but refurbished is fine. Especially due to the difference in cost.What I am hoping to find online is a way to have the Battery last longer.For now, I’m going to wear it when I need to the most, so can charge as necessary.I DO know that Bluetooth drains battery. I’m going to try to remove apps that I don’t want right now to see how much that helps."
513,Looks new and pretty but requires constant charging. I have to charge overnight to make it lasts the whole day.
514,"I'm not sure why I waited to get an Apple watch to go with my other Apple products... maybe the price. This refurbished has been perfect. I could live with the price. It's been dependable. And it's made receiving messages so convenient. I don't sleep with it on because I don't want to ""feel"" the notifications. So the battery life has been a non-issue. I charge it at night though it's rarely below about 65%. I'm very happy I finally got one and got this one. (I have a tiny wrist, so I had to buy a stretchable replacement band, as this one was too big and the watch was not against my wrist.)"
515,Great Watch
516,"I am really impressed with this refurbished Apple Watch SE. I had been idly considering purchasing an Apple Watch for a year and when I saw this, I jumped on it even though I saw the SCATHING reviews regarding the battery life.REGARDING THE BATTERY LIFE:I found that right out of the box, the Apple Watch *did not* preform with the battery life as advertised. It only lasted about 3-4 hours fully charged.HOWEVER, after going through and TURNING OFF background app refresh and other background processes, as well as REMOVING UNNECESSARY APPS, the BATTERY LIFE IMPROVED DRASTICALLY. It has NOT EVEN hit 75% after a FULL 8 HOURS. I think the battery life is really impressive!COSMETICALLY:This watch is in REALLY GOOD condition considering it is secondhand/refurbished. I received mine with only ONE TINY CHIP to the screen.**I genuinely think this is not a watch to pass up. If you’re considering it, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going through all of the apps that come on it and remove unnecessary ones as well as turning off any background processes. That should improve battery life amazingly.**Thank you!"
517,"I bought the excellent condition refurbished SE and it came quickly in the mail, but it was free-floating in a small FedEx box(there wasn’t even bubble wrap around the actual watch piece), leaving a ton of opportunities for damage to occur. I saw some people received there’s in the original apple box, but that wasn’t the case for me. It arrived completely dead and not fully updated, which was simple to deal with but just a little bit of an inconvenience. On the plus side, the battery capacity was at 100%, which is great for a refurbished piece, maybe they replaced the battery. The glass screen of my watch also has a fairly large scratch on it, which was disappointing because I paid the extra money for “excellent condition”, and I personally wouldn’t consider it excellent. My watch didn’t come with the user manual, which I solved by just using the apple store website, but it would’ve been nice to have.Overall, this is a great option to save money but be weary of how it ships, I definitely think this store should invest in better shipping products (so that they aren’t liable for damage during shipping when the product was maybe in perfect condition before it was sent out)! The watch works fine and has great battery health, just a bit upset about the scratch since I paid for the excellent condition."
518,"Overall the watch is great. It looks new and works great. Only reason I gave it three stars was because the battery is horrible. I fully charged it when I received it. Only wore the watch 4 hours and barley used it and when I got home my battery was at 20%. Now I have to purchase a new battery , which I should not have to do seeing as I just bought this watch a couple days ago."
519,"40mm is a little small but some people have preferences. anyways, it works just as if it was brand new. very cutsie pootsie"
520,Such a perfect buy! Nothing was wrong and it was great! 100% recommend I ended up buying one for my mom
521,Watch works great and has a good battery life. sometimes i can’t respond to messages through the watch but everything else works amazing.
522,"I bought this Apple Watch for my son. So far it works fine, the charger that was sent for it seemed cheap but he used his old charger. The battery health is at 90% capacity when sent. The other thing is I bought this one thinking GPS meant you can use Apple Maps without wifi, it just means u can track you’re distance during workouts or whatnot. I would recommend."
523,I bought this Apple Watch SE and I just got it yesterday and I have already updated the watch but after it was already done updating I started to set it up and it would reach the sharing screen but goes right back to this screen . Can someone help me on how to complete the set up on the watch
524,Got this for my mother. She loves it. However the band that came with it came broken
525,"The Apple Watch itself works great, however my only complaint is that the wrist band, charger, and box aren’t the ones like in the review. They’re more cheaper and the wrist band is a cheap one not the official wrist band."
526,"I have yet to get it completely set up but so far this watch has done well. It charged quickly but does not fit my wrist. I’m not sure what size the band is, but if you have small wrists it will not fit."
527,"I'm enjoying my refurbished Apple Watch.  My only complaint is that the battery life is only around 20hrs.  I'd like to wear it to track my sleep but then I wouldn't be able to wear it the next day without having it charge for an hour or so.But other than that, I'm enjoying it."
528,"So far, I am really enjoying the watch.  The only problems have been operator error;  once I read the manual, I'm good to go.  But, can't figure out how to track my steps throughout the day"
529,i did not like to get this and have no way to charge the darn thing.  a Regular usb cord and not a c cord to charge. really  just spent $200 and no way to chargeit.  very disappointed.
530,"My original Apple Watch 3 broke after 5 years so I had to get a new one. Couldn’t justify the price, but this referb was excellent. Looks and works like brand new! I got a second one for my husband. His is perfect too."
531,"Battery does not last long and takes a while to charge; not allowing me to wear it over night to track my sleep. Also, the band it came with is more grey than it is white. Minor detail, but I was hoping for a lighter color"
532,"I was very surprised and pleased with this watch. I have used it in swim workouts, and it has worked wonderfully. I like the size of the screen and have had no issues so far. Band is comfortable. I haven't used the sleep tracker yet, so I can't review that honestly. Watch came in a weird box, but besides that, I am very pleased with this purchase."
533,"Watch is great, app is great. But beware, the charger over heats and becomes too hot to touch. I tried with several different boxes and outlets and within 5 minutes the charger was super hot. I forgot my watch on their and 30 minutes later it was too hot that it wouldn’t turn on."
534,Apesar de que es Reacondicionado es un excelente relok
535,"I just received my watch in the mail yesterday and so far it looks brand new in all new packaging. However, the band was clear that it was not an Apple product and it came broken. I can't use it with a spring being broken in the band so it will not insert at all. This is a bummer for sure. But overall, I would say it was worth the money so far."
536,Got it for my wife for Christmas. She loves it . It does not look refurbished. Still in plastic with original pieces included . Great buy!!
537,A nice refurbished watch
538,Used religiously since purchase (not very long ago) and now the battery won't charge past 80% anymore and dies very very quickly.
539,Great watch for the price. I didn’t need it to be cellular. Fast delivery too. Once I figured stuff out the battery life has been great. (Was on it a lot when I first got it)
540,The watch is great. Does what it needs to do. BUT the battery is absolutely trash. Took forever to get to a full charge but then died after 3 HOURS. Im so mad.***update*** so i ended up updating the watch and it works just fine.
541,Works great! Needs to come with cube for the charging cord.
542,"Only have had 3 days, but so far it's great!But, the cute pink watchband broke right away.  The little metal piece over the spring fell off, so I had to buy another band at walmart. Wish it had come with the written 90-day warranty"
543,"Overall I was fairly happy with my purchase even though I selected excellent condition, I would say the watch came in in good condition. Definitely scratches on the screen that were very light and two spots on the outside of the watch where it was rubbed up against something, definitely can see some of this minor damage, holding it out at arms length. However, for the price I think it was well worth it, as for some of the minor damage nothing that a screen protector couldn’t cover up."
544,Came just as promised! Everything works perfectly I’m glad i made the purchase
545,Works great. My husband who was completely against it is in love.
546,"I was a little worried buying this refurbished but it showed up without any issues, clean, good condition and with a power supply (minus the wall plug). Standard setup; we were able to search for instructions online and it's been working great for the last 2 months"
547,So far the watch works great.  I was disappointed the watch band was gray vs white as advertised… but not returning because of the color of the band.
548,"After a few years of wanting this watch, I went for it when I saw this great price.The watch looks pristine and the battery life is excellent.At time of writing (September 2022), you can have offline Spotify, and Apple now provides estimated vo2 max, and heart zone training alerts - in addition to the normal sleep tracking, run tracking, and so on.What an awesome fitness accessory, a great $180 spent."
549,Por el precio está muy bienEs preciso en los recorridos de ejercicio
550,"I bought this as an upgrade from my FitBit.It not only works with Apple Health but also with Lose-It which I use for tracking nutrition, sleep and exercise.It’s easy to set up and use. I do pop it onto the charging stand every night so I’ve never experienced any battery life issues, but I did go several days in a row without charging when I first hot it; again no problems.It is synced with my iPhone so I never miss a text, event or call.It reminds me to stand, move, and exercise (it did that just now!).My only complaint is that the large watchband included with the watch is not large enough. The watch band vendors, including Apple, seem to think that people who buy 40mm watches have small wrists.If your wrist is over 8” in circumference and you want a iWatch SE, buy the 44mm iwatch.This is a good, helpful, well-performing device.I recommend it."
551,Good value and arrived early than expected.
552,A scratch here and there but overall not bad for the price
553,"I bought this refurbished on February 25, 2022, it’s now March 12th and so far I have absolutely NO COMPLAINTS! This is my first Apple Watch ever. There are some minor scratches on the screen but like I said it’s refurbished. The band color was more purple than a pinkish color that the picture looks like. Honestly I’d buy it again though.*UPDATE* Here it is July 1st and I still love my watch! I just figured out it can get wet and it works fine getting it wet (in the shower or sprinkler). I haven’t swam with it yet.Only complain is occasionally it does freeze up and zoom in I usually press and hold both buttons and just reset it and have no more issues once it turns back on! I am completely satisfied with this purchase still! It takes calls just fine. Texts greats. Tracks great! I love it!"
554,"First time buying a refurbished piece of tech.  So far, so good.  Watch came on time.  No fancy packaging but all parts were there.  No scratches and it works great.  This is my first Apple Watch so I did not want to spend a ton on money and the SE does everything I need it to do.  Love not having to dig out my phone every time I get a text, to check on email and even to answer the phone.  Also love recording my workouts on it."
555,Works as advertised. My product was just like new
556,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It was easy to put together. It was easy to set it up. It is definitely worth the money. It’s great value for the money that you pay for for the watch. I have the iPhone SE so I wanted the Apple Watch SE to go with it and it looks great thank you Amazon for this product."
557,"Product came in looking brand new.  No scratches or even dust on the watch itself, and the battery has 100% of its life.  The watch was updated to WatchOS 8.6, so after updating to 8.8(current at time of writing), the watch worked as expected.  I’m upgrading from a FitBit Blaze, and it is a massive upgrade.  Only came with S/M bands, which barely fit my wrist, but other than that it is perfect.  Also, it includes a USB-C charger, rather than a USB-A so keep that in mind when buying."
558,"Wrong color, strap is gray actually. Otherwise everything is as expected. Working great"
559,Love it perfect
560,Absolutely love this watch and so glad I didn’t have to pay a lot for it! It came in the normal packaging and everything is in perfect condition. So so happy with it. Originally I was nervous because it seemed like the battery life wasn’t very good but after a full charge it lasts a long time.
561,Forget the others...this is what you want IF you have an iphone
562,"Slow touchscreen responseAir bubbles on the screenThe frame covers up text and graphics (yes, I did go into text size to adjust and this did not correct the problem)I contacted the seller four days ago and have not received a response."
563,Works perfectly
564,Worth the value! I have used this every day and its still working great 4 months down the line.
565,"So I’ve read multiple reviews about how it was iCloud activation locked, but when I got mine it worked perfectly with no trouble at all now I haven’t tested the battery but at this point In time I believe that it will last two days, only reason I’m giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because I received the band box and the Apple Watch box without the main box that holds them together, the packaging  for both boxes looked excellent, but as soon as I opened it the packaging looked ripped, I’m pretty sure Renewed Apple watches need to be sealed back up to ensure quality, but it’s whatever I got a perfect band, and almost brand new Apple Watch considering it’s been used!!!"
566,"Estaba un poco dudoso de lo que iba a recibir ya que mi primera orden fue cancelada pero pude recibir un reemplazo, sin embargo, el Apple Watch llegó antes de la fecha estimada, con todos sus accesorios y caja original, y aparte tiene cobertura por garantía de Apple hasta julio del otro año! La mejor compra que pude haber hecho definitivamente."
567,Me gusto bastante pero si se demora muchísimo en actualizarse pero hsta el momento todo lo demás funciona increíble
568,"I love my watch!! It stays charged all day and I only have to put it on charger at night when I go to sleep. It’s great for sending quick texts while doing other tasks. I also love that it counts my steps and tracks how long I’ve walked. I can also talk on the watch, which is great for my busy life! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"
569,I thought I was buying a GPS + cellular watch but it was only GPS.  I bought a blue band but it came with a white band.The company did disappoint with these details but the watch is in great working order. I decided to keep it for myself instead of for my daughter and am satisfied with it.
570,"I went from the Apple Watch 3 to the SE version, and it’s absolutely perfect. I didn’t need the GPS or extra things that come with the 7 so this was the clear option. Works very well, battery could be better but if you turn off the heart rate it wll last more than 24/hrs"
571,"The watch came as expected with only a few tiny scratches, barely noticeable. After about a month of daily use, I believe the Apple Watch SE is a good fit for most people who just want a reliable watch with fitness tracking, notifications, and Apple Pay. I haven't found myself desiring the more advanced features of the newer Apple Watches. For the price, the SE is well worth it."
572,Watch face is in new like condition and it came with a new looking cord but in a plain cardboard  box not an apple box like I was hoping for. Works fine battery life is ok a little less than my other watch.
573,My son loved it
574,This watch came in a generic box but the watch itself has no deficiency. Keeping up with her daily activities. She is able to download most of the apps. I am glad that i made this purchase for her.
575,It would've been nice to have the charging adapter so that I could charge this so that I could set it up so that I could actually use it.  Had to spend another $19 just to even see if it works.
576,I was nervous about ordering from the seller because of some of the reviews but honestly I love this watch it came in the original packaging with the original charger and bands ! I was in such awe that this was legit being like I said some of the reviews stated the box was empty or damaged but nope I received a very real very new Apple Watch ! Thank you guys !
577,This refurbished Apple watch was packaged with such care and arrived quickly from the seller. All was in working order with no scratches as promised. I’d definitely buy from them again!
578,"I’m not super particular about most things, but this is kind of unacceptable. The watch came in (it seems fine and looks like it will probably work just as well), but all the accessories and what not we’re just chucked in the box and not where they should be. I understand that it’s refurbished/used and everything, but I expected better from an Amazon choice."
579,"This was a birthday present, the watch was as clean as new, very minor scuffs that are only there if you’re actually looking for them. Battery so far is good, responsive and crystal clean screen. Other than not getting the full “butterfly packing” unboxing experience it was definitely worth the purchase. I should add that this isn’t new so I purchased the 3 year protection plan with it for the long term"
580,Product very clean and almost brand new. Updated the watch like suggested but the battery still seems to drain really fast.My last watch lasted at least 2 days and I’m lucky if I get through a day (not including night) on one charge.
581,"Lo llevo usando algunos meses y es excelente, mejor de lo que pensaba. En el empaque llegó como nuevo, no parecía renewed, lo uso sobretodo para medir mi rendimiento en el agua y funciona Perfecto."
582,my daughter wears this on schooltime mode during the day yet when she gets home from school it only has like 20% battery life.  constantly  have to charge it.  poor battery life.
583,First time i ordered it it was locked. I messaged the seller and they got me a new one. Works perfectly fine. No complaints with the new one.
584,
585,"FYI You need iPhone and a wall charger, but I knew that going in.I received the package fast and secured. I had to charge the watch for 30 minutes before syncing it with my phone. The battery works great and I got great use out of it on the first day! It came with two bands of different sizes and it works great. I did have to turn off the zoom setting on the watch. Overall 10/10 experience. I love all the information that comes with it about how it's a refreshed or refurbished item and its warranty. Thank you so much!"
586,"I love this watch. Did not come with any directions, but after charging was very easy to figure out."
587,"Best purchase in a long time, the apple watch just look like a brand new one, no scratches at all, came in a original apple box, 100% battery life and ready to link to your apple ID, works perfectly after 1 month, and just $199 for SE model with free shipping."
588,"Visiblemente excelente, como nuevo, la batería al 100 %"
589,I liked that the watch looks and fell like new. Battery was great.It came with a very short charging cable and the magnet was not strong enough. Also the watch band only came in medium size.I returned mine because of these issues.
590,"Ordered the one with the abyss blue band, but instead they sent a white. They don't even show a white-banded one on their listing so I don't know what's up with that. Otherwise it's absolutely fine: 90% battery health, a few minor blemishes on the back of the casing (which are invisible when wearing), and no conspicuous issues with the hardware or software."
591,I hated it because the battery drained so fast and I thought it might even be defective. I looked up a lot of guides on turning off certain settings that aren't important to me and my battery lasts a whole day even with a workout now.
592,The product looked new and is functioning as it should. The price was right!
593,"I was worried that bc it was a renewed product I wasn’t going to be satisfied. That it would perform at lower quality than new. I was wrong, it was in perfect condition it has held the battery life and works great. Very happy with my decision to buy renewed."
594,I can’t believe it took fedex three missed reports to get it but it was worth it
595,Loved it! It is a like new item🤍
596,love getting calls on my watch
597,"The screen of the Watch dips on one side. This makes the touch sensitivity unreliable. Either it will not register the touch, or it will activate buttons on the other side of the screen. Everything else is in perfect condition."
598,I was skeptical about a refurbished purchase but the watch is like new. I couldn’t even tell that it was pre owned
599,Great value for the money. I upgraded from a very basic Apple Watch to this one and I am very happy with it.
600,Thought the handwashing feature would be cool but it does not detect when you washing your hands.
601,Got it for my son's birthday and he loves it
602,"here in my country the same watch is around 450 usd, here I bought mine for 197 usd with 100% battery life. Basically new. Love it"
603,"The watch overall is great the only concern that I have is when it get hot when it’s changing, it will not charge"
604,So I really got into fitness this past year(COVID got me to finally look in the mirror) and I was curious about getting an Apple Watch. I finally got this one and so far it’s been great! I like all the data and added insight into my exercises and health. I appreciate the ease of setting it up and being able to leave my phone at the house while I go for a run. The alarm wakes me up better than my noise phone alarm. I haven’t used it that long but the Spotify app and my workout apps all integrate with it quite well. My only issue is that the wrist band it came with was too small for me. Condition was like new!
605,The charger I received in the package does not work. I ordered an original charger from Apple for 30 dollars. I wish to get refunded for the missing parts.
606,"So happy with this purchase. I feel like I got more bang for my buck, the quality is like brand new, you would never know it was refurbished."
607,"Received very quickly, satisfied with shipping. However, the box was shoved into a FedEx envelope when it should not have been and I’m lucky it was not damaged. Upon opening, I thought it would be refurbished within an apple box and instead it was in a cheap box with cheap packaging. There are no instructions included besides needing to unpair - which I don’t because I just bought this. The watch was also 100% dead upon arrival and will probably take a while to charge before set up. I’m a little disappointed and I haven’t even gotten started."
608,"i bought this because i lost my apple watch. i did not want to spend a crazy amount of money and read the reviews thinking it was a good idea! apple watch was locked! contacted seller but they couldn’t do anything. also the bands for this watch are so cheap and do not fit correctly…..so i went to best buy to buy the same exact watch which i should’ve just done in the first place. definitely don’t waste your money just go somewhere reputable like the apple store, your phone carrier or any electronic retail store that has good standing! honestly very frustrating because amazon should be a trustworthy place to buy things……"
609,"i liked everything! the battery life is great, the mobile set up was amazing and it’s very easy to configure, all around a great product for the low price!"
610,"Everything worked well, even though it was refurbished."
611,This arrived in original Apple Watch packaging. Screen and watch is completely flawless. Works like a dream. I’m so happy I purchased this! You can not tell at all that it’s refurbished
612,There is nothing to dislike and I'm 74 and really want perfection when I spend money.
613,The battery only lasted about 5 hours so I had to return the watch unfortunately.
614,"I’m very happy with my purchase, the Apple Watch didn’t come in the original box but all the accessories were original. It didn’t have any scratches, battery life was 100%. Unfortunately, I had an error because I couldn’t activate the watch using my phone, it said “Unable to Check for Updates” but I went to an Apple Store and they kindly help me to solve and it works perfectly now. The product is literally new and it helped me save a couple of dollars. I would totally recommend buying Amazon renewed products, it worths the price."
615,"I bought this watch refurbished, it is excellent. I have nothing negative to say. I wear it everyday."
616,"Basic,  not much to it"
617,This was a gift for my grand daughter. All was good  but delivery did not adhere to instructions
618,Love this watch!!! I was nervous to buy it at first because I’ve never tried the refurbished program but it went swimmingly!
619,The watch I received came pretty much brand new in undamaged separate pieces in bubble wrap. I was able to put it together and pair it with my iPhone easily. The battery capacity is still at 100% after a week. It’s like I got a new Apple Watch SE for almost half the price. Thank you!
620,It’s came in the original box so I liked that it was a little difficult to connect it but I got it. Didn’t come with any scratches or scrapes. It feels good on the hand. Thank you to my aunt for buying it for me as a gift.
621,Item arrived as described so far very good. In original packaging apple was able to get battery charged to 100% no issues or concerns yet- have only had item for 2 days. Great value for $ like new
622,I love it!!! Works excellent. Definitely worth the purchase . :)))
623,I love mine. It’s pretty and functional. Exactly what I need it at affordable price.
624,Battery life was not long lasting and came scratched
625,"I recently purchased the iWatch Series 3. Liked it, but the iWatch SE has better battery life. Most impressive is that everything on screen seems larger- I can read the news, texts,, books etc…I can appreciate being able to see the many features offered by this watch. Easy pairing and transfer of information from the 3. Thank you to all who conceptualize thourgh production to the market."
626,Amazing
627,The Apple Watch SE came in the original packaging. The watch band box had never been opened. The watch was easy to set up and not connected to anyone’s ID as mentioned in previous posts. The battery life is at 100%. The watch itself looked brand new. I added a different band and a protector so I don’t scratch it. All in all this was a great deal and it’s been working great in the week that I’ve had it.
628,"I know this watch is refurbished, but slapping that excellent condition on there, is just not right. I was so excited to receive my watch, but when I got it , there was so many scratches on it, ruining the display. Super sad. Should have spent the extra $ to get a new one. There is also a problem with the screen display internally making the screen look wonky at times. Not worth it. Get the real one not this."
629,Bad battery
630,This is the way to go. Budget friendly and cannot tell the difference between a brand new watch and one of these. Excellent deal.
631,"A Brand new  product, it’s  just amazing!!"
632,i’m am very happy with my apple watch it was very easy to set up i have to admit i was scared when i saw it was refurbished but honestly i would buy electronics refurbished again
633,no scratches yay
634,"Got what we expected, a refurbished watch in good condition, battery life could be better but very happy with price/quality"
635,"I absolutely love this watch. It came in pretty quickly and there was nothing wrong with it. There are no scratches or marks on it and when I fully charge it, it's lasts me 2 days without needing to charge it every night. I've had it for over a month and haven't have a single issue with it. Over all I would definitely recommend."
636,"Haven’t used it much yet, but I anticipate I’ll love it as much as I did the one I lost two years ago. Great price, fast shipping. Arrived a day early."
637,"Yo la verdad me dejé guiar por los buenos comentarios y las fotos, pero desafortunadamente no fue mi caso, la pantalla estaba completamente dañada, eso fue el único problema porque de ahí todo funciona perfectamente. me comuniqué con el vendedor varias veces pero no daba solución y no podía obtener un reemplazo ni nada. En fin sólo comento mi experiencia con este Apple Watch y el vendedor."
638,Love tracking my activity
639,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Works great !"
640,"First time buying anything renewed and I’m pleased!  Everything works as it should.  Battery isn’t as good/long lasting as my sons who’s is brand new, but not a huge difference."
641,Good for value
642,"Works well but the glass has been replaced and you can obviously tell as it’s not flush around the edges. On top of that, the glass is now peeling off. Definitely no swimming with it now or in the future."
643,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Todo me gusto se ve como si fuera nuevo, apenas me llego y ando fascinada 🤩 todo le funciona perfectamente 💯👏"
644,Charged right up and paired with my phone. Tracks activity well. So far so good on the battery life. I’m super impressed and really love it!
645,I’m happy with my watch for the most part but I found it a weird coincidence that right after I set up my watch my Apple ID got hacked. For now on I’ll make sure I only buy brand new apple products
646,Upgraded from 3 and very satisfied with SE!
647,"Bought refurbished 40mm SE. Out of the box it will not charge. Not sure if charger or watch is broken, but they do not work. Attempted to contact seller. Will edit this if they respond."
648,"My wife wanted an Apple Watch after seeing mine, but didn't care about some of the health features. This watch fit the bill and since the SE watch was significantly cheaper than the Series 6, it was a big savings.She loves it, it does everything she needs, and that makes me happy."
649,La batería del Apple Watch dura muy poco
650,"The watch was locked and the previous owner didn’t remove it from their Apple account! Don’t waste your money. It’s really sad, I don’t know if this watch was stolen and resold, but either way, don’t get your money stolen!"
651,"The watch looks like new, no scratches and battery lasts a long time"
652,Meets expectations
653,Bought this renewed and it did indeed come just like new.  Excellent smart watch.  Bought for the wife who wants the fitness capabilities and she is very happy with it - which says a lot because she is pretty hard to please :)
654,i love it !!!
655,Bought for the fit bit side of it. To track health and sleep time for my mom who recently developed health issues and she said it works much better then a fit bit and that she wishes she bought one sooner!
656,I don’t buy renewed often but this was a gift and they did not tell any difference to new! 9.7/10
657,The watch works great but one side of the watch band was damaged so I give this one 🌟 star.  I feel the seller should have fully inspected the watch and the band to insure everything was intact and working properly .I would not buy again.
658,"First things first, the watch came quickly, it is a beautiful color, I was feeling so excited about it, however when I took the watch out of the box I was so sad to find out the face of the watch was completely lifting from the watch itself. Basically the whole screen wasn’t detached but wasn’t even really on. When I bought the watch it stated it was in a excellent condition so feeling pretty disappointed about the quality!"
659,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I really like how shipped fast also really cute and works perfect 🤩"
660,"My daughter was super excited about her watch, but after fully charging, the battery only lasted 2 hours. I checked all the settings to make sure they matched how mine are set on my watch, & she tried wearing it again the next day. The battery only lasted 4 hours. We are returning the watch, & we’re hoping for better luck with another one. Everything else was great except a small scratch on the screen that you couldn’t see after we put a screen protector on.  It did not come in original packaging, but it was packaged well. It came with a large band, which was too big for her wrist but an easy fix to buy a small band at Walmart. Overall, I’m only giving it one star because if the battery doesn’t last more than a couple hours, the watch is useless"
661,They installed the battery magnet backwards so it repels the charger. The fact this got sent out without being checked beats me.  I wouldn’t not trust any product from them given they obviously do not QC there products
662,"Looks good, band can come undone"
663,I have been trying to connect this watch since I received yesterday also the watch did not come with a full charger which should considering the cost so far I’m very disappointed
664,"This watch only lasted me a month. Exactly a month. I took it if it’s charger it was extremely hot and the whole screen was popped out, and it was not turning on. Luckily I had got a cover by asurion but how it broke they wouldn’t even cover it. I wasted my money on this product don’t waste yours. Doesn’t even deserve one star."
665,
666,"Lamentablemente el momento que llego el reloj sabíamos que tendríamos problemas, se notaba que la pantalla había sido abierta y vuelta a colocar porque en un lado el borde de la pantalla sobresalía. Después se descargaba muy rápido  la batería y lo peor dejaba de funcionar el táctil, al punto de no poder ni siquera ingresar el código de desbloqueo. Comenzó a fallar inmediatamente después de recibir el paquete, que por cierto que contenía una pulsera plástica de baja calidad."
667,This was a referbished product. The watch works well but it was shipped with a charger that was defective. Better quality control would prevented this.
668,I like the watch and wear it daily. But it came with the wrong charger and was forced to buy a different one. Spending over $200 I expect the product to work out of the box.
669,"Bought the SE 40mm watch renewed, no flaws, everything looks good.  Upgraded from the series 3 38mm for the faster processor and bigger screen (SE goes edge-to-edge which makes a difference on my older eyes).  Promptly added an LK screen protector/case combo and watch is now battle-ready."
670,"The watch and bands were in great condition, no scratches and looked like new. Unfortunately I couldn’t set it up because it had an iCloud lock. Since there’s no way to know who the previous owner is, there’s really no way to set this up with an activation lock. Ended up returning it. If you order this, chances are you’ll get the watch in a pretty good condition but hopefully yours isn’t locked. I guess I was under the assumption that Amazon Renewed meant it was professionally inspected and tested? If they actually do this to make sure they’re selling a functional product, then you’d figure they would see right away that the watch was locked"
671,It look like new but battery life is bad can’t even last a day
672,"Acaba de llegar el producto, pero no viene incluida la correa deportiva blanca como lo indica el anuncio."
673,I order the 40 mm watch and it arrived two days late and it’s not turning on or even charging.
674,"I love my first Apple Watch. Everything works perfectly, Thank You"
675,
676,My son love it but pricy
677,"I got this watch in the mail in September at the beginning of that month, it never turned on. I let it charge over night and over a work day. I did the process for a refund to be picked up by the UPS delivery person on the next business day, they picked it up I received a receipt saying they picked it up and my status still says waiting to receive item back. It’s been over a month now and I have not received my refund!"
678,"I had been wanting the raved about Apple Watch for a LONG time. I had A FitBit Versa 2 and said when it died I’d break down and spend the $$$ to get an Apple Watch… I was NOT impressed. The workout tracking is subpar, the sleep tracking was difficult to even view (and fitbit gives me averages for the whole week, etc)… if you’re a lady they have the “cycle tracking” but it is not nearly as accurate as FITBiT. I have been an Apple user for a long time (I won’t be giving up my iPhone any time soon) but I was highly disappointed with the Apple Watch. Also, the battery barely lasted a little over a day, I can go 3-4 days without ever charging my Fitbit! I have returned the Apple watch and switched back to a Fitbit Versa 3 (my Versa 2 lasted me 4 + years)."
679,The watch worked fine for 1 week then started malfunctioning. I started the return and FedEx came quickly but I've been waiting 2 weeks and no refund. Help.
680,Save yourself the trouble and buy a new one. This came defective with the screen completely popping off and the refund process took forever.
681,Works perfectly and I paid a fraction of what I would've paid elsewhere.
682,I bought this watch for my active 15 year old daughter and it works great!
683,"La caja manipulada, le cambiaron el embalaje a FedEx y no llegó por el original de Amazon, de paso Llego destrozado el cargador , el tiempo de vida de la batería es inútil , no sirve , no es una condición excelente la que yo elegí comprar , es un completo engaño y estafa , SI NO QUIERE BOTAR SU DINERO NO COMPRE"
684,Only 3 month used it then broken. This seller doesn’t response this item. Only use to 90 days for over $180?
685,I ore the 40mm which I really like easy to read aneits very comfortable
686,Looks brand new. Came in a sealed box. The battery life ran out quite quickly. Less than a day so that’s concerning. And to kick the charger that was included doesn’t work. Or atleast I hope it’s the charger. Will update when I spend $30 on a new one today. Pretty upset about that as I went with this refurbished model to save money.
687,"The watch was in perfect condition, no scratches. Works as new, very pleased with my purchase."
688,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The screen was glued on so bad and the battery was dead.  Cheap but not worth it if it’s a gift for someone special. If you want okay quality buy a more expensive watch 🥹"
689,This watch is of terrible quality with deep scratches on the face and back. It's so scratched the face is hardly visible. The battery doesn't stay charged for more than 4 hrs no in use just on my hand.Avoid this seller.
690,My granddaughter loves this watch!
691,Came poorly packaged as well as looks very used super scratched screen and sides think before you buy.
692,The watch looked almost new. Works well and was able to be programmed.
693,Didn’t work after one week and not fully refunded 😡 168$ re-shelving fee. Felt scammed.
694,Do NOT buy from this seller. Nothing about the product is renewed/ restored. Scratches and dents everywhere in the screen and not in good shape at all. Super slow to respond as well
695,This watch does everything it says it will do. It was just what I was looking for.
696,Watch works really well. This is the second Apple Watch I’ve had and I love them. The downfall that I’m seeing with this watch is that the battery does not last. Last night I went to bed with the battery at 80 percent and I woke up with it dead. It’s supposed to be on my wrist more than the charger but that doesn’t seem to be the case with this one.
697,"This was suppose to be I’m ‘excellent’ condition and has a deep scratch on the face. Also, the band it comes with is for a larger watch size. As you can see from the pictures, the white band sticks out on both sides of the face and doesn’t lock into place. I will have to buy a new band that fits a 40mm."
698,"Ordered the ""excellent"" condition renewed watch and received a watch face with 2 chips in it and a generic, cheap looking band.  Can buy a new one cheaper at Walmart.  Don't waste your time."
699,"When I received this for the “excellent refurbished” Apple Watch, it came with a large crack in the screen and the watch does not turn on when plugged in. I unfortunately got this as a birthday present for a significant other and did not open the box until it was delivered 3 weeks after so it was very disappointing seeing that it does not work and has a massive crack going through."
700,It is a good watch. But it came with a passcode. Had to hard reset it after calling Amazon and Apple. So beware it just might come with a lock code. If it does press and hold the off button until power off comes up then press and hold the crown to reset.!.!
701,I love the fitness tracking
702,"I have had an iwatch 3 for years, have dropped it many many times and it’s never cracked. This one fell off of my night stand when I was charging it and the whole screen shattered within a week of owning it. It’s cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the screen."
703,"When I received this item it has a chip in the top corner face of the device and the twist dial had something white caked into it. It was not in original apple packaging either. I was sadly very disappointed. Idk how it worked, but it did turn on."
704,Watch looks brand new and everything seemed fine until I started using it and....... the battery life is terrible!!!It only lasts about 2 hours while tracking a workout and then it dies. Even when I put it on airplane mode it dies super quick.Terrible battery life. Super frustrated with this purchase.
705,"Todo funciona bien, me ha funcionado de maravilla y es muy práctico toda la descripción es correcta."
706,Refurbished
707,Bubble appeared under the screen after two days. Functioning properly but looks horrible
708,Love it
709,Disappointed! I paid a good amount of refurbish SE Watch and only to received a cheap packaging! The effin watch was inside a ziplock! WTH?????? Plus the back is made out of thick looking white plastic! Ugh! I am so livid!!!!! Up to this day I haven’t gotten my refund/money back!!!!!
710,"There was no watch face in the box- the spot for it was empty. Super disappointing birthday gift for a family member. I sent it back for a refund over 10 days ago and still no refund, it’s been marked “in transit” with no updates. So far I’m down a birthday gift and out $200+."
711,No clue how to charge it. Came faster then expected which was nice but now I have to buy a separate charger.
712,"Like the look and feel. Can’t discuss actual functions since I didn’t know it wouldn’t come with a USB-C power adapter. MOSTLY: I feel as though the main description of the product misled me into thinking it was new.  Upon receipt of the watch, I see and have all documentation that it was refurbished. After reading my order summary, I somehow missed the spot(s) where it said “refurbished,” but I think that’s because they really weren’t clear.  Not happy w/Amazon right now."
713,Watch never worked charged it for 24 and updated software. Never turned on
714,TERRIBLE. SOMEONE STOLE IT AND REPLACED THE SEEL AND SHIPPED BACK. AMAZON NEVER CHECKED THE BOX YET RENEWED IT. WHOEVER ORDERED IT FIRST STOLE IT.
715,Bad quality’s of the wrist band doesn’t the original. They scratch and hurt when you wear it.
716,I was excited to check out this gift I bought my fiancé for Christmas and immediately was concerned when I seen the packaging.It was a renewed product though so I looked past the packaging.To say the least I was extremely disappointed and well not too happy when I opened the boxes to check out this watch.The screen was completely shattered the bands were scratched up and the extra bands that came with only had one band in the box.Not happy at all
717,"Battery only lasted between 10 to 12 hours.  While charging, the watch would get so hot you could barely touch it"
718,"I received the Apple Watch without the original box, wrong sport bands, they don’t look like the pictures, spot where the sport bands go is dirty, screen has more than 6 scratches. So disappointed!"
719,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is honestly laughable. Not even close to excellent conidition for a refurbished product. The watch body came badly scratched and dirty. I understand what buying a refurbished apple product means as a consumer, I’ve bought plenty of them. This would not even pass as “good” condition."
720,"I am sure there are a lot of you wondering what exactly you need a smart watch for when you have a smartphone. I too was one of these people wondering the same thing asking myself if I could justify the price, how often would I use it, is it worth it, and all those questions. Meanwhile, when my sister heard I was considering one, little did I know she already had one and she was able to tell me all the benefits of them and really suggested I get one which settled it for me. So, I made the purchase.Initially, I was not sure about which size to get but historically I get larger size items like the iPhone MAX so I can see the screen, or the larger iPad, etc. So, I decided to get the larger faced watch with GPS only - I didn't see the need to get wifi personally.Once the watch arrived, I opened up the box and went through the puzzle of getting the watch, band and charging wire out of there. I admit, it was a bit complex to go through but I finally got all the components out.Setting it up was easy, paring with phone no problem.I have been using the watch for a few months now. I find myself trying to be more active, monitoring my heart more and monitoring my sleeping which is one of the important reasons I got the watch. The watch itself isn't causing me to sleep better, but I can identify the times I'm awake during the night and make adjustments with my sleep schedule to get more sleep which has worked for me. The watch tells me to stand up and move are around (I work a 9-5 desk job and never took a moment to stretch) as well as to take a moment to breathe and clear my mind - all good features. Not only do I work 9-5 at the desk, afterhours and weekends I'm doing mechanical work, work where you typically have two hands occupied and really greasy and dirty. I was surprised I could call from and receive calls to the watch instead of having to drop everything, clean up, find my phone and take important calls.The strap/band the watch comes with is alright, but I made the mistake of putting them on the watch the wrong way which, if you do the same thing, it is very easy for the strap to come unbuttoned and the watch will come off. Once this was pointed out to me and corrected, it is much more secure and easy to clean (again, grease/grime/dirt from mechanical work). I would suggest you have different bands for different activities you do as the original band sometimes makes my wrist tired after a long day of wear.I opted not to get any sort of protective case or screen for the watch but your preferences may differ. I also choose not to wear it in water even though it is water resistant.BATTERY: It will last me a day before I need to charge. Do not expect it to last days on end. However, it does charge pretty fast so you can put it on the charger when you find time for a break during the day. I choose to charge it either at night before bed when I'm getting things ready for the next day, and then I'll put it on before sleep. Or, I'll take it off in the morning when I wake up and charge it while I'm getting myself ready for the day.As far as recommendation - yes, I would recommend it. It has the capability of your phone without having to actually carry the phone everywhere you go around the house but I find it having more health related benefits that the phone simply can't offer you."
721,"Pros:-Siri is amazing on this. I just lift my watch and tell Siri to do something. Setting timers for food cooking has never been so easy. Alarms, reminders, etc.- The color and graphics are fantastic- Fitness tracking is what I always wanted. Sometimes I have workouts where I know there’s points in the middle where I’m slacking. The watch will be able to tell if it was active calories burnt vs regular.- Tracking everything with the app is really nice. I can easily access my workouts- Calls come in pretty clear though I don’t use this feature often-Charges so fastCons:- The Sleep app is TERRIBLE. I downloaded a better one than the default and it’s still kind of annoying that I have to pick my bedtime hours to track and if I sleep outside of those hours it doesn’t teach.- Ignoring groups can be tricky. I keep trying to ignore a group and 3 days later, the notifications will be on again- Battery life isn’t the BEST, but still decentOverall, I love this watch. It can charge in like an hour so I’m pretty good at keeping it charged. The only thing I wish is if they could fix the sleep tracking. I really wanted accurate data for that."
722,"Love all of the features series 8 offers compared to series 3 that I've written for several years! More of my phone apps work on this watch, such as my geenie app so I can turn on and off lights from my watch.  I love the heath features, I have AFib and I'm getting old so it's important to me to keep an eye on my heart rate and blood oxygen even if I'm not at home. ECG could help me know if I need to go to the ER too.  Yes, I know my rate in my pic is high but I'm ok, I was just up and active, it's back down now. This is the 41mm, I considered the big one but as you can see my wrists are tiny and the 45mm would have been too big for me. This one has a much bigger and edge to edge screen than my series 3, much easier for aging eyes to read. I'm very happy with my purchase!! And it was a great price too!"
723,"I was nervous getting this as gift. She is not very technical and hated migrated to an iPhone. However, this was an accessory that she used every day and she is liking very much. If you getting this specifically for a woman for the heat tracking; she doesn’t seem to use it as much and still manually inputs everything on a separate app. So save the money and if you see a series 7 for a good price snag that instead."
724,I love the gorgeous red of this watch. The watch was packaged nicely. The instructions were easy to follow. This watch is so much more advanced than my Fitbit. I love all the numerous features and learn something new and cool every day about it!  I was surprised by the battery life but it makes sense since I have it set to flash on at every movement but it charges incredibly fast! I was shocked when I realized my iPhone charger block wouldn’t have the same connections for me to charge my watch. I was able to find an adapter on Amazon pretty easily.
725,"While I purchased my wife an iWatch 8 last year, I stuck with a traditional watch. However, I needed to monitor my heart rate while exercising and the exercise bike was not accurate. I have to admit the iWatch has been useful keeping me on task for exercise. Happy with my purchase."
726,"I like the product. the box was damaged when received, the wrist band was a little bent but I have not had any issues. It does have to be charged every night, that is the biggest issue I have had."
727,"Its an Apple! What more needs to be said! Great Watch, fits well and does everything (and more)! Great for tracking activity! I use it for Water Volleyball too!!!"
728,This is a good watch but the charger it came with didn’t work and I had to purchase a new one.
729,"This is my third Apple watch.  I don't know how I ever did without one and with each replication, there are more features.  If you don't have one, get it - you will love it!"
730,I really like the fit and function so far. however the band size runs a little small.Typing is a little awkward but you get use to it.
731,"This is the first smart watch I’ve ever owned, or even seen. I am very happy with it or use it often to track my hiking distance. The only thing I wish is I could have Google Earth on it I would like to have a satellite view of where I am hiking not just a map. It comes with a USB-C charger and I wanted to get a USB a charger as well and the cheapest ones from Amazon did not charge this watch at all. I will spend a few more dollars and get a name brand one.  Over alli am very happy with this watch. Buy the clip on protective cover if you wear it daily doing physical work to protect it from scratches on the face"
732,Super fast delivery and it came in excelent condition.
733,My SE watch only lasts about 10-12 hours. Sometimes it would die before I came home from work. This watch lasts all day and night. It charges much quicker as well.
734,"This is my second Apple Watch. Obviously I like them or I wouldn't go for round two. My big disappointment when ordering was about band size. I need a larger one, but there was confusion around the order and I ended up with a smaller one. While I could return the whole AW order, I didn't really want to do that. Now I'm using a new watch with an old band because I can't just swap bands and buying one identical to the one I have is a ridiculous price. So I'm stuck. I bought an aftermarket band, but it isn't what I truly want. To all of you ordering, be extra diligent when picking sizes. Yes, I should have returned it, but I didn't."
735,If you have an iPhone I highly recommend it.
736,It an amazing watch ! He loves it!
737,"Battery life is ok for me, I get a little over a day. Love the smart watch health features and 3rd party apps. Stryd works great for running, apple run power also fantastic, etc. little more work exporting data to everywhere you may want vs garmin, but not too big of a deal with healthfit or run gap."
738,"It’s really just a fancy watch, but i like it, i wear it, i talk dirty to it, recommended"
739,"I love my Apple Watch 8!I hadn’t worn a watch in years; pretty much not since I’d gotten a smartphone. But now I find it a great tool. I use it to find my phone about 3 times per day (saves about 3 min each time). I record my meds, set alarms, track sleep modes, get more active. It’s really a great device."
740,Just get one lol.  I broke my old one and was without for a while. Missed having the notifications and tracking features so grabbed this one on a deal around Xmas time.  Love it
741,"I got this as a safety security. I live alone and have no desire for one of those neck alarms. This is wonderful!  I slammed the chest freezer door shut and it immediately contacted me, asking if I had fallen. I had to reply 3 times, assuming my welfare. This is fabulous. I know it’s pricey, but worth it!"
742,"My older Apple Watch was no longer supported with my new phone, I had it for 5 years and it was still working. So I upgraded to this one and it was a great buy! Love the new features and expect it to last several years like my other one."
743,It seems that the charger cable doesn’t work with other charging squares
744,It is my husband fav now
745,Had 1 day . Bought more for health tracking . No blood pressure measuring or monitoring
746,"I had a series 2 Apple Watch and its battery was not holding a charge anymore.  The model 2 watch is no longer software upgradeable and the cost to change the battery in it did not seem to be the smart move with all that has changed in the watch.  I love the new brighter display and the ""constant on"" feature of the display.  The battery is still at 50% at the end of the day when I place it on the charging puck, so the battery life is great in spite of the constant on display.  I still use pretty much the same apps as I did before so the upgrade was not for the apps but for the battery and display.  Now if Apple only included real time glucose monitoring for diabetics, that would be nirvana and the rating would likely be 5 stars."
747,Good
748,"I like the apple watch.  That said, it had a breakdown on me only a month after I got it.  I reset it, and it's not had another issue, yet.  But, that's only been a couple of weeks ago, so we'll see.  I like that you pick your face, and what it shows.  Your steps, sleep, ekg, etc.  I was hospitalized shortly after i got it, and it kept telling me my heart rate was high.  Accurate. I keep finding more things it does.  I like it all around, just hope it doesn't breakdown on me again."
749,This is the first apple watch I ever purchased and it’s an invaluable tool for someone with an active lifestyle. I love tracking my calories and stats through the day and after my workouts!  I have no complaints so far!
750,Battery life
751,Love it!!
752,Great improvements over 1st generation
753,Health apps
754,"It was bought for a friend, and he liked it very much"
755,Very nice for its intended purpose as a fitness tracker.
756,"UPGRADES from Series 7:S8 Chip:  This is basically the same as the S7 chip, with a few new integrated sensors:--Temperature Sensors:  Measures wrist temp. only while sleeping, takes five days to build baseline.  Currently only used to help retroactively analyze ovulation cycles after two cycles.  Not predictive.--High G accelerometer and improved gyroscope:  Able to detect car crashes and call for help.  (Same feature available in iPhone 14)-Different Color options: (Currently no blue or green?)That’s it.  Everything else is exactly the same as the Series 7.  The only way I can even tell them apart is by the color, otherwise they look the same.  The only benefits to upgrading to a Series 8 from a Series 7 would be the improved ovulation tracking features via nighttime wrist temperature, (though Apple warns that this is not necessarily predictive and should only be used to retroactively analyze your cycles after a couple months of use, and you would have to be wearing it at night often because this feature only uses sleep temp data), or the car-crash detection (but if you are going to get an iPhone 14, then this feature will be in your phone already).  So, if you are not interested in the ovulation data (or just don’t want to wear the watch every night- because maybe you charge it at night), and you plan to get an iPhone 14, then there is no reason to upgrade to this Series 8 at all.  The series 8 does come with Watch OS 9 which has some new software features, but all Apple Watches Series 4 or later can upgrade to this same OS 9.  (So that is Series 4, 5, 6, and 7, and SE, all support upgrading to Watch OS 9)So basically, it is hard to recommend getting this Watch Series 8.  If you can live without the wrist temp ovulation analysis and car crash detection in the watch, then I would suggest sticking with Series 7.  Even Series 6 isn’t that different in terms of performance, it and will still support Watch OS 9.  If you are buying your first Apple Watch, I would still suggest getting the less expensive Series 7.  Or you could also look into the new SE 2, which is about $150 less expensive than this Series 8, but lacks several other features like the Always-On-Display, ECG, blood oxygen and IP6X rating."
757,Best product ever!
758,"I have been waiting to get a refund, returned watch would not sink with my phone! 2 weeks no refund!!!! Beware? Now it’s been 32 days still no refund 😡"
759,"I mainly bought this watch to support my fitness activities and it does a great job of that.  The number of available functions is somewhat overwhelming, but it's easy to find the ones that are most useful to me on a day-to-day basis.  I look forward to learning how to use other functions."
760,"I’m happy with this Apple Watch- it came brand new even though it didn’t have the original plastic wrapping on their outside box, it still had the sealed tapes. It was easy to set up and also an easy learning curve for use. The screen is perfect! My only complaint is with Apple for not proving a USB-C plug for the USB-C cord. I’m reluctantly using my iBook plug to charge the watch until i can get a new plug. This should be explained in the numerous description information and the photos. Yeah, it shows the cord- who would think it didn’t come with the plug?I’m thrilled also that Apple partnered up with Product Red so  that i could support a cause that I have a huge respect for- that of preventing HIV and AIDS. I had a family member die of AIDS and if the research and prevention happening now had happened in the early 90s then she might not have died from a tainted blood transfusion and could’ve afforded the medication protocol. So for me- this watch is not only my favorite color, but also a purchase to support a cause I feel strongly about. Product Red also helps solve Poverty, and Health Care throughout the world."
761,"I purchased the new Apple Watch 8 for my wife as an anniversary gift. She loves anything and everything apple, and I myself prefer other options.As for a review, I am comparing the Apple Watch 8 to my Garmin Venu 2.Many of the added and new features of Apple's newest watch, like SOS and biometrics monitoring, have been a staple in their competitors' products for a while now.Comparing the responsiveness of the Series 8 to the Venu 2 is quite a big leap, as the Series 8 has a faster chip and can perform many tasks, including video animations like Toy Story characters running around the screen with phenomenal clarity and resolution, which is one thing it does that my Garmin does not.Comparing the reliability, however, does show how Apple is lacking in the functionality of its watch. To start, the GPS signal in the Garmin is better than the Series 8 when out in the wilderness or anywhere where the signal may not be as great, whereas the Series 8 seems to lack a proper signal. As well as my Garmin has more accurate biometrics reading when comparing our vitals being monitored with a pulse oximetry device.Overall the build quality seems comparable to my Garmin, as both have been plunged into deep enough water, both in the ocean and in 10'  swimming pools. Neither has shown any water damage since. For impact damage, the Apple watch seems to be more resilient as my Venu 2 has a few dings here and there for it hitting desks, and normal wear and tear, yet the Apple Watch still looks as good as it did out of the box.Overall, the Apple Watch 8 is a great product for someone who likes to stay in the Apple ecosystem."
762,"I'm not sure if it's just me, but the battery life sucks. It lasts about a day a half, and that's with turning off at night. You really can't use it during the day and expect to use the sleep tracking and health tracking features at night because it would need to be charged the next day. My series 3 had a much better battery life."
763,I bought my husband this watch for his birthday. He absolutely loves it!!!! Excellent purchase!
764,"I love my watch. Very accurate tracking and everything is easily accessible. I wish the health, fitness, and watch apps were better integrated so that you didn’t have to switch between the three of them to see all of your data in detail, but it’s not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. My only issue is that Siri sometimes thinks I am talking to my watch and writes/sends text messages without me meaning to. I need to play with the settings more to see if that is fixable."
765,"My 89 year old grandpa loves it.He always would complain about my mom’s solution to her concern for his safety, as he is a hard-of-hearing, aging but independent, recent widower — Life Alert. It was bulky, uncomfortable, frankly outdated, and $60/month!This smart watch not only saves him money, but also helps him know someone is calling with a gentle buzz of the wrist, tracks his sleep, heart rate, AND oxygen levels, AND provides him a daily momento as we setup his watch face to be a picture of him and my grandma.Could not recommend enough for your independent single grandparents!"
766,It’s a legit Apple Watch and it’s a beautiful red. Just like any other Apple Watch and works well and in perfect condition.
767,I love it Red is hot!!!
768,i bought this for my daughter she loves it. charge lasts for over 12 hours.
769,Me gusto funciona muy bien y sin problema
770,Easy to use. Very sleek and nice design.
771,"my experience with apple products is that they work.  they work well, they work together.  I'm happy with this watch. wanted features to help me with my fitness, sleep, etc.  Battery charges in 15 minutes. it syncs with my phone and laptop.  it's great."
772,"I thought the original Apple Watches were great, and then felt like they were just fine tuning previous versions and calling it something new for each series. This is light years ahead of where we were with the series 7. The display is easier to read, the voice to text feature makes less errors than my phone, and the sleep tracking is spot on; so good that I know how long it takes me to get out of bed in the middle of the night to concede to the obvious fact that I need to pee!This is great!"
773,"I recently purchased the Apple Watch Series 8 and I have to say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. The watch is sleek and stylish, with a beautiful display that makes it a pleasure to wear. The fitness tracking features are also top-notch, accurately tracking my workouts and providing valuable insights into my activity levels.I also appreciate the convenience of being able to receive notifications and make payments directly from my wrist. The watch is also water-resistant, making it the perfect companion for my swim workouts.Overall, I would highly recommend the Apple Watch Series 8 to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile smartwatch that can keep up with their active lifestyle. It has quickly become an indispensable part of my daily routine."
774,"Purchased for a family member who is older and would like to track her heart rate, detect falls, call for help etc. It doesn’t come with a charging block. Wish we knew that when we got the watch. She’s using an iPhone 13 but when she purchased her phone, it came with the old 5W USB-A charging block and this watch’s charger is only compatible with USB-C. So far she can’t charge her watch to see if it works (died after trying to set-up). Guess she’ll have to order a charging block for an additional $20."
775,"As a fan of the Apple Eco-system (iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch) I upgraded to Series 8 for the features that involve your health. The heart and fitness information is exactly what I was looking for. The battery is long lasting (up to two days) so I can wear it all night (when it once detected Afib) and charge it for an hour or so in the morning. Everything you like about Apple Watch is here, and more."
776,"Love the watch, it does everything I need it to do and more. Sleep tracking is excellent, heart rate monitor and blood oxygen sensor are very useful. The alarm hasn’t failed me yet.The downside? Having all of those features constantly monitoring for changes drains the battery quicker than I’d like. Note that I dimmed the brightness of the display and turned off the “always on” feature. It helped a bit but to get the most out of the battery, you’ll have to turn off the active monitoring features.Low power mode is always an option if you’re really needing to conserve battery but it turns off 99 percent of features to do this.I have a charger nearby 95 percent of the time so that minimizes the issue somewhat.I‘d give it a half star back if that was an option (so realistically a 4.5 out of 5)Some people will say get the Ultra if you need a better battery, but I couldn’t justify $800."
777,"Slick profile, top notch performance, effortless pairing with iPhone 14 Pro."
778,"This is my third watch, 1,2,8, battery could be better, charged every day. So far they all work as advertised.."
779,I like the larger face as compared to my first generation watch. Medical features are also at the top of my list.
780,"The watch is what it is, but this review is to warn you if you need this soon then go to the Apple Store. It took 11 days to get to me and we have Prime"
781,"I want a little money I paid off a few bills. We had a little leftover and she’s like oh good I can get a new watch. She likes it if mom is happy, I’m happy because what they say is. If mama ain’t happy, ain’t nobody going to be she loves it."
782,"The device is very convenient to keep track of your daily fitness. The bluetooth function makes it a lifesaver during wintertime as u don’t have to keep taking your phone out of your pockets to make/ take a call.The series 7 came with an extra wristband, this only comes with 1 pair"
783,"Great for fitness tracking, Encourages you to excerise daily,  Also the fact that you do not need your iphone on you  all the time , when reeiving a call. I purchased watch with a $60 discount from Amex, which results in a great buy.  Love that you can track your heart rate when excerising. and see the improvements in your heart rate .VENDOR SHOULD STATE IN DESCRIPTION , THAT YOU REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF A IPNONE 8 TO PAIR THE WATCH. IN REVIEWS SOME CUSTOMER PURCHASED THIS WATCH WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THIS FACT."
784,"Great size, and great Apple item, but battery life too short."
785,VERY disappointed this didn’t come with a charging cube. Would’ve been nice if it would’ve been mentioned somewhere or grouped as being sold together had no idea. Now I have to wait two days for one to be shipped.
786,Item as Described. Thank you. Exactly what I needed.
787,"Love my Apple Watch.  There are so many features to figure out.  I like that Mini Mouse will tell me the time.  Use Low Power Mode to extend battery life.  Mostly got it for the sleep, steps, health features and especially for asking, then calling someone if I fall down."
788,"I did not think that I needed such an expensive but my husband surprised me with this one and I love it.  Besides all the tracking functions and having a beautiful face that is always easy to read, the best thing is to be able to answer calls and texts without having to run and fine my phone.  I am finding that I am missing less calls and responding to texts quicker.  Yes with all the functions it needs charging more often that it says but it is no shorter than the cheaper versions.  I just keep my charger by my bed so it can charge at night since I really don't need the sleep tracker.  My best advice is don't mess around with the cheaper versions. Go for the gold it is worth it!"
789,"The Apple Watch series 8 is an all around great smart watch, especially if you are involved in the Apple ecosystem. It has solid battery life, easily making it through a full day off one charge. The apps available are quite convenient and make you feel much less of a need to pull out your phone constantly throughout the day. I initially did not think much of the car crash safety feature, but I've got to admit there is something comforting about knowing your watch can act as a life alert help signal in the event of a car crash. Hopefully I never need to rely on that feature but it is comforting to know it is there. The health features like the blood oxygen monitor are also quite useful, and supposedly the monitor as reliable as a medical-grade device according to a recent study in the Digital Health open access journal.Overall I am quite pleased with this smart watch and think it was a fantastic purchase."
790,This was a gift for my son.  He loves the watch.  It's comfortable.  He love being able to set his watch face and track his health and fitness with the apps.  It's perfect.
791,Made for a great gift.
792,"This watch helps me keep my life together. Cliche? Maybe. But, I love that it keeps track of my burned calories, my standing time, and my exercise. I have noticed that the series 8 tends to be more accurate with my workouts as well.Apple Watch also is compatible with Peloton."
793,"Love the Apple Watch, I used the series 3 for many years and this was a great upgrade. Battery life and processor speed are great, I love that it keeps track of my laps in the pool and all my workouts."
794,The media could not be loaded.
795,"I bought this as a birthday present to myself. Bought it to replace a Fitbit Versa2. Took a few weeks to get used to, but love it! Missed my reminder to take 250 steps each hour, but eventually figured out the activity rings. Like the always on display. Just wish the battery life was a bit longer. I'm trying to remember to charge it each night while I watch TV."
796,"This is the best Apple watch I have encountered. The design is nice and sleek and feels good when you wear it (I hate wearing watches traditionally but this one I don't mind this one at all). It has a ton of features and customizations and if you download the Facer app from the app store (it's free) you can do even more customizations to the watch face to get exactly what you want. The O2 monitor, heart rate, and ECG monitors are also nice features with this model so if you are concerned with those issues, this watch is for you. I was traditionally an Android user but after all the innovations that Apple has made recently, they have me converted."
797,"Es mi primer Apple Watch comprado en Amazon y llego en un excelente estado, con caja y accesorios originales, en un tiempo menor al previsto"
798,"It came with its own box and everything, cords and band . never used."
799,Did not keep this.
800,"Got 2 of these on sales as gift.  Not the best looking Apple Watch out there, for example I got the stainless steel one with leather band, but that one alone cost 2 of these. So if you really want Apple Watch for usage utility, get these on sales!"
801,"I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven't had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch's ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn't really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night."
802,I like the watch so far but it did not come wIth an adapter so I am now waiting for one. It needed to be charged in a few hours...greed is terrible thing.It was relatively to set up using my iphone.I will edit this review after I get the adapter.Sigh.
803,"Easy to set up. Love the new features the Apple Watch Series 8 has. Shipped fast. Didn’t realize that Midnight color has a blue color to it, thought it was black."
804,"Hermoso y practico, me fascina"
805,"I think I’m most disappointed with the lack of new colors, is anything I believe they’ve taken the more unique green and blue out of the lineup completely.  I think the crash detection is interesting and I use it for health tracking, but not really much of an update.  I only bought it because I always seem to…"
806,Merry Christmas gift happy people good life good time
807,This apple watch is excellent for health tracking like heart rate oxygen level and ECG. Sleep tracking really impress me a lot. Battery life is also impressive. One thing that I am really don’t like is apps. There is not much app available and even some available apps don’t work properly
808,I'm pleased with the watch but still have lots to learn how to best use it
809,"Bought the Apple Watch 8 used because I don’t have the money or intention of buying something almost as expensive as the phone . The condition was “ Like New “ and that “ nothing wrong with box “ or something like that . I went for this one and when it arrived it was totally factory sealed , it was probably a return but since it’s a return it can’t be listed as new . I’m so happy because I cant pay the price of a new one but ended up getting one new at the end . God bless Amazon Warehouse deals !!"
810,"I finally gave up on my Fitbit. Too many little things. I resisted the Apple Watch for many years due to the short battery life. I use my watch for both health and sleep tracking, so wanted a once-a-day charge schedule.This watch delivers!  Because there is no Cell Radio, after 24 hrs I still have 40% battery left!  This is useable and I’m very pleased."
811,Awesome I love it
812,So happy that I bought this watch. The battery life is better than the previous generation but could be better.
813,Me encanto este reloj lo ordene para mi esposo es genial muy buen tamaño y ya sabemos la calidad son buenas lo recomiendo a mi esposo le facina 🤩
814,Finally gave in to Apple for watches and I can’t complain. Yes they are more expensive but the quality is amazing. I had to Fitbits that each died after two years which was very disappointing for the price tag. Decided it was time to go Big! Roughly 2 months in and I’m still learning new features.
815,My wife is so happy with the watch.
816,"Looks, functionality, connectivity with phone and other accessories is great! Wish the battery life was a bit efficient."
817,I had an Apple Watch 3 so this was a great upgrade. It has an abundance of Watch faces and can be customized. There are so many things it does that I am constantly finding new uses. Especially as it relates to health. The only drawback as always is the battery life. It does last longer than my Apple Watch 3 by several hours. So far I am very impressed. It is not cheap but you get what you pay for with all the features it contains.
818,"We upgraded from the original Apple Watch to this Apple Watch 8. What a great upgrade and a great Apple Watch. Beautiful vibrant screen, very fast, very reactive and versatile. I highly recommend this smart watch!"
819,"This watch has some great health features. If you have been diagnosed with A-fib this is a must have. You can set HR notifications, it tracks blood O2 levels and tracks activities. Oh and it keeps accurate time as well. Great watch!!"
820,"Es mi primer apple watch y cumplió mis expectactivas, sin embargo tener en cuenta que la batería dura “poco”, pero no es porque sea mala, es por los propios sensores que si están activados consumirán la batería más rápido. A mi me dura 1 día y medio y carga en 1h"
821,My best investment 🤗
822,i got this as a christmas present for my mom. she loves it so much!! it came really quick. the apple box wasn’t damaged in any way. she only had it for a couple days but her sleep tracking is very accurate & the battery life has lasted her a long while. i highly recommend!
823,Need to charge everyday
824,"Tenía mis dudas sobre la autenticidad del producto, 100% original al ser el vendedor Amazon."
825,"Apple makes a great product but their greed never fails to surprise me.  Instead of providing a power cord (magnet) with a standard USB connector, you will need to acquire a USB-C power block.  To be fair, it may not be just greed but why?"
826,"Being a first time Apple Watch buyer I was not aware of the differences between a smart watch, and a fitness watch. Basically, the Apple Watch is a clone of your Iphone. Since I need Fitness help, with the Apple watch I had to add additional apps to track different areas, for example heart monitoring. Also another app for my walking steps to show on the face screen, then Apple fitness is also additional and not free. It all seems messy and all over the place not to have everything under the one watch. It’s a matter of preference. If you don’t care for your watch to also act as your cell phone and your priority is fitness, then be happy and spend much less money in another watch."
827,"Recomiendo que compren el serie 7 a un precio mucho menor, es lo mismo! El serie 8 ha sido una estafa para volver a vender como todos los años! Si realmente quieres dar un salto, tendría que ser al ultra, pero recordando que también es ultra caro"
828,Nice watch and worth the money with great battery life. Except when click an album and choose a song it will not play on my phone and it lowers the volume
829,Who purchased this full price. A shows of discounts since launch. My wife doesn't notice much of a difference from her Series 4 (unlike her upgrade from an Intel to a M2 MBA)
830,"Definitely worth the wait. Apple got it right with this version. I cannot think of another function I would need in a smart watch. With the Apple Watch 8 my phone can stay in my pocket and I can still make calls, get map directions, exercise, check my daily schedule, and so much more."
831,"The battery life is 18 hours which I understand is good for all of the features, but I wish it could be longer.  I guess I want it all.  For the price, it’s everything as advertised.  I love the looks and features, which I’m still learning to use."
832,I love this watch! Best present ever! It’s even easier to work than the iPhone.
833,My husband surprised me with this watch for my anniversary gift! I love it! Was not a watch person prior but quickly got used to wearing it and not I love it!!
834,I like the Apple watch.  I am getting used to wearing it. .The weight and the band takes some getting used to.
835,Just bought it. I don’t have large wrists and this thing can barely fit me. What is this? A wrist band for kids?
836,Have not used for sleeping and still too new to rate battery life. It does record ekg readings and much much more.. make sure to watch utube videos on all the cool things this tracker can do.
837,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I broke the “series 3” and bought the “series 8”…the battery life is great..I have no complaints about this watch..also buy a case"
838,"I upgraded from an Apple watch 4. Wow, the battery life is so much longer. That alone made this purchase worthwhile. Crash detection and always-on are nice extras.  I bought the watch and skipped the iPhone 14. This wears comfortably on my wrist. I have not had any issues yet. Love this watch, my favorite Apple product."
839,I bought this to keep an eye on my heart and this watch came highly recommended. But the whole purpose of getting it- to be able to email my Dr the ECG is not reliable. It glitches often and reads inconclusive a lot more than clear readings. Sad.
840,Good
841,Great watch with so many features.
842,"this Apple Watch is not compatible wit I phone 7, not pairable ."
843,Love my watch it does everything I need it to do. I love that it can check my blood oxygen when I need to with out having to carry around my little checker
844,This is a good upgrade if you are coming from Series 4 or 5.Apart from that there’s nothing much to distinguish from the Series 7 or Series 6 apart from a better battery and slightly noticeable display size increase.Got this as a gift to someone who have never had an Apple Watch so it was worth for them.
845,Nice still exploring
846,"Bought this for my wife's birthday and she absolutely loves it. Everyday she tells me about different features it has and how fantastic it is. Battery life seems to be real good, as she only seems to charge it every other day or so. It's really a premium device and worth every penny"
847,Acorde a Apple
848,Exactly what I wanted
849,The fitness tracking is great and you can share with other fitness tracker to stay motivated
850,Just want I need it to keep my fitness goals!
851,The box arrived without seal and dirty. I returned without opening it. Waiting for my refund
852,"I purchased this to monitor my heart and such (getting old is interesting lol)With all the monitoring, I can upload to a PDF and send to my Dr for evaluation..Watch is nice and easy to use and is authentic"
853,"Great gift for loved one! The EKG feature works amazing, and the way this watch is able to track your sleep patterns makes you skip out on other tracking devices.Great for the price, fast delivery."
854,"Had my watch for about a week now and I love it! I will say though, it didn’t come wrapped in plastic wrap like they usually are so that made me skeptical that maybe I received a used or fake.. but turns out my sister in law who ordered hers right from apple came the same way!! I guess they are getting rid of plastic use? All box’s were sealed with a security strip, it just made me nervous because I’ve never seen an Apple Watch not sealed in plastic. I got the starlight color and I love it!"
855,Muy rápido el trámite. Se recibe perfecto
856,"The watch looks amazing on the hand. Purchased it after watching several YouTubers, and it doesn't disappoint. Easily lasts 3-4 Days with normal usage."
857,My wife and I both upgraded from Apple Watch Series 3 to these and we both love them. Tracks all my daily activities and works perfectly with my peloton.
858,"The software on the apple watch 8 I received needed to be updated in order to pair with my iphone 13 pro, but I couldn't pair it because the software isn't updated.  My techie husband and I spent hours going in circles trying to pair it, but it just went in circles back to the starting point.  We tried unpairing my old watch, updating iphone software, turning off/on, etc. Eventually, we figured out that my iphone software could be updated again to 16.0.3.  After updating the phone, the watch pairing and software updating worked.Apple support was not helpful.  I tried to make an appointment with the genius bar nearby but I was directed to a chat or call.  I called a support person and he didn't have any tips.  I also tried a chat with Apple support.  The first rep (or bot) ended the chat with a customer support survey link and then a second rep or bot asked how he could help.  If either rep would have instructed me to confirm my phone was at least version 16, it would have saved me hours of time."
859,"I really like the vibrant red, watch does what you expect it to do, its an Apple."
860,I absolutely love the Apple Watch. Easy setup!  Only downfall is that I do not have the usb c charger for the wall.  They sent the wire but no wall plug in.  It died right after I set it up.
861,"I gave away my Series-7 to a family member and got the Series-8.  It really is a very minor update over the Series-7.  While the Series-8 includes a new “temperature” sensor, the Series-7 comes with lots of color options that matches your style and taste.  In all honesty, the “temperature” feature is not even what you expect it to be, I thought it could track my actual temperature and it would tell me if I’m getting a fever or something.  It doesn’t do that, it was meant to track “ovulation.”  As a male, it is pointless, I would rather have the color options.  Additionally, in terms of accuracy, sleep tracking, and battery life, it is just ok.  It is no better than the Series-7 in terms of battery life, the accuracy of readings and sleep tracking is ok at best.  I love apple products but it really isn’t as accurate as I would like it to be.  Just keep your expectations reasonably low and you won’t be disappointed."
862,He loves his new watch and the features as well as the color red. He said that was his best present for Xmas 💖
863,Apple is apple
864,Watchfeatures
865,good
866,This watch has a terrible battery life specially for the price of it.
867,I had an apple watch 3 series before and this one is so much better. i wear it every day!
868,"A very versatile apple product. Easy to use, easy to wear, & endlessly customizable (even down to the wristbands being interchangeable). Sleep tracker works rather well. Comes with charger cable but no brick sadly."
869,"Como siempre con los productos de Apple, muy complacido con la calidad y la elegancia de sus productos. Ligero , elegante, versátil. Lo uso a diario y hasta la fecha estoy muy complacido y feliz con mi compra."
870,This is the best Apple Watch I have ever had
871,If you don't have a iwatch you should buy one..
872,"I bought this watch to replace a 3 year old series 5 that went into a “reboot lock “, as was diagnosed by the Apple websiteThe new watch took ages to pair to my iPhone, when done it was totally confusing to use. It would constantly ask for my password, even when I wearing it.Trying to eliminate unwanted apps provided to be impossible, even with assistance from the Apple team.I returned the watch to Amazon where I had bought it.It was dropped off at UPS store Dec 2 , 7 days ago, so far no sign of my refundIt took until Jan 7 th 2023 for the refund to be credited to my account"
873,Battery life not meet my expectation
874,Two major complaints that made the person stop using it after they were gifted it:1. Why can I not start using the watch on it own without pairing to a phone/account?2. (Deal Breaker) = The wrist band it came with is terrible for a medical professional working in fast paced hospital settings. Watch fell off twice before they deiced to stop wearing it altogether.
875,Best apple watch yet
876,Everything
877,"I’m replacing a series 3, 38” so the new larger face is great as well as the new features. Can’t wait to try them all out."
878,"If you own other Apple devices, it’s one of the best smart watches out there, although a bit more expensive than the competition."
879,My wife loves this red Apple watch series 8 it's her favorite color! It's a nice big screen with cool new features. The apple watch hardly goes on sale this soon after release so I took advantage of Early Prime day for $50 off. If you are thinking about buying a new Apple watch I would before the sale is over.
880,I bought the Apple Watch Series 8 GPS as an upgrade to an Apple Watch Series 4.  I like the upgrades that come with the 8.  I really like being able to access workouts from the face of the watch.
881,"Loved my first Fitbit, the second not so much. Since I have an Apple phone and iPad, I thought an Apple Watch made sense. I’m underwhelmed by the Apple 8. It is not as intuitive as I’ve come to expect from Apple products. I’ve had to dedicate considerable time searching out information, learning about the features I’m most interested in and correcting changes I have no idea how they came about. I think it’s too complicated for me and I’m not getting the information I want from it. It needs to be recharged daily. 👎🏼"
882,
883,Se lo obsequié a mi pareja. Ella quedó fascinada!
884,"Fast next day delivery, best price at black Friday.Yeah, what should I tell you... If you're an Apple Fan you love it."
885,"Like the ECG, blood oxygen and fall detection features. Only drawback is it has to be charged everyday"
886,"Pretty good, not much improvements over the old models except for the oxygen reading. I like the always on feature, overall feels pretty good, make sure you get a screen protector, otherwise if you drop it on the screen, it will shatter. That is how I broke my old series 5 Watch."
887,This makes either my third or fourth Apple Watch and they keep getting better.I purchased it through Amazon as it was easier and quicker than buying it from Apple.I got the red as I love bright colors along with the red band. It’s great and it puts a smile on my face.
888,the watch is comfortable and works well. delivery was also fast. I recommend it to everyone
889,Thanks Amazon. I got a very low price. Delivery is very fast. Nice product.
890,"Excellent gift, so many options!"
891,I got this for my teen daughter for her birthday.  She prefers and uses iPhone and iPad so this was right up her alley.  This watch seemed pretty easy to set up and use and has some nice features.  My daughter loves it!
892,"Compared to my previous Series 1, this current Series 8 comes with a lot more great features.  It includes EKG, wrist temp, and blood oxygen measurements."
893,Battery life seems a bit short
894,Love it! Looks great works wonderfully
895,Durable works well great sleep tracking very good product
896,"Entregado en su caja original, nuevo de paquete, recibido tal y como fue pedido. importado a Ecuador sin ningun problema"
897,Apple never disappoints.  Very intuitive
898,"Its made by Apple & fills a hole in my tech gap I had not been aware of.  Tales a bit of getting used to, especially syncing to my iPhone, but I see light at the end of the learning curve! Thank you Amazon!"
899,great if you have other apple products
900,Every single thing
901,Perfect!
902,"I love this watch, has wonderful features and easy to use"
903,Amazing what it does.  Kind of a big face.  I put bling on it with a new band and face shield
904,This one charges a lot faster than previous one I owned
905,LOVE APPLE PRODUCT.
906,It doesn't track sleep unless you setup (and then optionally ignore) the Sleep app.  I didn't figure that until I'd already decided to return it.  Pretty lackluster UX.
907,I loved my 6 and this one is just a touch better
908,Estoy sorprendido con la duracion de la bateria. 100% recomendado
909,Perfect.
910,Make sure you have the IPhone 12 and correct version of iOS.Besides that it is a nice watch. Band a little tight.
911,Calidad apple !
912,"Love the sleep feature, love the exercise tracker, lots of other things too!"
913,Love all features.
914,"My wife loves everything about it, the only negative thing is you have to charge the battery every 18 to 20 hours"
915,
916,"I’ve been using a series 0 since 2015 and it was definitely time to upgrade, I decided to get the series 8 and what a great watch! Apple has improved a lot all over these years, I’m very happy."
917,8 series is waste of money . Hardly any difference between 7 and 8. If you want to buy plz buy 7 series only … 8 is complete waste
918,"It's really a nice thing, but the battery needs constant charging, which is the only drawback"
919,Nice!
920,Love all the features especially the heart and pulse monitor it’s great
921,"I had the Apple Watch 6 before this one and although they are nearly the same size, the screen on the 8 is noticeably bigger. I like this because it makes the bezel even smaller and I can see more on the screen."
922,I purchased it for health and fitness. Very Happy with the device. It does every thing that I need and much more.
923,
924,I love how I can do so much with this watchIt charges so fast and keeps my day on track with my health
925,If you often work out. The Apple watch truly helps a lot. Also it can track your sleep which is also helpful for me.
926,"I love it, the color,the size, the apps"
927,Works really well and pleasantly surprised on battery life.
928,It’s amazing!!
929,"Very please with the watch and while it took a little longer to arrive than I thought, timing wasn't too bad.Pleased with it so far."
930,It's nice to get the S8 at a discounted price so shortly after launch! I went from a S6 in pink and I do like the starlight color.
931,nice but battery doesn't last as long as advertised.
932,"The sleep tracking is very interesting to learn about. Battery life is as advertised, I could go on and on."
933,"Love this watch! It’s sleek, very light on the wrist and has all sorts of cool features.Cons: the dial on the side does stick out a little to much for my complete comfort but I’ll get use to it."
934,I like how it reads O2 levels and body temps but it would be better if it took more readings through the day. Otherwise it’s great.
935,"No regrets, great buy from Amazon with 5% discount having  a Amazon reward member card"
936,How stupid it is to sell it would watch for this much money and not sell a charger then I have to pay 35 more dollars for a charger
937,"wow, the performance is so powerful. The 45mm dial without cellular technology is exactly what I need."
938,"I absolutely love my Apple Watch Series 8 GPS, the only downfall is that this requires a daily charge for sure."
939,Love its so much
940,It was my own fault.  But the watch was too small all the way around. The band and the watch.
941,Bigger face makes it easier to see and use. Oxygen sensor is great for anyone to be able to monitor their blood oxygen!  Lots better than my old 3 series!  Worth the upgrade!
942,Does not have cellular option
943,"Not very accurate. I sit most of my day for work, yet it tells me I stood for 8-10 hours. I doubt the steps tracking is very accurate. The battery life sucks and I don’t keep the screen on.  Overall, I feel like I wasted my money. I can’t stand the rubbery band."
944,"Mobile app, health applications and great battery life"
945,Really enjoying my Apple Watch
946,Didn’t like battery life
947,"I don't know much about Series 5-7. But if you have a 4, it's time to upgrade. This thing is awesome!"
948,Jumped from version 3 to 8. It worth
949,"Absolutely love my new watch, already had my phone updated to IOS 16 and didn’t have any issues pairing it. I do not regret my decision to buy this watch at all!"
950,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 My watch is beautiful 😍❤️🤗"
951,This watch is awesome! Highly recommend!
952,An amazing apple watch! It came just perfect and fits beautifully on my wrist:) I'm very happy!
953,"It was exactly what i had wanted, works perfectly, came relatively quickly, and works with everything I needed"
954,"Un Excelente producto, que mal que no todos los servicios están habilitados para Ecuador"
955,"This is a good watch, not outstanding. I honestly believe it is over priced. It really needs a charge every day. It is a bit clunky and not the most user friendly smart watch I have had. Yes, it has great features but they are not that easy to use. That said, it does what it says it will do."
956,Just as expected. Like watch
957,Love. So handy and worth the money
958,I returned the phone back in Oct. just a few days after receiving it. My refund on this date 11-15-22  has not been received.  Have made numerous calls but till keep calling.  Getting the run around.
959,The box was extremely dirty but I thought it was fine because I’ll never look at it again but the watch was dirty as well. When you sweat and have your watch on it leaves residue. That’s what I found on the watch.
