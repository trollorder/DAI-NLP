3,not used an apple watch but had other smart watch and now use only the fenix6 main reason i have tiny wrist and the battery life of small smart watch is terrible like not being confident it could finish tracking a 4 hour ride terrible so the simpler garmin sport watch is a win for me,"['Feelings', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.5196840167045593, 0.3076852560043335, 0.17263071238994598]",Feelings

6,the only reason i have an apple watch is due to travel when in a new area i can load a destination in google map and then put my phone in my pocket and start walking the google map apple watch app tell me when to turn guiding me to whatever location i want giving haptic feedback if i miss a turn or go in the wrong direction no phone in hand checking the screen frequently a you walk around it is a game changer if you travel a lot there is no google map nav on the fenix forerunner is and the 3rd party connect apps i tried were terrible,"['Feelings', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.4573519825935364, 0.36043021082878113, 0.18221786618232727]",Feelings

9,while the fitness feature on the garmin are awesome like you said with body battery yes i know i am tired with that said it is nice to be validated that i am not just being a baby the biggest reason i bought a fenix 7x is because it is feel bullet proof i am not worried about it bumping into thing not worried about water hurting it nothing i have played in snow climbed in rock ran in light rain hiked in heavy rain it just doe not matter that and physical button wa a huge point for me,"['Feelings', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.6720669865608215, 0.21818408370018005, 0.10974885523319244]",Feelings
