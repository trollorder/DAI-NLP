I saw some people received there’s in the original apple box, but that wasn’t the case for me. It arrived completely dead and not fully updated, which was simple to deal with but just a little bit of an inconvenience. On the plus side, the battery capacity was at 100%, which is great for a refurbished piece, maybe they replaced the battery. The glass screen of my watch also has a fairly large scratch on it, which was disappointing because I paid the extra money for “excellent condition”, and I personally wouldn’t consider it excellent. My watch didn’t come with the user manual, which I solved by just using the apple store website, but it would’ve been nice to have.Overall, this is a great option to save money but be weary of how it ships, I definitely think this store should invest in better shipping products (so that they aren’t liable for damage during shipping when the product was maybe in perfect condition before it was sent out)! The watch works fine and has great battery health, just a bit upset about the scratch since I paid for the excellent condition.","['Design Specifications', 'Advertising', 'Software']","[0.4326460361480713, 0.3324458599090576, 0.23490816354751587]",Design Specifications,['battery'],0.4326460361480713,NEGATIVE,0.9922069907188416,Capacity,0.5714179873466492,battery

927,"I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven't had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch's ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn't really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night.","['Design Specifications', 'Software', 'Advertising']","[0.4733229875564575, 0.3744864761829376, 0.15219052135944366]",Design Specifications,['battery'],0.4733229875564575,NEGATIVE,0.9991348385810852,Type,0.46291080117225647,battery

930,I had an Apple Watch 3 so this was a great upgrade. It has an abundance of Watch faces and can be customized. There are so many things it does that I am constantly finding new uses. Especially as it relates to health. The only drawback as always is the battery life. It does last longer than my Apple Watch 3 by several hours. So far I am very impressed. It is not cheap but you get what you pay for with all the features it contains.,"['Design Specifications', 'Software', 'Advertising']","[0.5149833559989929, 0.2657186686992645, 0.21929802000522614]",Design Specifications,['battery'],0.5149833559989929,POSITIVE,0.9929044842720032,Type,0.45878866314888,battery
