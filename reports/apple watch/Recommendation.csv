There are a few improvements that could be made to the Apple Watch. Firstly, enhancing the built-in speaker's quality and volume would improve the overall experience when playing music or receiving phone calls. Adding a Dolby Atmos speaker would also enhance the sound quality. Secondly, incorporating an option to switch between left and right audio would make it easier for users to customize their listening experience. Additionally, an extra button on the watch could provide more options for navigation. Improving the battery life would also be beneficial, as the current battery life is not very long.

rhythm and other stats he double checked with the machine and all after that he told me that maybe a series 7 or 8 would be nice cause it have other useful stats and i wa like ok then the doctor at the emergency room took my phone and did the exact same thing after spent the night at the emergency room i asked them about the watch they told me that they obviously double check everything with specialized machinery but the watch and phone give them an analysis of what wa happening earlier that day and week and is a reaaaally good addition now looking at the ultra i am tempted because battery alarm sound because i am 70percent deaf and all the stuff that the se do not have now is expensive but having those stuff make me feel a little le worried when i am outside in other country or similar situation i am not an extreme user a apple show in the video but i think all the people with heart disease love the watch and they could focus on that and have a lot of new potential user old people transplanted person etc', 'so lem me guess it straight apple expect u to buy a 1000dollar phone a 400 800dollar tablet and a 400 800dollar watch every 3 4 5 year a the battery becomes crap or the o becomes super outdated and or unsupported any middle class person who ha a family or a mortgage can not afford that crap unless you live on your credit card eat only unhealthy food like kraft diner r do not save money for rainy day it is not even close fun time we live in also all the environment friendly thing they claim to do when they try to push all these disposable gadget pure greenwashing android can be cheaper but is much worse for battery swapping or updating the o the only way i can afford gadget while paying my mortgage and being financially responsible saving money is buy them used in place like marketplace and run them into the ground until they basically explode', '2 5 day of battery charge will have to wait till it hit atleast 7 day since this will not do well

that is disposable in 5 year all these premium material in a disposable watch just doe not make sense with all the genius sitting at apple they need to re engineer the apple watch where you can replace the battery easily 4 screw and replace the battery i like to argue the the apple watch is more expensive that most swiss watch if you consider you have no watch after a few year it a houdini watch now you have it next you do not why did i come to this point i have the apple watch original series this is now considered vintage by apple can not service it the battery died i paid 1 099 for it in 2015 stainless and sapphire crystal 2015 wa not so long ago in the watch world this ultra watch will not even last 10 year so is not this so expensive to own and use you will be still rocking your rolex 30 year from now the economics of apple watch is just plain bad for u perfect for apple the richest company in the world', 'answering my own question it is stronger strong enough to feel during vigorous exercise i am also getting 4 5 day battery life the watch is the best apple watch by far 8 10', 'battery life is not anywhere what i need and you still need an iphone impressive

really liked my apple watch and what i wanted it to do i wanted it to track my sleep step and calorie i did not use most of the other stuff it could do i went over to a garmin forerunner 945 and like it too it doe a million thing i will never use but i literally get 8 10 day on a single charge i know there are a plethora of other smart watch that get 5 10 day on a single charge what the heck can not apple create a watch that doe that i am sure this new watch will get 3 5 day if you are not going crazy with every single feature for me i want sleep tracking step and track my workout that is it i might think about going back to the apple watch the ultra but 8 hundo is pretty steep my garmin wa 6 hundy which is a lot dollar200 more for the ultra it is dope though', 'el a g itr n it is not a bad watch but personally i like the garmin tactix better i have used the ultra in the same situation i use the delta and the feature are a little better garmin is just an all around outdoor watch the ultra is not bad but i would use it if i had to the battery life between them both is just not comparable so if your planing on being out for day at a time i would not recommend the ultra i got the ultra more for when i am on my bike especially using the gps feature for when i am in the road i did test it out in the wood and it not bad just try to cary an external power supply', 'ill stick to my garmin battery life is much better', 'haha battery life is the only reason i want this watch', 'why i left apple watch is because of battery life i can not enjoy wearing my apple watch for at least a week without having it charged everyday so i am currently wearing garmin tactix 7 pro ballistic it last me month or so without charging same material a the new apple watch ultra it ha more what can

outside and workout 5 day a week i feel like ultra is win for me and it different compared to other watch the battery life got my attention', 'maybe it is just not convenient for enough people but i use my galaxy watch for week to well over a month without charging becasue i put in on battery only mode when i am not in need of additional feature of course charging is not really an issue either

would be an apple watch that last 5 day which is great for a nice motorcycle trip or work week i wa really looking forward for the ultra but now i will look for an alternative', 'disappointing for price no built in navigation map like the garmin watch which do not require a cell signal or data to update and have 16 day battery life so ultra not a useful for serious hiker or pro outdoor type',

a smart watch tho with 28 day of battery life the ultra matron people will definitely not choose a apple watch because of comfort garmin ha the forerunner series for that a an armature athlete i use a

battery life i would argue that every single watch user would appreciate having that same battery life i think every user can take advantage of longer battery life not just pro user apple just chooses

nearly this long did you run yours in low battery mode for some of the time', 'a an avid hiker and fitness enthusiast i wa drawn to the ultra while the battery life is a key feature for me it is the ruggedness and lightweight body sold it for me i did not preorder at launch a i wanted to try it out and see how it looked it is a big watch and i have skinny wrist but i did not find it to be too big it arrives in two day so excited', 'to worth that price it need to have solar charging 2 day battery is nothing', 'i think the fact you did 6 hour of workout and got 2 full day is what will work for most of the target market anyway is there anything else out there with that quality and size of screen and the gps plus heart and that battery life i would have thought they would have made sure it would work for an ironman triathlon though i get the tradeoff of what is even possible should be enough for 99percent of people and scenario do i want one no not at all but i gave up long distance

the thing is just too big for me', 'i would have liked to buy one but it is the shape and battery that kill it for me and make me love my fenix even more common apple 7 10 day battery with 38h gps

great i invested in a garmin with a week is worth of battery if apple can do a apple watch with a week is battery of course le feature i definitely fall in that outer ring of people that have different need', 'hiker battery will not last mtie day with gps no map for navigation from what i have seen endurance athlete can not connect additional external sensor', 'if people spend big buck for case material and band a well a being part of the apple ecosystem why would not anybody anybody pay for a bigger screen longer battery life bigger control better gps better water resistance etc not just extreme athlete yes the normal watch is fine but we are talking about the apple universe', 'i just do not get the main appeal they basically make a sport watch my two year old not too of the line sport watch ha nearly all these feature is not a massive and the battery last nearly a week that is with having it on 24 7 and 1 3 hour of training six time a week oh and it cost dollar170 new not dollar800 but oooo apple so i have to get it', 'i am not an extreme athlete far from it actually i just happen to do a little of everything the apple watch ultra touch i dive very casually swim way more often i hike and camp occasionally but never too far off a beaten path i also run and ride bike though never in the same day that said i still want the apple watch ultra the battery life is the biggest reason i have held back on getting an apple watch i just do not enjoy having to charge my phone my laptop and my watch every day i have plenty of mechanical watch that i love just having around being able to tell time no matter when i need it it doe not need battery yet get the time down to the second what a beautiful example of engineering but a an it professional i do not get the luxury to be truly on vacation some time i need to monitor my computer even when i am out and about i need to be able to check my email and slack when i am on the beach this is the one thing my mechanical watch can not do my iphone can but it is not ever present like a watch is the apple watch ultra with the battery optimization option is perfect for me i can probably get through the majority of my vacation charging only once midway and i would never need the constant ping for anything health related just a general trend and min max range is plenty now i have an apple watch that is right for me i can dress up my mechanical watch and i will dress down and use the apple watch ultra for casual outing and travel', 'can not really compare a casio watch battery to an apple watch battery slight difference in processor power', 'huawei best in smartwatch battery life', 'i am not in any of the market classification but that battery life is very pulling i am not a sport person but i do depend on my watch quite a bit for navigation and such and those burn through the battery like nothing only 50dollar difference from my usual 749dollar on top of that not bad at all', 'why 800dollar i have xiaomi s1 26 day battery cost just 120 dollar', 'you already got 60 hr of battery 2 full day 2 full night into the 3rd day with 20percent left so 24x2 12 60hrs just a thought',

with ao turned off started at 100percent so about 8h it would have been dead', 'cory kroneman true but older garmins do not have all the feature you are going to find on this ultra like anything it is a trade off if you are running ultramarathons you probably know this watch is not for you based solely on the battery life hopefully apple can continue to improve the battery life but like any product it is not for everyone for me a someone who doe a lot of rock climbing and marathon the battery life is suitable for my need i am not running or climbing for 24 straight hour', 'this watch will never make it through a full ironman in it current form assuming you are going to be 12h there are quite a few video of people going for 50k run and putting the watch through 8h of gps hr etc and finishing with sub 30percent battery life marathon 1 2 ironman you are good to go 100 mile run is also a no go assuming you are an average runner that will take 24h for a 100 mile run i used the polar m for imwi19 and just made it used both the polar m and a garmin vivoactive 4 for my first 50 miler in october 2020 about 11h run probably 25 30percent battery still remaining this is a great watch but no where near older garmins', '2 58 i feel like if this thing ha 2 5 day of battery life with regular use it will not cut it for ultra runner and long distance hiker with contant gps recording no way not even if you triple the battery life with that upcoming feature but of course that is the need of one in a thousand looking great though', 'all those feature and yet battery life is not great nah will stick to withings with the 30 day battery life and meet all the necessary need', 'it is the battery and screen size that sold me if the 8 had that battery amp screen size i would go with the 8 and not the ultra', 'great review well done one thing that you did not mention that is important to me is that the battery is replaceable for dollar99 but otherwise without applecare the cost of any other repair is out of sight i am getting an ultra but despite the fact that it is big and a bit of bling it ha the feature and ruggedness that every smartwatch and the other apple watch should have i own an apple watch 6 gps while functioning a a little iphone on your wrist cellular i have a cardiac condition want 911 calling everywhere longer battery life resistance to high pressure water my sprinkler system when i work on it and supposedly better temperature resistance i will see how it last outside in 106 deg f texas heat i like to go hiking so the more accurate gps under tree cover or in big city where did i park my car etc is a plus too for such an expensive watch it is a shame if it eventually obsoleted by not being upgradeable to a future watchos five year or so would be a pretty limited lifetime for a good watch', 'shocking to me apple top smartwatch ha some great feature with the increased size but they sacrifice the battery life a top end smartwatch should have for example garmin top watch speak about battery in length of day not 2 night 2 day if that make sense my current garmin fenix ha not been charged in two day and i have literally 28 day of battery left lol', '2 day and 2 night of battery life lmfao that is really not that great', 'for me a watch must be something we never want to taken care of but something we can rely upon all the time the real not so smart watch remaining that way for long time it the core of timekeeping there is a lot of people need a smart watch with even long battery life atleast a week how a smart watch becomes smart when it need your attention in every two day it just a wearable health band not a real watch apple can add their pro tag when they found a solution for this problem', 'for yor notice huawei gt watch battery life is one week to two week which you can forget to charge your watch everyday', 'wow a whole 2 day of battery life really guy it is not worth it', 'never would have worn an apple watch the battery is in a word horrendous that said they got me my ultra come on monday', 'in the intro the airpod battery sound got me', 'i personally like large face watch still love my stainless steel series 4 although old and the battery is not what it used to be this 49mm look awesome to me if you went with aw ultra you better get applecare with this the repair to this watch are insanely expensive also the problem with apple watch and many smart watch is the battery will die even bulge eventually which happened to my original aw1 now apple may replace the battery aka send you a replacement watch for dollar79 or charge you a lot more and charge you far more than the watch is worth trade in is with aw is are abysmal also you may drop dollar399 on a regular aw7 8 and the value of that the following year will plummet 60 70percent older series may be worth 10 buck or apple will give dollar0 00 except the offer for them to recycle it for you will ultra drop 40 60 70percent in value next year a a trade in no idea', 'dollar800 and only 2 day battery lol', 'two plus day of battery life what i do not need the ultra but i might get it just for the battery life alone', 'a an ultra runner and an alpinist i have been waiting for this watch for quite some time i love my series 7 but would have to put it in theater mode to extend the life over my ultras and even then it would die soon after the end of the run i wa about to order a garmin when i got wind that apple wa making a watch for ultra athlete they knocked it out of the park for the ultra athlete with this watch for alpine setting we frequently get an alpine start when summiting a big mountain start around midnight and climb all night to try and catch the sunrise this extended battery life red filter and waypoints are perfect for big mountain the only thing missing which i am sure will make it in the future is the emergency satellite communication that iphone 14 ha', 'i went on holiday for 8 night with my garmin venu 2 plus and did not have to charge it once 2 3 day of battery life is not that great', 'my amazfit gts 2 mini last 2 week with the same usage my apple watch se the new one last 1 day it is battery life is absolutely horrible', 'not bad but battery still is not good enough compared to my garmin watch', 'this is the video i needed to make up my mind on purchasing the ultra i honestly do not do none of the diving hiking or extreme sport but i am a nurse and ever since covid 19 happened i have been doing 12 to 16 hr shift so having an apple watch that the battery last that long is so helpful due to the longer shift and such i barely got time to make sure that my device are charged so this is perfect', 'no matter how good it is when i go for a weekend camping it take more than 36 hour so to me it is just an useless weight on my wrist it is still a toy for a walk in the local park and yes there are many watch like garmin on the market that are very functional with a decent battery life', 'no one is talking about the battery life that is the deal breaker in my case do not want to have ti charge a watch too every other day better off sticking with android smart watch 2 week battery life or garmin 3 to 4 week', 'yeah the battery would still be an issue for a true exploration that take multiple day', 'main reason people do extreme sport and generally not everyday stuff need to have these bulky watch that have button and are not so expensive no need for internet connection on your watch and update etc yes the new apple watch is actually a pretty good watch but when you will get lost in the mountain you wont need only 2 day and 2 night and a third day of battery time', 'i wa in that boat with my 5 until he said about the battery', 'the battery life is not enough i use an ipad an iphone but my smart watch have been fitbit previously and i have the garmin fenix 6x sapphire for the past 2 and half year 2 week battery life with the ultra battery life it would not be enough for the target map esp hiker and diver where they can be off track for a few day', 'that battery life is unbelievable i play football and basketball and the way you used your apple watch is exactly how i would a a weekend sport watch amazing', 'a one of those weird ultra runner people who currently us a garmin fenix these are watch that have 60 hour battery life in all system gps mode plus use on single gps satellite at more than that and an extended battery life mode like you are talking with this watch that go into the hundred of hour and expedition mode which last literally week while still periodically pinging gps i get topo map downloaded natively for free and for doing multi day run hike with gps still left on so i can go back and have fun analyzing all my data i like having way more battery than i need and being able to not think about how much battery i have when i set out a i know that even if i go out for a 10 hour saturday excursion im covered and didnt have to plan out my charging knowing there is that much battery to spare give peace of mind and a the watch and battery age it give that much more buffer before battery degradation make me want to get a new watch this all is cool but if you watch dc rainmaker review he also note that the garmin watch coros etc all have very very detailed training mode and metric calculated in each profile and not just different name applied to basically the same meterics for different sport', 'battery life need to last at least 5 day apple should have implemented solar cell to help extend the battery life i am not going to

thinking my airpods battery wa dead', 'i am not an athlete by any mean but i have been looking to upgrade my now over 2 year old series 5 and the more i think about the ultra the more it make sense even for me double the battery life mean theoretically double the battery lifespan plus the crown guard is also super appealing i often have a case on mine not so much for protection but more so to stop me from accidentally pressing it and activating siri whenever i bend my wrist back like when pushing up off something to stand i have pretty dainty wrist though so i definitely need to try and find one in store somewhere to try on', 'did he seriously just compare a smartwatch is battery life to a regular watch is battery life', 'first one min is how good is battery can you do after 2 year

7 graphite i tried a garmin for me apple hit a sweet spot i wa already ready to pay this premium and i wanted something more rugged and had a longer battery i am hoping it arrives before this camping trip this weekend keeping my series 7 for other occasion apple knew exactly what to give u and leave u wanting more it is another apple watch', 'made me want to get the watch again had the original apple watch then the series 5 and ended up just never wanting to charge it it would almost always be dead when on my wrist and after updating the firmware the following year it just stopped working all together and while i arranged for apple support to fix it i never sent it to them for repair cause i just never really used it mainly again for low battery performance but your analysis make me interested again a always m b love your thoroughness', 'close but still not there for backpacking sure the garmins etc are not a smart but you can go a week in the backcountry without carrying an external power bank and battery tech just is not there yet to match that with this kind of watch maybe once solid state battery hit the market', 'it just need 4 full day of battery while using half the time with gps tracker enabled backpacking trip and hunting trip could then fit in this group but garmin is 20 day battery and 5 day with gps enabled is unmatched', 'a a hiker 2 day battery life is not good at all garmin is a top tier watch for hiking because it can last longer than a month', 'i really wonder if you could make like a dynamo driven automatic smart watch like an automatic watch but with a dynamo recharging the battery of the smart watch giving you some extra battery life maybe even infinite battery life packaging would be a nightmare though', 'it is the size of a dead turtle

brought it 4 year ago just for 140 usd and it is working fine without any issue', 'a a dude with no job and a recluse all the extreme extra feature is really not important to me im just getting it for the better battery the brighter screen and the overall bigger watch', 'a a garmin fenix 6x pro solar amp apple watch 6 owner i think this standard of the battery must last a month is a bit irrational and overblown for 95percent of people who make that argument and not a feature that most fitness watch user actually use or need case in point how many people complain that their cellphone doe not last a month no one why well that is unrealistic and also because charging your phone is not a big deal why is charging your watch suddenly a big deal not many real world reason it is just a feature that we are used not and not one we actually use first i bet most fitness watch user do not go week without charging their watch secondly it is not much of an inconvenience to charge apple watch once a day or once every couple of day unless you really want to track sleep and even then when you wake up you can put it on the fast charger while you get ready for the next hour then throw it on for the rest of the day thirdly one of the reason why multi week battery life is likely a big deal is because charging most other fitness watch is clumsy and not convenient my garmin fenix 6x pro solar ha a wonky proprietary charger and it is not very convenient to charge so i rarely make the effort to charge it my apple watch on the other hand is super easy to charge with it is magnetic wireless charger so i think this whole battery must last a month is just a talking point rather than a feature that most fitness watch user actually use and when they do it is likely because charging is not easy and intuitive this requirement is like pixel peeping with pro camera doe it actually make a real world difference no it is simple to charge your watch every 1 3 day', 'i have had the apple watch suunto 9 baro and currently have the garmin 6x doing the usual mountain stuff in colorado west and the traditional apple watch battery life just did not cut it for my purpose this one is interesting but my garmin 6x get about 9 hard day of daily wear mountain activity can not beat it if i just wore it without working out every day which probably will never happen you could get 10 full day out of a single charge of course the garmin doe not have the same or close feature but for a mountain athlete it crush', 'my honor band give me more than two week of battery life and this piece of expensive cake last just 2 day pro', 'and yeah that battery life is only just going to make the length of the offshore race i do', 'i think the watch is going to be amazing and can not wait for mine to be

another stopwatch but can track your heart rate measure the amount of caloreis that you have burned after training and stay on your wrist while you run something that have i have kind of noticed is

diving computer my fenix and the watch which i prefer for body metric and integration with my other apple product easily come out at 1200 buck i am not yet convinced because especially the sensor

it is capability but at the end the ultra is still very much tied to it original apple watch gene in contrast company like garmin coros suunto go from the outside in they concentrate first on giving athlete the most useful feature long battery gps heart rate o2 sat training zone sleep tracking etc and truly excel at those metric then they toss in a few of the most useful connectivity feature like call text notification so the main question becomes what role you want your smartwatch to play in your life or training if you want your watch to be an active extension clone of your phone then the

but is that a static 100m most true dive watch are rated for 200 300m because when you are moving the watch around under water you put a lot more pressure on the seal and entry point than just having it sit there 99 99percent of diver will not go to 200m but that is not what the rating actually mean also for those who are doing multi day hike in the backcounty the extra battery life is great but when you are constantly running gps to track your mileage and route compass etc that battery life i am sure is much lower than the rating so it is great for maybe 1 2 full day of hiking but what about multi day excursion i doubt it would last for a 2 3 day backpacking trip with all the function running it is definitely a good step for the casual outdoors person but for my more hardcore outing i will stick with my garmin fenix and i do use an apple watch for everyday work around home purpose it is a much better smartwatch but it is not purpose built the way garmin etc are', 'the battery

Originally I was nervous because it seemed like the battery life wasn’t very good but after a full charge it lasts a long time.', 'So I’ve read multiple reviews about how it was iCloud activation locked, but when I got mine it worked perfectly with no trouble at all now I haven’t tested the battery but at this point In time I believe that it will last two days, only reason I’m giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because I received the band box and the Apple Watch box without the main box that holds them together, the packaging  for both boxes looked excellent, but as soon as I opened it the packaging looked ripped, I’m pretty sure Renewed Apple watches need to be sealed back up to ensure quality, but it’s whatever I got a perfect band, and almost brand new Apple Watch considering it’s been used!!!', 'Watch face is in new like condition and it came with a new looking cord but in a plain cardboard  box not an apple box like I was hoping for. Works fine battery life is ok a little less than my other watch.', 'my daughter wears this on schooltime mode during the day yet when she gets home from school it only has like 20% battery life.  constantly  have to charge it.  poor battery life.', ""FYI You need iPhone and a wall charger, but I knew that going in.I received the package fast and secured. I had to charge the watch for 30 minutes before syncing it with my phone. The battery works great and I got great use out of it on the first day! It came with two bands of different sizes and it works great. I did have to turn off the zoom setting on the watch. Overall 10/10 experience. I love all the information that comes with it about how it's a refreshed or refurbished item and its warranty. Thank you so much!"", ""Ordered the one with the abyss blue band, but instead they sent a white. They don't even show a white-banded one on their listing so I don't know what's up with that. Otherwise it's absolutely fine: 90% battery health, a few minor blemishes on the back of the casing (which are invisible when wearing), and no conspicuous issues with the hardware or software."", ""I hated it because the battery drained so fast and I thought it might even be defective. I looked up a lot of guides on turning off certain settings that aren't important to me and my battery lasts a whole day even with a workout now."", 'I was worried that bc it was a renewed product I wasn’t going to be satisfied. That it would perform at lower quality than new. I was wrong, it was in perfect condition it has held the battery life and works great. Very happy with my decision to buy renewed.', 'i liked everything! the battery life is great, the mobile set up was amazing and it’s very easy to configure, all around a great product for the low price!', 'The battery only lasted about 5 hours so I had to return the watch unfortunately.', 'I’m very happy with my purchase, the Apple Watch didn’t come in the original box but all the accessories were original. It didn’t have any scratches, battery life was 100%. Unfortunately, I had an error because I couldn’t activate the watch using my phone, it said “Unable to Check for Updates” but I went to an Apple Store and they kindly help me to solve and it works perfectly now. The product is literally new and it helped me save a couple of dollars. I would totally recommend buying Amazon renewed products, it worths the price.', 'Item arrived as described so far very good. In original packaging apple was able to get battery charged to 100% no issues or concerns yet- have only had item for 2 days. Great value for $ like new', 'Bad battery', 'Charged right up and paired with my phone. Tracks activity well. So far so good on the battery life. I’m super impressed and really love it!', 'They installed the battery magnet backwards so it repels the charger. The fact this got sent out without being checked beats me.  I wouldn’t not trust any product from them given they obviously do not QC there products', 'It look like new but battery life is bad can’t even last a day', 'Looks brand new. Came in a sealed box. The battery life ran out quite quickly. Less than a day so that’s concerning. And to kick the charger that was included doesn’t work. Or atleast I hope it’s the charger. Will update when I spend $30 on a new one today. Pretty upset about that as I went with this refurbished model to save money.', 'Watch looks brand new and everything seemed fine until I started using it and....... the battery life is terrible!!!It only lasts about 2 hours while tracking a workout and then it dies. Even when I put it on airplane mode it dies super quick.Terrible battery life. Super frustrated with this purchase.', 'I love the gorgeous red of this watch. The watch was packaged nicely. The instructions were easy to follow. This watch is so much more advanced than my Fitbit. I love all the numerous features and learn something new and cool every day about it!  I was surprised by the battery life but it makes sense since I have it set to flash on at every movement but it charges incredibly fast! I was shocked when I realized my iPhone charger block wouldn’t have the same connections for me to charge my watch. I was able to find an adapter on Amazon pretty easily.', ""I'm not sure if it's just me, but the battery life sucks. It lasts about a day a half, and that's with turning off at night. You really can't use it during the day and expect to use the sleep tracking and health tracking features at night because it would need to be charged the next day. My series 3 had a much better battery life."", 'Great size, and great Apple item, but battery life too short.', 'I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven\'t had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch\'s ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn\'t really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night.', 'I finally gave up on my Fitbit. Too many little things. I resisted the Apple Watch for many years due to the short battery life. I use my watch for both health and sleep tracking, so wanted a once-a-day charge schedule.This watch delivers!  Because there is no Cell Radio, after 24 hrs I still have 40% battery left!  This is useable and I’m very pleased.', 'I had an Apple Watch 3 so this was a great upgrade. It has an abundance of Watch faces and can be customized. There are so many things it does that I am constantly finding new uses. Especially as it relates to health. The only drawback as always is the battery life. It does last longer than my Apple Watch 3 by several hours. So far I am very impressed. It is not cheap but you get what you pay for with all the features it contains.', 'i got this as a christmas present for my mom. she loves it so much!! it came really quick. the apple box wasn’t damaged in any way. she only had it for a couple days but her sleep tracking is very accurate & the battery life has lasted her a long while. i highly recommend!', 'Have not used for sleeping and still too new to rate battery life. It does record ekg readings and much much more.. make sure to watch utube videos on all the cool things this tracker can do.', 'My wife loves everything about it, the only negative thing is you have to charge the battery every 18 to 20 hours', ""It's really a nice thing, but the battery needs constant charging, which is the only drawback"", 'Not very accurate. I sit most of my day for work, yet it tells me I stood for 8-10 hours. I doubt the steps tracking is very accurate. The battery life sucks and I don’t keep the screen on.  Overall, I feel like I wasted my money.

It arrived completely dead and not fully updated, which was simple to deal with but just a little bit of an inconvenience. On the plus side, the battery capacity was at 100%, which is great for a refurbished piece, maybe they replaced the battery. The glass screen of my watch also has a fairly large scratch on it, which was disappointing because I paid the extra money for “excellent condition”, and I personally wouldn’t consider it excellent. My watch didn’t come with the user manual, which I solved by just using the apple store website, but it would’ve been nice to have.Overall, this is a great option to save money but be weary of how it ships, I definitely think this store should invest in better shipping products (so that they aren’t liable for damage during shipping when the product was maybe in perfect condition before it was sent out)! The watch works fine and has great battery health, just a bit upset about the scratch since I paid for the excellent condition.', 'Overall the watch is great. It looks new and works great.

Customers would appreciate a longer battery life, especially if it lasts at least two full days without needing to be charged. Additionally, better sleep tracking features could be added to the watch, which would make it a valuable tool for users who want to monitor their sleep patterns.

It has NOT EVEN hit 75% after a FULL 8 HOURS. I think the battery life is really impressive!COSMETICALLY:This watch is in REALLY GOOD condition considering it is secondhand/refurbished. I received mine with only ONE TINY CHIP to the screen.**I genuinely think this is not a watch to pass up. If you’re considering it, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going through all of the apps that come on it and remove unnecessary ones as well as turning off any background processes.
