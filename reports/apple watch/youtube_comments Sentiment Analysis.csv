35,i had a couple thing about the ultra that made me decide against buying it the biggest issue wa it is large to fit comfortably on my wrist and the watch can be a bit heavy the thing also wa the ultra wa hard to put under my long sleeve shirt i have smaller then normal hand and wrist for a man and the ultra wa just to large heavy and awkward for me being that i am retired and wanted an apple watch to monitor my heart and temperature reading i went to the series 8 41 mm i do not need cellular connection on the watch a i have my phone with me all the time i just could not justify spending another dollar120 00 a year added to my cellular plan and having a extra dollar100 00 for the watch the ultra is just not what i wanted and the se just wa not enough i also do not really have a use for the stainless model so i went with the aluminum the way to save money is also fish for the discount and by a short fishing trip over to the apple veteran and military website i found 10percent off on the site so that dollar400 00 watch wa dollar360 00 the ultra is just to much and the se not enough and the series 8 wa just right my pervious apple watch wa the original version that lasted until last month before the battery died so this wa a nice update,NEGATIVE,0.9963219165802002

1470,one thing no reviewer seems to cover is the discomfort level of this watch i have worn every apple watch since apple watch 1 day and night and after wearing the ultra for 2 day and night straight the bone under my watch started to feel sore such that i had to take the watch off briefly for relief i thought i am wearing it too tight but after another day of adjustment i gave up a my wrist could no longer bear it comparing it with my apple watch 5 which i replaced i noticed the glass used for the bottom sensor is more pronounced ha more depth and roundness and literally dig into your wrist this digging into my wrist wa what wa giving me the sore bone this and the discomfort when scrubbing the crown a it wa very abrasive to my skin touching it a the crown would push the watch down every time i would turn it the crown is big ha sharp edge and pinch the top surface also ha a very edgy sharp wall around it for protection but if you have got the habit of swiping from the edge of the screen a you would on older generation your finger will swipe over the sharp edge and it is not a pleasant experience the additional weight of the watch the constant pinching soreness uncomfortable overall squareness a it sits tall on your wrist leaning on one side wa just too much to handle overall i gave up after 3 day and am returning it i can not imagine wearing this thing day in and day out including while i sleep to put thing into perspective i am an avid runner very active during the day use the watch for sleep tracking i do not have skinny wrist and have no other medical condition or allergy this wa a dream watch replacement for me until it became obvious it is not from the picture it feel the normal apple watch 8 also seems to have added an additional height to the bottom sensor which may result in similar discomfort although i am not sure a the watch itself is lighter so it may be easier to wear all the time,NEGATIVE,0.998126208782196

1654,great review but i think you are missing a massive subset of potential user people who need a simple rugged watch with increased battery life such a police fire and em the apple watch failed in two aspect prior it wa not rugged enough for job that require a more physical nature and the battery life required to frequent charging given some occupation is shift some firefighter and em work 48hr shift a typical apple watch would not make it through one complete shift on a single charge but taking the watch off at night to charge it would not be feasible the ultra is the first apple watch that is on the job compliant in that it can last an entire shift plus is hearty enough to take the daily physical abuse running an ultra marathon or scuba diving is a niche market that is over glamorized for apple is marketing making a watch that police fire em can wear now that is breaking into an untapped market,NEGATIVE,0.9014620184898376

2284,the biggest thing that hold me back from this is how apple tends to work by debuting a look for one device you know on the back end similar device will be following suit shortly after so do i need the ultra for the larger flat screen or just wait one more year when the 9 debut and likely ha this look or something similar i have already made the personal decision that outside of the louder speaker and the action button everything else is not a necessary for my daily use or lifestyle it is a dope look either way but justifying the extra dollar200 did not quite add up great in depth look at thing though much appreciated,NEGATIVE,0.9953539371490479

5556,smartwatches sadly still have some degree of compromise you can actually buy a smartwatch with a replaceable cell battery that last for an entire year but the catch is that the watch is a hybrid smartwatch and hybrid smartwatches prioritise being a watch over being a smart device ironically the first ever smartphone that paired to a phone wa actually a hybrid smartwatch the sony ericsson mbw 100 this watch wa a mechanical watch with an led display at the bottom for notification and music and had playback control on the side and incredibly there are still watch that follow similar principle the most modern one i have seen use e ink display a the watch face with hand that will move out of the way whenever you get a notification or navigate through certain menu and setting one of the popular example of a watch with this setup being fossil is hybrid hr watch these however do not have replaceable battery but do have rechargeable battery that only need recharging once every 2 week but another type is a hybrid watch that ha no display at all and will instead point to a number on the dial that you can assign to notification relating to an app or a contact personally i have not had a good experience with fossil is version of these watch on android i had syncing issue and on io it would only accept notification from apps that fossil had personally whitelisted no idea why especially since their hybrid hr watch support all apps but that is how it is but there are other company that make these including none other than armani these watch look like normal watch and do not use much power which is how they are able to keep going for an entire year or more but yeah i have not seen a single hybrid that support third party application and sadly they are rather underrated a watch sure they are more minimalist when it get to functionality but they do have a kind of secret agent spy watch kind of quality to them that i think make them stand out,NEGATIVE,0.9986698627471924
5557,i do triathlon and diving but i will not be getting this for everyday use i might however get it for those activity to be able to track both i would normally need both a sport watch for 400 500 and a dive computer for a much now i can get both in one and it will also go into my apple activity tracking and so it becomes a watch to wear on race day or dive day rather than just for the activity and then i will keep the s5 for my daily use where the ultra look too out of place i think for endurance athlete and diver it is not necessarily a daily driver but rather a better and sleeker alternative to the sport dive watch,NEGATIVE,0.9891582727432251

5559,drawing on marque analogy apple is expanding from the inside out that is they take their standard watch and basically double it is capability but at the end the ultra is still very much tied to it original apple watch gene in contrast company like garmin coros suunto go from the outside in they concentrate first on giving athlete the most useful feature long battery gps heart rate o2 sat training zone sleep tracking etc and truly excel at those metric then they toss in a few of the most useful connectivity feature like call text notification so the main question becomes what role you want your smartwatch to play in your life or training if you want your watch to be an active extension clone of your phone then the apple watch and the new ultra make sense if you want the best athletic computer to guide your workout while not missing important text or phone call then garmin coros suunto have you covered,POSITIVE,0.9786027073860168

5674,definitely a great evolution for the apple watch but i wonder if the upgraded feature are truly enough for the hardcore adventurer for example 100m water resistance will take you deeper but is that a static 100m most true dive watch are rated for 200 300m because when you are moving the watch around under water you put a lot more pressure on the seal and entry point than just having it sit there 99 99percent of diver will not go to 200m but that is not what the rating actually mean also for those who are doing multi day hike in the backcounty the extra battery life is great but when you are constantly running gps to track your mileage and route compass etc that battery life i am sure is much lower than the rating so it is great for maybe 1 2 full day of hiking but what about multi day excursion i doubt it would last for a 2 3 day backpacking trip with all the function running it is definitely a good step for the casual outdoors person but for my more hardcore outing i will stick with my garmin fenix and i do use an apple watch for everyday work around home purpose it is a much better smartwatch but it is not purpose built the way garmin etc are,NEGATIVE,0.9835521578788757

8653,quick tip for my fellow menstruators if you use apple is tracker and plan on using the temp sensor feature to enhance tracking consider waiting until after the holiday before you buy this watch or enable the feature my tracking wa pretty accurate before but last month the estimation wa a week later than reality it feel like it is been areset by the watch and need more time in order to become accurate again right now it is estimating for me to start on thanksgiving and christmas and i have no idea if that is true or not this is anecdotal of course but seriously if what you are doing right now work consider leaving it alone till after the holiday edit 1 month later after the first inaccurate cycle it seems on track again not enough time to say it is more accurate than before but it is already back to the same accuracy a before what a relief i had a cold and fever a couple week ago and wondered how it might affect the conclusion of the algorithm but it seemed to handle that just fine without getting thrown off the temperature spike is visible on the graph it would be nice if they could use this capability in a future update to maybe alert for the presence of fever after learning an individual is baseline temp,NEGATIVE,0.9789322018623352

12978,just purchased a 45mm series 8 in graphite stainless steel it is my first apple watch and i liked the idea of the increased durability also best buy had them on sale for dollar70 off i have primarily used fitbits and i always ding up the aluminum body that coupled with the continuous reduction of feature or putting them behind a paywall finally made me move on i am pretty excited for when it get here,POSITIVE,0.9341824650764465
12979,i feel like the most important part for the newer watch is the fast charging put it on the charger after dinner while watching show or doing dish and get it to 100percent in no time flat that way you can wear it to bed and all day the next day and it becomes more like a non 1 day battery plus sleep tracking that is the reason i will not get an se model,NEGATIVE,0.9976059198379517

12984,ultra great watch for hairdresser can not see why anyone else would be interested marketed a a great yuppie outdoor watch there are much better dedicated one out there same go for a a sport watch which serious athlete would actually wear that good battery life for the size of a brick and cellular too many hidden cost most people who would go for that would be to old to understand or use half the feature anyway like the actual look and design but still way too big,NEGATIVE,0.9981934428215027
12985,thanks for the review i like how you speak a a consumer to the consumer i find that pretty cool since a lot of reviewer wanting to strike that balance somehow do not pull it off a well a for the watch i picked up the s8 45mm midnight unfortunately it still ha not arrived i hope a a non apple watch user i am going to dig it i have the first gen galaxy watch which i enjoyed but it is time to lay to rest because well apple ecosystem i like a big interface with bell and whistle however i will not bite on the ultra it is simply unnecessary for my need also i am trying to get out of the vicious cycle in tech of owning the latest and the greatest which frankly is a bottomless pit too many consumer i wa one of them fall prey to,NEGATIVE,0.9968603849411011

13109,ordered the ultra day one i am a mechanical watch collector if you are in the hobby it mean you also collect watch strap and metal watch bracelet by far the strongest selling point for me with the ultra is the new ocean band specifically the yellow ocean band essentially the biggest reason i am buying the ultra is the new ocean band and all the feature of the ultra watch itself just happen to be icing on the cake if my prior apple watch wa not the smaller 41mm incompatible size then i would simply buy the new ocean band separately for dollar99 but i need to upgrade to the larger size apple watch in any event to have an apple watch compatible with the size of the new ocean band which band is of course made for the 49mm ultra but compatible with 45mm apple watch i believe very few people know what the ocean band actually is and what a big deal it is first if you know anything about the history of the design of the apple watch then you know that the primary designer of the apple watch or at least the person who originally developed the design idea s which were used in the creation of the apple watch is marc newson then going further down the rabbit hole long before apple developed the apple watch newson designed ikepod watch not ipod but ikepod yep originally just pod and there wa an ikepod dive watch model called seaslug which included an extremely unique and innovative rubber strap from which apple is new ocean band no doubt got it origin to me the addition of the drilled out tubular hole in the ocean band make it even cooler a an aside if you did not already know the design for the regular original rubber strap for the apple watch wa taken straight from ikepod watch,NEGATIVE,0.9965680837631226
