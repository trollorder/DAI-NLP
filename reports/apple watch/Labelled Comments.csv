I didn't think there would be much use for it other than the fitness tracker but I was pleasantly surprised. The fitness tracking is great but I am highly suspicious of the estimated calories burned when tracking traditional weight training. Having Apple Pay on your wrist is really convenient and the walkie-talkie function is super cool. I also like how you can answer phone calls from your wrist in case your phone isn't on you at the time. I am terrible about charging my devices so I wish the battery life was better but you can get through a solid day and a half if you aren't fiddling with the watch too much.

157,"If you are having trouble pairing this to your iPhone please read the following review. First you must have an iPhone 8 or newer model. Second, and most importantly, you must be running iOS 16 or greater. I got this watch a few days ago and I could not wait to pair it with my iPhone 13.It would pair then unpair and over and over again. I tried to manually pair it, I reset my phone, the watch, my network settings (all of these tips were found online) but none of them mentioned needing the latest iOS. My phone updates automatically so I assumed I was on the latest iOS. I was not.It took me about 45 minutes for the phone and watch to update and finally pair.This watch is good but not great. The battery life is just not there yet. If you want to wear this watch for the fitness aspect of it and track your sleep data as well as have it as a shortcut to read messages and see notifications throughout the day it doesn’t give you much time during the day or night to charge it. I did all the battery saving tips and it was still only good for about a day and a half. Kinda like my phone. And it gets worse if you want full functionality.I also wanted to use this with my Arccos golf tracking system but the battery really goes quick using gps for an entire round of golf and it does not give you anything more than a very plain numeric only display with basic yardages. It was very comfortable to wear and it does have very cool customizable watch faces but the poor battery life was a deal breaker.

The battery is still at 50% at the end of the day when I place it on the charging puck, so the battery life is great in spite of the constant on display.

Having all of those features constantly monitoring for changes drains the battery quicker than I’d like. Note that I dimmed the brightness of the display and turned off the “always on” feature. It helped a bit but to get the most out of the battery, you’ll have to turn off the active monitoring features.Low power mode is always an option if you’re really needing to conserve battery but it turns off 99 percent of features to do this.I have a charger nearby 95 percent of the time so that minimizes the issue somewhat.I‘d give it a half star back if that was an option (so realistically a 4.5 out of 5)Some people will say get the Ultra if you need a better battery, but I couldn’t justify $800.","['Advertising', 'Design Specifications', 'Software']","[0.49047547578811646, 0.3051680624485016, 0.20435649156570435]",Advertising,"['display', 'battery']",0.49047547578811646

186,"UPGRADES from Series 7:S8 Chip:  This is basically the same as the S7 chip, with a few new integrated sensors:--Temperature Sensors:  Measures wrist temp. only while sleeping, takes five days to build baseline.  Currently only used to help retroactively analyze ovulation cycles after two cycles.  Not predictive.--High G accelerometer and improved gyroscope:  Able to detect car crashes and call for help.  (Same feature available in iPhone 14)-Different Color options: (Currently no blue or green?)That’s it.  Everything else is exactly the same as the Series 7.  The only way I can even tell them apart is by the color, otherwise they look the same.  The only benefits to upgrading to a Series 8 from a Series 7 would be the improved ovulation tracking features via nighttime wrist temperature, (though Apple warns that this is not necessarily predictive and should only be used to retroactively analyze your cycles after a couple months of use, and you would have to be wearing it at night often because this feature only uses sleep temp data), or the car-crash detection (but if you are going to get an iPhone 14, then this feature will be in your phone already).  So, if you are not interested in the ovulation data (or just don’t want to wear the watch every night- because maybe you charge it at night), and you plan to get an iPhone 14, then there is no reason to upgrade to this Series 8 at all.  The series 8 does come with Watch OS 9 which has some new software features, but all Apple Watches Series 4 or later can upgrade to this same OS 9.  (So that is Series 4, 5, 6, and 7, and SE, all support upgrading to Watch OS 9)So basically, it is hard to recommend getting this Watch Series 8.  If you can live without the wrist temp ovulation analysis and car crash detection in the watch, then I would suggest sticking with Series 7.  Even Series 6 isn’t that different in terms of performance, it and will still support Watch OS 9.  If you are buying your first Apple Watch, I would still suggest getting the less expensive Series 7.  Or you could also look into the new SE 2, which is about $150 less expensive than this Series 8, but lacks several other features like the Always-On-Display, ECG, blood oxygen and IP6X rating.","['Software', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.8302177786827087, 0.08892852067947388, 0.08085371553897858]",Software,"['accelerometer', 'gyroscope']",0.8302177786827087

I will definitely be keeping the subscription after my trial is over; it''s definitely worth it.2. Daily/weekly challenges with myself and friends- I enjoy the rings concept and connecting with my friends who also have an Apple watch.

The integration with my iPhone and the ability to take and receive calls is great.  It senses a fall which since I am well into my senior years means a lot.  While there are an abundance of health and fitness apps for the SE I’d have to say that the Fitbit App beats anything I have found so far for the SE.  The Fitbit had a battery life that lasted about a week - the SE barely  makes it through one day if you use very many of the SE’s capabilities - a real problem if you use the sleep monitoring function.  Overall the SE is a great, solid feeling watch, but is very lacking is a couple of critical areas.","['Software', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.44476181268692017, 0.3162735402584076, 0.23896467685699463]",Software,['battery'],0.44476181268692017

1287,"UPGRADES from Watch SE (2020):-S8 chip: Up to 20% faster than previous Watch SE in theory (previous version was using S5 chip)-Crash detection:  Will detect if you are in a crash (same tech in iPhone14 and Watch Series 8)-Price: Starts at $249, currently older Watch SE (2020) is still priced at $269Other changes:  Back of watch is no longer ceramic, now just plastic and aluminumSo, not huge changes from the previous SE really.  This watch comes with OS 9, but the older SE (2020) is also able to upgrade its software to Watch OS 9.  So far in testing, the battery life also seems to be about the same as the older SE.  So OVERALL, it does not seem to me to be worth upgrading from the old SE to this SE2.  I haven’t been able to notice much of a difference, and I actually prefer the ceramic back of the old SE (2020).  If you feel the need to upgrade from SE (2020), you might want to look at the other new Watch 8 models that have more features.----CHOOSING BETWEEN WATCH SE2 AND WATCH 8?:Compared to Watch Series 8, this SE2 is missing these features:-No ECG, No blood oxygen, No temp sensor:  These sensors on Watch 8 can provide more health data.-No fast charging:  Fast Charging is supported on Watch 7 series and Watch 8 series (including Watch Ultra).-No IP6X dust resistance:  Watch 8 has an IP6X rating, which means that it is safe from dust/debris.-No Always-On-Display:  Watch 8 has Always-On-Display.-Size:  The Watch 8 face is bigger (41mm and 45mm, vs 40mm and 44mm), but with smaller bezels; resulting in 20% more screen area on Watch 8 compared to SE2.-No U1 Ultra-Wideband: U1 chip allows for more precise location of devices, for use in multiple applications.-Battery:  Watch 8 has 308mAh battery, SE2 is listed at 296mAh (both rated 18 hours though).Currently Watch 8 is about $150 more than SE2, so it is up to you to decide if you want to spend more to get access to these additional features.  For me, the biggest noticeable differences between the two are the screen size, Always-On-Display, and charging speeds.  The Always-On-Display makes a difference of a second or two whenever you get a notification, not a huge deal but noticeable.  I also like the faster charging of Watch 8 because I usually sleep with my Watch on to get sleep tracking data, so I mainly charge during the day, and being able to do that faster means more time actually wearing the watch.Ultimately, you’ll have to decide what is important to you, and if you need an even more rugged/durable Watch for lots of rough outdoor use, there is always the Watch 8 Ultra.  Ultra is even bigger, brighter, and more durable, with a bigger battery and feature designed to cater to outdoor activities.","['Software', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.6148467659950256, 0.2858026325702667, 0.09935062378644943]",Software,['battery'],0.6148467659950256

1322,"I bought the excellent condition refurbished SE and it came quickly in the mail, but it was free-floating in a small FedEx box(there wasn’t even bubble wrap around the actual watch piece), leaving a ton of opportunities for damage to occur. I saw some people received there’s in the original apple box, but that wasn’t the case for me. It arrived completely dead and not fully updated, which was simple to deal with but just a little bit of an inconvenience. On the plus side, the battery capacity was at 100%, which is great for a refurbished piece, maybe they replaced the battery. The glass screen of my watch also has a fairly large scratch on it, which was disappointing because I paid the extra money for “excellent condition”, and I personally wouldn’t consider it excellent. My watch didn’t come with the user manual, which I solved by just using the apple store website, but it would’ve been nice to have.Overall, this is a great option to save money but be weary of how it ships, I definitely think this store should invest in better shipping products (so that they aren’t liable for damage during shipping when the product was maybe in perfect condition before it was sent out)!

1371,"The Apple Watch series 8 is an all around great smart watch, especially if you are involved in the Apple ecosystem. It has solid battery life, easily making it through a full day off one charge. The apps available are quite convenient and make you feel much less of a need to pull out your phone constantly throughout the day. I initially did not think much of the car crash safety feature, but I've got to admit there is something comforting about knowing your watch can act as a life alert help signal in the event of a car crash. Hopefully I never need to rely on that feature but it is comforting to know it is there. The health features like the blood oxygen monitor are also quite useful, and supposedly the monitor as reliable as a medical-grade device according to a recent study in the Digital Health open access journal.Overall I am quite pleased with this smart watch and think it was a fantastic purchase.","['Software', 'Design Specifications', 'Advertising']","[0.4344748556613922, 0.2886772155761719, 0.2768479287624359]",Software,['battery'],0.4344748556613922
1372,"I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven't had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch's ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn't really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night.","['Design Specifications', 'Software', 'Advertising']","[0.4733229875564575, 0.3744864761829376, 0.15219052135944366]",Design Specifications,['battery'],0.4733229875564575

While the Series-8 includes a new “temperature” sensor, the Series-7 comes with lots of color options that matches your style and taste.  In all honesty, the “temperature” feature is not even what you expect it to be, I thought it could track my actual temperature and it would tell me if I’m getting a fever or something.  It doesn’t do that, it was meant to track “ovulation.”  As a male, it is pointless, I would rather have the color options.  Additionally, in terms of accuracy, sleep tracking, and battery life, it is just ok.  It is no better than the Series-7 in terms of battery life, the accuracy of readings and sleep tracking is ok at best.
