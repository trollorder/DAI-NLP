never use but i literally get 8 10 day on a single charge i know there are a plethora of other smart watch that get 5 10 day on a single charge what the heck can not apple create a watch that doe that i am sure this new watch will get 3 5 day if you are not going crazy with every single feature for me i want sleep tracking step and track my workout that is it i might think about going back to the

ericsson mbw 100 this watch wa a mechanical watch with an led display at the bottom for notification and music and had playback control on the side and incredibly there are still watch that follow similar principle the most modern one i have seen use e ink display a the watch face with hand that will move out of the way whenever you get a notification or navigate through certain menu and setting one of the popular example of a watch with this setup being fossil is hybrid hr watch these however do not have replaceable battery but do have rechargeable battery that only need recharging once every 2 week but another type is a hybrid watch that ha no display at all and will instead point to a number on the dial that you can assign to notification relating to an app or a contact personally i have not had a good experience with fossil is version of these watch on android i had syncing issue and on io it would only accept notification from apps that fossil had personally whitelisted no idea why especially since their hybrid hr watch support all apps but that is how it is but there are other company that make these including none other than armani these watch look like normal watch and do not use much power which is how they are able to keep going for an entire year or more but yeah i have not seen a single hybrid that support third party application and sadly they are rather underrated a watch sure they are more minimalist when it get to functionality but they do have a kind of secret agent spy watch kind of quality to them that i think make them stand out',

than according to apple 17 hour he will be out of battery thru hiker i do not think so 300 500mah of battery you need every evening if you are out in mountain for 1 2 week you do not want to spare
