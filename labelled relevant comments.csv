553,definitely a great evolution for the apple watch but i wonder if the upgraded feature are truly enough for the hardcore adventurer for example 100m water resistance will take you deeper but is that a static 100m most true dive watch are rated for 200 300m because when you are moving the watch around under water you put a lot more pressure on the seal and entry point than just having it sit there 99 99percent of diver will not go to 200m but that is not what the rating actually mean also for those who are doing multi day hike in the backcounty the extra battery life is great but when you are constantly running gps to track your mileage and route compass etc that battery life i am sure is much lower than the rating so it is great for maybe 1 2 full day of hiking but what about multi day excursion i doubt it would last for a 2 3 day backpacking trip with all the function running it is definitely a good step for the casual outdoors person but for my more hardcore outing i will stick with my garmin fenix and i do use an apple watch for everyday work around home purpose it is a much better smartwatch but it is not purpose built the way garmin etc are,"['Design Specifications', 'Software', 'Advertising']","[0.4831143021583557, 0.30408546328544617, 0.2128002643585205]",Design Specifications,['battery'],0.4831143021583557
