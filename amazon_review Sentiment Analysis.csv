0,Love this Watch!,5.0,"I never thought I would need an Apple Watch; however, after getting one I have been so impressed.  It not only keeps great time, but it helps monitor my sleep and keeps track of my steps and workouts. It has also helped me locate my phone several times since I always seem to misplace it!!  I did have to change the rubber band that came with it, but I love the new leather one.  A great purchase.","April 8, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9992357492446899
1,Watch works great!,5.0,The listing was spot on! there are a few minor scratches to the screen. They are minor enough where a finger nail does not grab the scratches. The rest of the watch seems to be perfect! I tested the Oxygen sensor and BPM compared to a  medical unit I have and its within 1-2% accuracy. Definitely recommend this seller for posting accurate details about an item.,"April 2, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9973669648170471
2,Wonderful!!,5.0,"I will admitted I was a little scriptable about purchasing the apple watch, but was glad that I take that chance once I received it. Since I’ve had it I haven’t had any problems with it and the battery life on the watch is wonderful. I would say take your chances on purchasing this item if it’s something you would really like.","April 2, 2023",POSITIVE,0.999711811542511
3,Great Renewed Apple Watch,5.0,I ordered this Watch in excellent like new condition and it is! Works perfectly. Arrived with 80% on the battery life.

4,Very good,4.0,"I was mostly concerned with the battery life. Thankfully, I received mine at 94%. I bought it in good condition. It has minor scratches. I must say it was a fantastic buy!

17,Arrived in good condition - band too large - update phone,4.0,"I’ve only had the watch actually on and working for maybe 30 minutes now but I did receive it in great cosmetic condition. It came in a generic box with the watch, band, and charger (no box to plug into wall). There are no scratches and the band is new. The battery wasn’t charged and it did take 2.5 hours to get fully charged. I didn’t realize my phone didn’t have the latest iOS (16) so I did have to update my phone and that was annoying but not the sellers fault by any means. I am annoyed that I couldn’t choose the band size because the one that was sent is way too big and I’ll have to buy a new one as I didn’t see where I could contact the seller about this. I’ll update this review after I’ve had the watch for a while.","November 10, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9971305727958679
18,Gave me trouble setting up,5.0,"It came as the expected size, but as I went to pair the watch to my phone it’s still under someone else’s iCloud and the only way I can set up my watch is if the original owner removes the watch from their account and I have no clue who it is so I’m gonna have to return it","February 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,0.9996985197067261

20,The dreaded red snake,4.0,"Well, I’d like to say I’m happy but I’m not. Bought a new (refurbished) Apple Watch 6 and here’s how it arrived…with the dreaded red snake of death. And I can’t get it to charge. Now according to YT, this is a fairly common issue that is fixable with an easy home hack so let me give it a chance and try this home remedy and then I’ll update this rating accordingly. But for now…I’m not a very satisfied customer. When you spend a couple hundred $$$ on a new (refurbished) product (esp an Apple product) you shouldn’t have to jump through special hoops just to get it to work right.Update: Ok well, the hack worked and my watch is up and running so that’s a plus. But like I said before, when you drop a couple hundred bucks on a new product, you expect it to work right out of the box. If I hadn’t looked up that hack, I would’ve returned the watch and been a dissatisfied customer with a pretty negative rating.","September 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9979602098464966
21,DONT RISK IT - BROKEN AND NO REFUND - WORST AMAZON EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD,1.0,"I wish I had images- I would have if they had not readily accepted my request to return they day it arrived. This product is advertised as excellent condition- it could not be further from that. To begin, a came with some minor scratches- okay, that's not too big a deal, I'm gonna buy a case for it anyway. Then, as I am setting up the watch , I notice that the screen physically moves into the watch as I press buttons. It was pretty dark in my room, so I turn on the lights, take a closer look and it appears that either A) The screen had come off and they had tried to glue it back together with the equivalent of elementary Elmer's glue OR B) The Apple Watch adhesive had been extremely used and worn out- to the point where the adhesive was ""leaking"" over the edges of the screen- something fatal they failed to inspect. I am almost sure it is the former given that the adhesive seems it was applied as the real apple watch adhesive is located inside the lining of the screen rather than on its outside edges. Obviously, this scenario is far worse and demonstrates the carelessness of this company. This I presume would be a major compromise of the waterproof aspect of the watch as under the screen, all of the mechanics are exposed to the elements. Cases are often not waterproof either for the Apple Watch since the watch itself is already waterproof, so that would not fix the issue. Now, I did request to refund the day of, reporting the exact issue, and wow! They accepted! Happy Ending! Not quite.As you might expect, the customer service was not great either.I will admit that I physically returned it a few weeks after- I was terribly busy and this apple watch that I was already promised a refund for was not at the top of my list of concerns. By the way- the deadline was in late December. I had returned it in the first third of the time they wanted it back. Fast-forward, and I see that they had charged me a ""restocking fee"" of HALF OF PRICE OF THE WATCH. I payed $270 for this ""excellent condition"" device only to be dealt a hole of $135 in the wallet. I was essentially paying to repair the watch, and for them to sell it to another poor soul. The cost to actually repair it is much cheaper by the way, and you could probably do a better job. Nowhere do they mention a restocking fee, especialIy not such a large one. I, obviously angry, had to control myself when talking to their customer service- which was hardly a service and more of an insult. I asked for a full refund in what one would consider polite given the circumstances. Here's the kicker. They had the AUDACITY to claim that I, MYSELF, had broken it because it was not returned immediately after receival. Don't be mistaken, they would likely come up with another excuse to only refund you half of your money even if you returned it earlier than myself. The apple watch was not used a single day after my initial complaint, yet the customer service had the incredible nerve to claim that it was my fault. They somehow believe that I had bought the watch, and planned to break and return it. They genuinely believe that somebody would buy the watch and report damage the day after so that they could use it for a month, THEN break it in the exact way as described, THEN return it. Not even a legitimate scammer would plan that- logically, its just not cost efficient, practical, or useful. The customer service was vague and almost condescending.Just because they have some sort of Amazon Renewed Certification does not mean it will be anywhere close to ""like new"" or excellent folks. You would think that for a company selling the same items tagged in progressively ascending order of quality (They have the same watch at different prices for ""good"" ""Very Good"" and ""Excellent"") would have an at least decent ""Excellent"" option. What an absolute joke and a horrible experience to ruin my week.Just don't risk it. Heads you get an overpriced used Apple Watch. Tails, you dig yourself a $135 hole.","November 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9995560050010681

26,Love it!,5.0,"Long story, but the price of a refurbished Apple 6 Watch was just as much as the Fi… that I returned that was a Christmas gift that didn’t even come close to having all the functions. The battery life is great; I was worried at first, but after each full day of wearing it and playing with it, by bedtime it is usually down between 68% - 64%. It works as describes, connected easy to my phone, and looks great. I don’t wear watches or jewelry to bed so I haven use the the sleep tracking. I’m trying to talk my brother into one from the same suppler. Very happy with it.","January 8, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9771448969841003
27,Hopefully your luck is better than mine...,3.0,"I am trying to buy this for a 3rd time, only because after some looking it seems that each time I have got this it has been from a different seller. The first time the sensor on the back of the watch was cracked really bad, which I'm sure would have voided any waterproof-ness. The second time, my husband synced it and wore it for a day and a half and a bubble had formed in the bottom of the screen. I thought it was the protector that I put on it, but surely enough it was in the actual screen! It felt like it wasn't as flush as it should have been from the get go, but I was blaming it on probably not being the original screen so it wasn't going to feel as perfect as if it were. It also had some dirt/makeup caked in the holes, which I thought was gross and could have been cleaned better.Either way, I am now trying to purchase it for a 3rd time, hopefully 3rd times a charm since they are supposed to be ""excellent"" condition! But if you are going to try for it I would definitely inspect it well before doing too much with it.","December 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9993519186973572

The watch body arrived in AS NEW condition, in the box it had originally, and with a renewed standard band that I refused to put on the body. I had ordered a heavy stainless band for the watch, and it fit perfectly, and made the watch feel normal on my wrist. I’m frankly using apps on this watch, that I never thought I would, for health, wellness, mindfulness, and activity. I love this Series 6, and the price vs. a Series 7 makes it truly a bargain.

My latest, the Series 6, came packaged in the original box with new (or at least they appeared new) accessories. It was also delivered to my door in record time by FedEx. Now, one might argue that the Apple Watch itself is a bit pricey for what you get, but I like the seamless extension of my iPhone and the advantages that gives over other smart watches. And the price-to-value discussion has been beat to death. To my mind, it’s worth it. To others, not so much.

240,Honestly…it’s worth it,5.0,"I was extremely skeptical of the Apple Watch when it first hit the market. To be frank, I thought they were pretentious and unnecessary. Over time, I saw how my friends and coworkers enjoyed theirs, so I decided to jump on the bandwagon and I am so glad I did. I will be the first to admit I was wrong.Like a fair amount of the American population, I have ADD. Also like a fair amount of the American population, I sit behind a computer from 8-5. I would hyper focus and go hours working on a project without standing or taking a break. With my apple watch, it quietly and quickly vibrates every hour to remind me to stand up, and I will walk a lap. Then come back to my work. I like the challenge of meeting my goals (which are adjustable) and I can “compete” with my friends in different states for bragging rights regarding meeting goals.I also do not “doomsday scroll” on my iPhone at nights as much, because I can leave my phone in another room knowing I won’t miss a text or a call due to the texts/calls coming through on my watch.Overall, as ridiculous as typing it out is, this watch has been a good tool for my mental and physical health. I’ve lost weight (and kept it off). I will cave and admit that this watch is great.","March 24, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9587830901145935
241,Happy with my purchase!,5.0,"I finally bought an Apple watch because I've been wanting to improve my mental health with more physical activities. At first I was annoyed by all the notifications I received on the watch; it's essentially a mirror of your smartphone. After I turned most of them off except phone calls/texts it was much better to use.While the battery life is not as long as other competition out there, there are some features that I think make the watch worth it:1. Fitness+- LOVE THIS APP! I'm currently trailing it free for 3 months, and it's a game changer. I love how there is new content weekly for different exercises like kickboxing, pilates, HIIT, yoga, dance, etc. I have a smart tv and stream the videos on there. I get to see my heart rate and calories burned LIVE, so it motivates me to work harder. You can also filter the exercises by duration, music genre, fitness instructor, and more! I will definitely be keeping the subscription after my trial is over; it''s definitely worth it.2. Daily/weekly challenges with myself and friends- I enjoy the rings concept and connecting with my friends who also have an Apple watch. I get notifications of when they complete a workout, which encourages me to exercise myself.3. Find My- I use this app constantly to find my phone in another room.4. Direct streaming to my iPhone- it is nice to see my stats on my phoneOverall, if you're considering getting an Apple Watch, do it. I selected this one because I don't need the data option, and this is a budget friendly enough device for so much value.","March 6, 2023",POSITIVE,0.984531044960022
242,I'd give it 5 stars if the charger was actually a USB!,4.0,"I've had several Apple watches and so far have been happy with them.  My one complaint is that I HAVE NO WAY TO CHARGE THIS THING, and thank goodness I have my charger from the previous watch.  While the charger it comes with looks just like the others, the end of it IS NOT USB.  It is much smaller and I have absolutely NOTHING in my possession that I can plug it into.  I thought it would plug into my phone, perhaps, but it doesn't fit.  I have an Apple computer but there are no ports that match the watch charger, either.  So, I'm SOL on using the charger it came with until I figure out what to do.  I realize all I need is to perhaps buy something but I'm not willing to go there since I can use my other charger which works fine.  As for the watch itself, I really do like it.  I appreciate the extra storage space and it definitely works faster.  I can store more music in it and the large variety of watch faces is a plus for me.  There are more than enough apps on this and I turned off the ones I know I'll never use - some are ridiculous - such as, it senses when you are washing your hands and starts a 20 second timer.  That's too much ""big brother"" type stuff for me - I don't need help.  I would recommend that if you are replacing this with an older Apple Watch that you choose the manual setup and don't allow it to automatically set based on your old watch.  This is how I was able to catch what I would consider too much nosiness and turn it off.  I mainly use the watch for running, listening to music, catching phone calls and emails, etc...just daily stuff.  So I don't need anything over the top.  However, for the average person, this is a great watch with more than enough functions.  All of the bands for my previous watch fit it as well.  Just know that if you purchase this, you won't be disappointed with the watch itself, but beware that you won't be able to charge in a USB.  I don't know what Apple was thinking on that one.  Finally, there are NO charging instructions or explanations.","January 16, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9785611629486084

I do wish it had face dial with larger Day/Date in the corner. My 64  year old eyes cant see the smaller Date or Temp in the corners.

I have the gps only watch so I don’t know how it fares on a cellular network but it’s nice that you can walk a bit of distance from your watch and still have access to the internet. I mostly use the watch to get notifications from my phone without having to take out my phone (at work).,"February 13, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9983822107315063

But it’s actually done the opposite! I check my messages real quick and don’t have to pull my phone out of my purse! Battery life is ok. I have to charge mine every night. Plus there are so many bands and cases you can get for it to Make it your own style!,"February 24, 2023",POSITIVE,0.9989243149757385

Battery is the same as my old watch (s5). Will last all day and through the night but needs to be placed on charger to last the next morning which is fine because I take mine off every night and place it on it’s charger til 100% then turn it off until next day. Came with small size band which were perfect. Beautiful color. Came with charging  cord. NOTE: the charging cable is a C charger. have to have a C port charging block. Over all I love it so much.

261,Great features but lacking a couple of critical ones,4.0,"I had the Fitbit Versa 2 prior to purchasing the Apple Watch SE.  I love a number of the features that I did not have before.  The integration with my iPhone and the ability to take and receive calls is great.  It senses a fall which since I am well into my senior years means a lot.  While there are an abundance of health and fitness apps for the SE I’d have to say that the Fitbit App beats anything I have found so far for the SE.  The Fitbit had a battery life that lasted about a week - the SE barely  makes it through one day if you use very many of the SE’s capabilities - a real problem if you use the sleep monitoring function.  Overall the SE is a great, solid feeling watch, but is very lacking is a couple of critical areas.","January 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,0.9774511456489563

269,Least expensive option for a new 2022 Apple Watch,4.0,"UPGRADES from Watch SE (2020):-S8 chip: Up to 20% faster than previous Watch SE in theory (previous version was using S5 chip)-Crash detection:  Will detect if you are in a crash (same tech in iPhone14 and Watch Series 8)-Price: Starts at $249, currently older Watch SE (2020) is still priced at $269Other changes:  Back of watch is no longer ceramic, now just plastic and aluminumSo, not huge changes from the previous SE really.  This watch comes with OS 9, but the older SE (2020) is also able to upgrade its software to Watch OS 9.  So far in testing, the battery life also seems to be about the same as the older SE.  So OVERALL, it does not seem to me to be worth upgrading from the old SE to this SE2.  I haven’t been able to notice much of a difference, and I actually prefer the ceramic back of the old SE (2020).  If you feel the need to upgrade from SE (2020), you might want to look at the other new Watch 8 models that have more features.----CHOOSING BETWEEN WATCH SE2 AND WATCH 8?:Compared to Watch Series 8, this SE2 is missing these features:-No ECG, No blood oxygen, No temp sensor:  These sensors on Watch 8 can provide more health data.-No fast charging:  Fast Charging is supported on Watch 7 series and Watch 8 series (including Watch Ultra).-No IP6X dust resistance:  Watch 8 has an IP6X rating, which means that it is safe from dust/debris.-No Always-On-Display:  Watch 8 has Always-On-Display.-Size:  The Watch 8 face is bigger (41mm and 45mm, vs 40mm and 44mm), but with smaller bezels; resulting in 20% more screen area on Watch 8 compared to SE2.-No U1 Ultra-Wideband: U1 chip allows for more precise location of devices, for use in multiple applications.-Battery:  Watch 8 has 308mAh battery, SE2 is listed at 296mAh (both rated 18 hours though).Currently Watch 8 is about $150 more than SE2, so it is up to you to decide if you want to spend more to get access to these additional features.  For me, the biggest noticeable differences between the two are the screen size, Always-On-Display, and charging speeds.  The Always-On-Display makes a difference of a second or two whenever you get a notification, not a huge deal but noticeable.  I also like the faster charging of Watch 8 because I usually sleep with my Watch on to get sleep tracking data, so I mainly charge during the day, and being able to do that faster means more time actually wearing the watch.Ultimately, you’ll have to decide what is important to you, and if you need an even more rugged/durable Watch for lots of rough outdoor use, there is always the Watch 8 Ultra.  Ultra is even bigger, brighter, and more durable, with a bigger battery and feature designed to cater to outdoor activities.","September 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9989136457443237

Previous versions/software updates had a tiny keyboard you swipe across and it uses predictive text to pick your word. This one has a voice text option, and instead of a keyboard, a little screen on which you write each letter with your finger. You have to press space after each word, and doesn’t understand cursive so you have to lift your finger each time. Some letters are confused for others (I.e.: if I want to write 1, I can’t just draw a line. I have to draw a classic one. J’s can be U’s, p’s can be misconstrued as b’s if you’re going too fast.) It takes forever and is annoying and unhelpful in times when it’s inappropriate to use voice text.

I didn't think there would be much use for it other than the fitness tracker but I was pleasantly surprised. The fitness tracking is great but I am highly suspicious of the estimated calories burned when tracking traditional weight training. Having Apple Pay on your wrist is really convenient and the walkie-talkie function is super cool. I also like how you can answer phone calls from your wrist in case your phone isn't on you at the time. I am terrible about charging my devices so I wish the battery life was better but you can get through a solid day and a half if you aren't fiddling with the watch too much.

This one is actually comfortable to wear.For $250, this is a good watch. Battery life is the same as the Watch 8. Charging speed is similar.

If you are considering this watch look at the difference between the SE and 8 or 8 plus.  Further, if battery life is an issue the 8 plus offers  by far the longest battery life. They have the always on face and a couple of features which the SE does not. The always on face and other features were really not important to me.  However, go to the Apple Website and look at the feature comparisons.  They may very well be worth you spending a little more money for the upgrade.

I feel like it helps me stay off my phone but aware if someone messages me. I know someone with an older version and I can definitely tell the difference in speed while doing normal typing/ scrolling etc. I am glad I got this one due to the not lagging speed compared to other.

338,MUST READ!,3.0,"If you are having trouble pairing this to your iPhone please read the following review. First you must have an iPhone 8 or newer model. Second, and most importantly, you must be running iOS 16 or greater. I got this watch a few days ago and I could not wait to pair it with my iPhone 13.It would pair then unpair and over and over again. I tried to manually pair it, I reset my phone, the watch, my network settings (all of these tips were found online) but none of them mentioned needing the latest iOS. My phone updates automatically so I assumed I was on the latest iOS. I was not.It took me about 45 minutes for the phone and watch to update and finally pair.This watch is good but not great. The battery life is just not there yet. If you want to wear this watch for the fitness aspect of it and track your sleep data as well as have it as a shortcut to read messages and see notifications throughout the day it doesn’t give you much time during the day or night to charge it. I did all the battery saving tips and it was still only good for about a day and a half. Kinda like my phone. And it gets worse if you want full functionality.I also wanted to use this with my Arccos golf tracking system but the battery really goes quick using gps for an entire round of golf and it does not give you anything more than a very plain numeric only display with basic yardages. It was very comfortable to wear and it does have very cool customizable watch faces but the poor battery life was a deal breaker. Sorry but it’s heading back.","November 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9991232752799988

342,Not for family plan - need cell model,3.0,"If you are wondering if this is the model to get if you want to hook this up to your phone or your family plan (for your kid) the answer is ""NO"" - this is GPS only and you need the model that has cell as well as GPS. We studied this question, and could not get a definitive answer, so bought this model because some reviews seemed to indicate this model would do the job. It did not.When we tried to hook it up this did not work out as planned. The details are in the fine print. Save yourselves the headache, spring for the extra $$ and buy the cell model. The ""cel"" model has its own phone #  - When you link the watch to your phone you can decide whether to use the watch as a phone or not (in other words, does not have to ring) but without the cell you will be unable to use this for your kid to send messages or to know their whereabouts.Sometimes technology is not easy. Apple also generally assumes you know more than you do and their explanations do not always get you where you want to be. It's not you, its them.","December 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9989556074142456

Sure, you can spend a couple hundred more for a few more features but I don't think it's worth it. I've owned a few Apple Watches and they provide a similar experience regardless of price, at least for my use cases. This watch has the latest processor which is able to give it the extra power it needs to continue to feel snappy for years to come. It's just as comfortable as any other Apple Watch.

I prefer Samsung watches’ bottom as they are flatter. But last couple of their iterations do not sync with iPhone.SE2 is much faster in everything. You can see it fly through everything.Battery is not good. Even though this doesn’t have always on function, if you wear 12hr or more you will need to charge it. Not good.Strap is mine.

I was very excited to receive it and immediately started learning all about it. The next day I then realized I should of contacted the company and let them know of the scratches but by that time I had invested my time and info into the Watch.

It's been dependable. And it's made receiving messages so convenient. I don't sleep with it on because I don't want to ""feel"" the notifications. So the battery life has been a non-issue. I charge it at night though it's rarely below about 65%. I'm very happy I finally got one and got this one.

I had been idly considering purchasing an Apple Watch for a year and when I saw this, I jumped on it even though I saw the SCATHING reviews regarding the battery life.REGARDING THE BATTERY LIFE:I found that right out of the box, the Apple Watch *did not* preform with the battery life as advertised. It only lasted about 3-4 hours fully charged.HOWEVER, after going through and TURNING OFF background app refresh and other background processes, as well as REMOVING UNNECESSARY APPS, the BATTERY LIFE IMPROVED DRASTICALLY. It has NOT EVEN hit 75% after a FULL 8 HOURS. I think the battery life is really impressive!COSMETICALLY:This watch is in REALLY GOOD condition considering it is secondhand/refurbished. I received mine with only ONE TINY CHIP to the screen.**I genuinely think this is not a watch to pass up. If you’re considering it, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going through all of the apps that come on it and remove unnecessary ones as well as turning off any background processes. That should improve battery life amazingly.**Thank you!","September 13, 2022",POSITIVE,0.9915891289710999
517,Satisfied but a bit disappointed…,3.0,"I bought the excellent condition refurbished SE and it came quickly in the mail, but it was free-floating in a small FedEx box(there wasn’t even bubble wrap around the actual watch piece), leaving a ton of opportunities for damage to occur. I saw some people received there’s in the original apple box, but that wasn’t the case for me. It arrived completely dead and not fully updated, which was simple to deal with but just a little bit of an inconvenience. On the plus side, the battery capacity was at 100%, which is great for a refurbished piece, maybe they replaced the battery. The glass screen of my watch also has a fairly large scratch on it, which was disappointing because I paid the extra money for “excellent condition”, and I personally wouldn’t consider it excellent. My watch didn’t come with the user manual, which I solved by just using the apple store website, but it would’ve been nice to have.Overall, this is a great option to save money but be weary of how it ships, I definitely think this store should invest in better shipping products (so that they aren’t liable for damage during shipping when the product was maybe in perfect condition before it was sent out)! The watch works fine and has great battery health, just a bit upset about the scratch since I paid for the excellent condition.","August 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9922069907188416

I finally got this one and so far it’s been great! I like all the data and added insight into my exercises and health. I appreciate the ease of setting it up and being able to leave my phone at the house while I go for a run. The alarm wakes me up better than my noise phone alarm. I haven’t used it that long but the Spotify app and my workout apps all integrate with it quite well. My only issue is that the wrist band it came with was too small for me.

Upon opening, I thought it would be refurbished within an apple box and instead it was in a cheap box with cheap packaging. There are no instructions included besides needing to unpair - which I don’t because I just bought this.

720,"First Time Apple Watch User, Impressed!",5.0,"I am sure there are a lot of you wondering what exactly you need a smart watch for when you have a smartphone. I too was one of these people wondering the same thing asking myself if I could justify the price, how often would I use it, is it worth it, and all those questions. Meanwhile, when my sister heard I was considering one, little did I know she already had one and she was able to tell me all the benefits of them and really suggested I get one which settled it for me. So, I made the purchase.Initially, I was not sure about which size to get but historically I get larger size items like the iPhone MAX so I can see the screen, or the larger iPad, etc. So, I decided to get the larger faced watch with GPS only - I didn't see the need to get wifi personally.Once the watch arrived, I opened up the box and went through the puzzle of getting the watch, band and charging wire out of there. I admit, it was a bit complex to go through but I finally got all the components out.Setting it up was easy, paring with phone no problem.I have been using the watch for a few months now. I find myself trying to be more active, monitoring my heart more and monitoring my sleeping which is one of the important reasons I got the watch. The watch itself isn't causing me to sleep better, but I can identify the times I'm awake during the night and make adjustments with my sleep schedule to get more sleep which has worked for me. The watch tells me to stand up and move are around (I work a 9-5 desk job and never took a moment to stretch) as well as to take a moment to breathe and clear my mind - all good features. Not only do I work 9-5 at the desk, afterhours and weekends I'm doing mechanical work, work where you typically have two hands occupied and really greasy and dirty. I was surprised I could call from and receive calls to the watch instead of having to drop everything, clean up, find my phone and take important calls.The strap/band the watch comes with is alright, but I made the mistake of putting them on the watch the wrong way which, if you do the same thing, it is very easy for the strap to come unbuttoned and the watch will come off. Once this was pointed out to me and corrected, it is much more secure and easy to clean (again, grease/grime/dirt from mechanical work). I would suggest you have different bands for different activities you do as the original band sometimes makes my wrist tired after a long day of wear.I opted not to get any sort of protective case or screen for the watch but your preferences may differ. I also choose not to wear it in water even though it is water resistant.BATTERY: It will last me a day before I need to charge. Do not expect it to last days on end. However, it does charge pretty fast so you can put it on the charger when you find time for a break during the day. I choose to charge it either at night before bed when I'm getting things ready for the next day, and then I'll put it on before sleep. Or, I'll take it off in the morning when I wake up and charge it while I'm getting myself ready for the day.As far as recommendation - yes, I would recommend it. It has the capability of your phone without having to actually carry the phone everywhere you go around the house but I find it having more health related benefits that the phone simply can't offer you.","December 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.6296038031578064
721,Love it,4.0,"Pros:-Siri is amazing on this. I just lift my watch and tell Siri to do something. Setting timers for food cooking has never been so easy. Alarms, reminders, etc.- The color and graphics are fantastic- Fitness tracking is what I always wanted. Sometimes I have workouts where I know there’s points in the middle where I’m slacking. The watch will be able to tell if it was active calories burnt vs regular.- Tracking everything with the app is really nice. I can easily access my workouts- Calls come in pretty clear though I don’t use this feature often-Charges so fastCons:- The Sleep app is TERRIBLE. I downloaded a better one than the default and it’s still kind of annoying that I have to pick my bedtime hours to track and if I sleep outside of those hours it doesn’t teach.- Ignoring groups can be tricky. I keep trying to ignore a group and 3 days later, the notifications will be on again- Battery life isn’t the BEST, but still decentOverall, I love this watch. It can charge in like an hour so I’m pretty good at keeping it charged. The only thing I wish is if they could fix the sleep tracking. I really wanted accurate data for that.","March 25, 2023",POSITIVE,0.985153317451477
722,Upgraded from series 3 and WOW,5.0,"Love all of the features series 8 offers compared to series 3 that I've written for several years! More of my phone apps work on this watch, such as my geenie app so I can turn on and off lights from my watch.  I love the heath features, I have AFib and I'm getting old so it's important to me to keep an eye on my heart rate and blood oxygen even if I'm not at home. ECG could help me know if I need to go to the ER too.  Yes, I know my rate in my pic is high but I'm ok, I was just up and active, it's back down now. This is the 41mm, I considered the big one but as you can see my wrists are tiny and the 45mm would have been too big for me.

Now I'm using a new watch with an old band because I can't just swap bands and buying one identical to the one I have is a ridiculous price. So I'm stuck. I bought an aftermarket band, but it isn't what I truly want. To all of you ordering, be extra diligent when picking sizes.

The model 2 watch is no longer software upgradeable and the cost to change the battery in it did not seem to be the smart move with all that has changed in the watch.  I love the new brighter display and the ""constant on"" feature of the display.  The battery is still at 50% at the end of the day when I place it on the charging puck, so the battery life is great in spite of the constant on display.  I still use pretty much the same apps as I did before so the upgrade was not for the apps but for the battery and display.

756,"A nice Watch, not much of an upgrade though",4.0,"UPGRADES from Series 7:S8 Chip:  This is basically the same as the S7 chip, with a few new integrated sensors:--Temperature Sensors:  Measures wrist temp. only while sleeping, takes five days to build baseline.  Currently only used to help retroactively analyze ovulation cycles after two cycles.  Not predictive.--High G accelerometer and improved gyroscope:  Able to detect car crashes and call for help.  (Same feature available in iPhone 14)-Different Color options: (Currently no blue or green?)That’s it.  Everything else is exactly the same as the Series 7.  The only way I can even tell them apart is by the color, otherwise they look the same.  The only benefits to upgrading to a Series 8 from a Series 7 would be the improved ovulation tracking features via nighttime wrist temperature, (though Apple warns that this is not necessarily predictive and should only be used to retroactively analyze your cycles after a couple months of use, and you would have to be wearing it at night often because this feature only uses sleep temp data), or the car-crash detection (but if you are going to get an iPhone 14, then this feature will be in your phone already).  So, if you are not interested in the ovulation data (or just don’t want to wear the watch every night- because maybe you charge it at night), and you plan to get an iPhone 14, then there is no reason to upgrade to this Series 8 at all.  The series 8 does come with Watch OS 9 which has some new software features, but all Apple Watches Series 4 or later can upgrade to this same OS 9.  (So that is Series 4, 5, 6, and 7, and SE, all support upgrading to Watch OS 9)So basically, it is hard to recommend getting this Watch Series 8.  If you can live without the wrist temp ovulation analysis and car crash detection in the watch, then I would suggest sticking with Series 7.  Even Series 6 isn’t that different in terms of performance, it and will still support Watch OS 9.  If you are buying your first Apple Watch, I would still suggest getting the less expensive Series 7.  Or you could also look into the new SE 2, which is about $150 less expensive than this Series 8, but lacks several other features like the Always-On-Display, ECG, blood oxygen and IP6X rating.","September 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9988316893577576

It was easy to set up and also an easy learning curve for use. The screen is perfect! My only complaint is with Apple for not proving a USB-C plug for the USB-C cord. I’m reluctantly using my iBook plug to charge the watch until i can get a new plug. This should be explained in the numerous description information and the photos. Yeah, it shows the cord- who would think it didn’t come with the plug?I’m thrilled also that Apple partnered up with Product Red so  that i could support a cause that I have a huge respect for- that of preventing HIV and AIDS. I had a family member die of AIDS and if the research and prevention happening now had happened in the early 90s then she might not have died from a tainted blood transfusion and could’ve afforded the medication protocol. So for me- this watch is not only my favorite color, but also a purchase to support a cause I feel strongly about. Product Red also helps solve Poverty, and Health Care throughout the world.","November 3, 2022",POSITIVE,0.9954299926757812
761,Apple Watch 8,4.0,"I purchased the new Apple Watch 8 for my wife as an anniversary gift. She loves anything and everything apple, and I myself prefer other options.As for a review, I am comparing the Apple Watch 8 to my Garmin Venu 2.Many of the added and new features of Apple's newest watch, like SOS and biometrics monitoring, have been a staple in their competitors' products for a while now.Comparing the responsiveness of the Series 8 to the Venu 2 is quite a big leap, as the Series 8 has a faster chip and can perform many tasks, including video animations like Toy Story characters running around the screen with phenomenal clarity and resolution, which is one thing it does that my Garmin does not.Comparing the reliability, however, does show how Apple is lacking in the functionality of its watch. To start, the GPS signal in the Garmin is better than the Series 8 when out in the wilderness or anywhere where the signal may not be as great, whereas the Series 8 seems to lack a proper signal. As well as my Garmin has more accurate biometrics reading when comparing our vitals being monitored with a pulse oximetry device.Overall the build quality seems comparable to my Garmin, as both have been plunged into deep enough water, both in the ocean and in 10'  swimming pools. Neither has shown any water damage since. For impact damage, the Apple watch seems to be more resilient as my Venu 2 has a few dings here and there for it hitting desks, and normal wear and tear, yet the Apple Watch still looks as good as it did out of the box.Overall, the Apple Watch 8 is a great product for someone who likes to stay in the Apple ecosystem.","October 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9595798850059509

I wish the health, fitness, and watch apps were better integrated so that you didn’t have to switch between the three of them to see all of your data in detail, but it’s not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. My only issue is that Siri sometimes thinks I am talking to my watch and writes/sends text messages without me meaning to.

Sleep tracking is excellent, heart rate monitor and blood oxygen sensor are very useful. The alarm hasn’t failed me yet.The downside? Having all of those features constantly monitoring for changes drains the battery quicker than I’d like. Note that I dimmed the brightness of the display and turned off the “always on” feature. It helped a bit but to get the most out of the battery, you’ll have to turn off the active monitoring features.Low power mode is always an option if you’re really needing to conserve battery but it turns off 99 percent of features to do this.I have a charger nearby 95 percent of the time so that minimizes the issue somewhat.I‘d give it a half star back if that was an option (so realistically a 4.5 out of 5)Some people will say get the Ultra if you need a better battery, but I couldn’t justify $800.","October 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9853744506835938

I initially did not think much of the car crash safety feature, but I've got to admit there is something comforting about knowing your watch can act as a life alert help signal in the event of a car crash. Hopefully I never need to rely on that feature but it is comforting to know it is there. The health features like the blood oxygen monitor are also quite useful, and supposedly the monitor as reliable as a medical-grade device according to a recent study in the Digital Health open access journal.Overall I am quite pleased with this smart watch and think it was a fantastic purchase.","October 30, 2022",POSITIVE,0.9986172914505005

It has a ton of features and customizations and if you download the Facer app from the app store (it's free) you can do even more customizations to the watch face to get exactly what you want. The O2 monitor, heart rate, and ECG monitors are also nice features with this model so if you are concerned with those issues, this watch is for you.

801,Replaced a Series 5 Apple Watch,3.0,"I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven't had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an ""Unsuccessful Measurement"" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch's ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn't really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night.","November 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,0.9991348385810852

Also another app for my walking steps to show on the face screen, then Apple fitness is also additional and not free. It all seems messy and all over the place not to have everything under the one watch. It’s a matter of preference.

While the Series-8 includes a new “temperature” sensor, the Series-7 comes with lots of color options that matches your style and taste.  In all honesty, the “temperature” feature is not even what you expect it to be, I thought it could track my actual temperature and it would tell me if I’m getting a fever or something.  It doesn’t do that, it was meant to track “ovulation.”  As a male, it is pointless, I would rather have the color options.  Additionally, in terms of accuracy, sleep tracking, and battery life, it is just ok.  It is no better than the Series-7 in terms of battery life, the accuracy of readings and sleep tracking is ok at best.
